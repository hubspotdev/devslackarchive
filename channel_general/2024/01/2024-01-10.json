    "text": "Hm, a random nitpick I just noticed — it’s basically impossible for a HubSpot site to have 100% valid markup because of an issue with the standard Rich Text module. The `hs_cos_wrapper_type_rich_text` wrapper uses a `&lt;span&gt;` element, which can’t contain flow content like `&lt;h1&gt;–&lt;h6&gt;` or `&lt;p&gt;`. _(or basically anything else that you can do with the rich text module)_\n\nSince the `&lt;span&gt;` wrapper is contained within another, outer wrapper that uses a `&lt;div&gt;`, switching that inner wrapper to a `&lt;div&gt;` should correct the validation issue without an effect on layout or semantics."
