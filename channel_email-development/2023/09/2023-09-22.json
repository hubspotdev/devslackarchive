    "text": "Hello HubSpot Community,\nI hope everyone is doing well. I'm reaching out to seek guidance on a challenge I've been facing with our weekly newsletters. Every week, I have to create a newsletter that features multiple articles. The current process involves manually inputting an image, meta description, and link for each article, which is quite time-consuming.\nIs there any way to automate or streamline the process of embedding these links into our marketing emails? Ideally, I'm looking for a solution where I can simply paste the article link, and it automatically fetches the image and meta description, similar to how some social media platforms preview links.\nIf anyone has faced a similar challenge and found a solution or if there are any tools or integrations within HubSpot that can assist with this, I would greatly appreciate your insights.\nThank you in advance for your help and suggestions!",

I did a quick test and was able to add <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/module-theme-fields#blog|a Blog Field> to a module, so it would track that you should be able to use that to pull recent post information."
