    "text": "Hi all! Happy Friday! We have a client (dentist) who offers Online Consultations. They are using a HubSpot form and asking people to upload 5 photos and a video. The client is complaining because a lot of potential patients are calling saying the form isn’t working - this is due to the fact it takes like 10 / 20 minutes to upload the pictures and people think it isn’t working and leave the page.\n\nHas anyone experienced the same? Any ideas to solve the issue? Thanks!!",

    "text": "Well uploading a video will always take awhile especially if you're not limiting the duration to something very short and requesting a more compressed format. Video files are big because they're not easy to compress without losing significant quality. I would consider it possible having users upload the videos through a form that can display am upload progress bar. Don't think you can do that with a HubSpot form alone."
