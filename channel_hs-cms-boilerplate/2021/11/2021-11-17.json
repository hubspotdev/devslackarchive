    "text": "Hey Jacob :wave: the boilerplate is intended to be a bit more bare bones so that a developer can use it as a starting point for one of their projects and add onto it as they please. This is more focused towards helping developers build out a new theme using HubSpot.\n\nThe Growth theme is more intended for new content creators who might not necessarily have a developer and are getting started on HubSpot. This is meant to give them an out of the box starting point. This theme is a lot more opinionated than boilerplate.\n\nWe want to make sure we keep boilerplate a bit more simple than Growth so that developers don't have to go through the hassle of deleting a lot of things they don't necessarily want/need. With that being said you can still download Growth if you want to use some of the approaches/techniques that we offer there (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes/default-themes#growth-theme>). Most of the features/techniques discussed in that developer day presentation in Growth theme we also feature in boilerplate."
