    "text": "We’re working on a new integration and want to integrate HubSpot and Jira.  When a new deal enters a specific stage we’d like for it to trigger and create a ticket in Jira.   We’re pretty new to HubSpot so I want to be sure we are thinking about it the right way.  We have the operations hub on our account (if that matters). What we are thinking is using a workflow in HubSpot that watches for a deal to move into a stage, from there, send a webhook out of HubSpot.  As far as I can tell the SaaS version of Jira can’t accept a webhook…so we’d have a Lambda set up to receive the web hook them push the data into Jira via the API. Are we thinking about this right? Any better ways to do this in HubSpot.",
