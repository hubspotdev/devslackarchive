Drag and drop areas represent the future of how marketer-friendly websites are built on the HubSpot CMS, while allowing developers to utilize coded files, and the tools and technologies they prefer.\n\nTo get started building using drag and drop areas, follow the getting started guide here <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tutorials/drag-and-drop-areas>. You can also check out the <#CMXUWUY5D|hs-cms-boilerplate> templates, which utilize this syntax <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/tree/master/src/templates>\n\nAs always, please send any feedback along in <#CDU990ECW|drag-n-drop-pages> or to myself!",
