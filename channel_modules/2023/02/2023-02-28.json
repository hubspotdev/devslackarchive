Currently, we have a search bar in our CMS that shows matching search results in a dropdown format. While our platform is built on VueJS and we would like to integrate our HubSpot CMS search bar into our SPA (Single Page Application).\n\nWe are seeking guidance on the best approach to achieve this integration. If anyone help us out on that, it would be highly appreciated.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Well hello people - I’m being driven nuts by a problem I’m attempting to solve for within a custom quote template and its modules. Hoping one of you can save the day.\n\nI have several line item modules that are to be used in a single quote theme/template. Within these modules, I have a great deal of calculations being performed based on line item values. These values do not match those supplied within the templateData variable.\n\nThe catch - I need to roll all of these calculated values up to either the template, or another module to then render it on the page. Is this possible? If so, how on Earth do I do this. I’ve spent the past hour getting creative with searches in both google and in this slack. To no avail.\n\nHappy to provide more details if needed, but as a quick example:\n\nlocally set variable, “total_price_1” in line_item_mod_1 == 1\nlocally set variable, “total_price_2\" in line_item_mod_2 == 2\n\nI want to be able to access both values, 1 and 2 at the template level (total_price_1 + total_price_2 = 3).\n\nI imagine it working using something similar in concept to…widget_data.line_item_mod_1 + widget_data.line_item_mod_2. Perhaps by setting both values to module fields?",
