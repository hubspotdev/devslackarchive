If you want it controlled at the module level, you can add a boolean or choice <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/module-theme-fields-overview|field> to enable choosing which theme, and <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/files#css-classes|use CSS to control which styling is applied>."
