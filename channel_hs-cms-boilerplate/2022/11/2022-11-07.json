    "text": "Hello all, I've been working with the cms-react-boilerplate for the past week or so to write a custom module and have a question about deployments.\n\nWhen I run the local development environment with `yarn start` or use `yarn deploy` to upload my code, it overwrites the files I've published on my page and produces a 404 error for the unminified main.js file effectively breaking my custom module and preventing it from rendering on the page. The only way I find to consistently fix it is to remove the module in the page builder, re-add it, and republish the page. Since the pages are cached, I have to clear my browser cache to see the module render on my site. Some more details have been provided in an issue I opened in the repo here: <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react-boilerplate/issues/53>\n\nMy question is, how do I avoid breaking my custom module while developing? Is anyone else using the react boilerplate and has worked out a workflow for local development and production pushes? Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance!",
