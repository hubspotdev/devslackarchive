How should this be formatted so it pulls in the contacts who is submitting email address so I can properly track analytics?\n If you include an IP Address would it use that and if you don't it would use the server IP Address?\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form>\n\nShould it literally look like this?\n\n\"{\n    \"hutk\": \"60c2ccdfe4892f0fa0593940b12c11aa\",\n    \"ipAddress\": \"192.168.1.12\",\n    \"pageUrl\": \"<http://demo.hubapi.com/contact/>\",\n    \"pageName\": \"Contact Us\",\n    \"redirectUrl\": \"<http://demo.hubapi.com/thank-you/>\"\n}    \"\n\nor\n\n{\n    \"hutk\": \"60c2ccdfe4892f0fa0593940b12c11aa\",\n    \"ipAddress\":\n    \"pageUrl\": \"<http://demo.hubapi.com/contact/>\",\n    \"pageName\": \"Contact Us\",\n    \"redirectUrl\": \"<http://demo.hubapi.com/thank-you/>\"\n}"

Then on your page, you compile a webhook that takes user data (from a form, for example), grab the hutk and ipAddress from the HubSpot cookie, then post the webhook to the API endpoint.",
