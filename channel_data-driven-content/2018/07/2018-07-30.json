I can easily preview the “listing” page, but as soon as I hit a link to a child page, I get a 404, and I don’t find a way to get to its preview directly. Thx!"

When you have the page editor open, open up your network tab in chrome developer tools. Search for a request to `preview.hs-sites` and open that in a new tab. Now that you have a preview page, you can add a the query param `hubdb_row_id=` to the request to preview that page with a specific row",
