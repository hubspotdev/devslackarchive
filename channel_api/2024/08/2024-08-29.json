The webhook is send succesfully but in the Jira automation (whitch catch the webhook) I get a error:\n\n_\"Cannot deserialize value of type `com.codebarrel.automation.api.webhook.IncomingWebhook` from Array value (token `JsonToken.START_ARRAY`) at [Source: REDACTED (`StreamReadFeature.INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION` disabled); line: 1, column: 1]\"_\n\nAccording to a inhouse develeper this is because the body of the webhook message has square brackets at the begin and at the end:\n\n_[{ \"appId\": 3793110, \"eventId\": 100, \"subscriptionId\": 2788570, \"portalId\": 139544566, \"occurredAt\": 1724916669961, \"subscriptionType\": \"deal.propertyChange\", \"attemptNumber\": 0, \"objectId\": 123, \"changeSource\": \"CRM\", \"propertyName\": \"dealstage\", \"propertyValue\": \"sample-value\", \"isSensitive\": false }]_\n\nIf we send the body ourself to Jira (by a thirdpary application) whitout the square brackets we don't get a error:\n\n_{ \"appId\": 3793110, \"eventId\": 100, \"subscriptionId\": 2788570, \"portalId\": 139544566, \"occurredAt\": 1724916669961, \"subscriptionType\": \"deal.propertyChange\", \"attemptNumber\": 0, \"objectId\": 123, \"changeSource\": \"CRM\", \"propertyName\": \"dealstage\", \"propertyValue\": \"sample-value\", \"isSensitive\": false }_\n\nIs there a way we can get rid of these square brackets or if there a other way we can do this action using webhooks?\n\nI hope you guys can help me!\n\nCheers!"

You will need to create a private app on your account with the correct scopes for your API calls, and then obtain a token from the app.\n\nOnce you have this token, you then need to save it as a secret in HubSpot, as this is used to authorize the call you are making. In the code you've provided you would amend process.env.Hapi to whatever the name is of the secret you create - e.g process.env.mynewsecretname.\n\nYou will then need to add an authorization to the headers as well, such as     'Authorization': `Bearer ${mynewsecretname}`\n\nI would recommend reading through some of the API guidance from HubSpot or look up some relevant videos on Youtube to get a better understanding of custom coded actions and interacting with HubSpot via API - as although you can amend someone else's code to your use, you will need to make some changes for it to work on your account :slightly_smiling_face:"

All my string properties come through fine. We've tested passing it as a string and it posts but not actually selecting the values defined, it looks like a string (which shouldn't actually post successfully but let's ignore that for now).\nDoes anyone know how to send multiple values on an enumerated property? Or should I just fall back to a string property and use \"contains\" filters for my reports and list segmentation?\nI'm simultaneously chatting with HubSpot support and will likely get this escalated but maybe someone knows how to handle this."
