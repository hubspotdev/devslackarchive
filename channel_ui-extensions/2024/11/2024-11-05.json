    "text": "Hey, not sure if this is the right forum, but I have a feature/component request.\n\nWould love to have a component called something like `<PropertyInputField property=\"property_internal_name\" objectType=\"deal\" />` which would render the type of input for that property. This one would save alot of time & reduce having to rebuild the same thing for every extension.\n\nThe use case for this would be when you are in a certain context and want to for example prompt the user to enter a property.\n\nIt would just reduce the complexities of implementing owner dropdowns, date pickers, etc. The field does not need to actually update the object itself, but just serve as a helper for the rendering of the field within a form that could use other inputs not tied to properties (Input, Select, NumberInput, DateInput, etc).\n\nThoughts?\n\nThanks! :rocket:",
