    "text": "Not Sure i’ll get many responses as it’s a bit niche, but basically I have 2 HTML fields (type: “html” in the module fields.json)\n\nIn one module the file lets me add a lottie json file that I serve from the theme dev files\n```&lt;lottie-player class=\"lottie-animation\" src=\"{{ get_asset_url('/my-theme-name/js/lottie-files/spinny-dots.json') }}\" background=\"transparent\"  speed=\"1\"  style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%;\"    autoplay&gt;&lt;/lottie-player&gt;```\nIn the other module I have virtually identical code in the html field:\n```&lt;lottie-player class=\"desktop-only\" src=\"{{ get_asset_url('/my-theme-name/js/lottie-files/jumpstart.json') }}\" background=\"transparent\"  speed=\"1\"  style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%;\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid slice\"&gt;&lt;/lottie-player&gt;```\nHowever in when I try to publish the page I get an error for the second one but not the first one. The error says hubl isn’t allowed in the HTML field although it works perfectly well in the first one, and works when I preview the page.\n\nThe main reason I want to serve it from the theme is that it get’s gzipped for page speed performance.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas?",
