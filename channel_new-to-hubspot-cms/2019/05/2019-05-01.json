In my new role, I'm tasked to optimize the company's current integration between HubSpot, Salesforce and other Marketing tools/activities. Does anyone have a good resource for understanding the ins and outs of the integration.\n\nOne example is how to upload bulk list acquisitions into HubSpot that get pushed into SFDC with the correct status. I was told HubSpot pushes contacts into SFDC as responded (which it shouldn't be). Any help would be awesome! Excited to be part of this community :slightly_smiling_face:",
