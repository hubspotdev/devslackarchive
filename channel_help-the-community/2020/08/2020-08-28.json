    "text": "Hi,\n\nI have a question about forms that were not created via Hutspot (see <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/forms/use-non-HubSpot-forms>). We embed some forms on our website using a native HTML5-&lt;template&gt; tag and load them into an overlay after a click on a button via JavaScript. We have found that HubSpot has problems with this approach and does not automatically recognize the form entries in the backend. On the above mentioned help page we read that it is important that the forms are present in the code after loading (which they are, just in a &lt;template&gt; tag).\n\nHas anyone experiences with that approach?"
