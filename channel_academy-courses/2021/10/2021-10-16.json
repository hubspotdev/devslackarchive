    "text": "Hi everyone, I'm working on the CMS Developers practicum and I can't get the drag and drop to work as it does on the gif, I can't get it to resize the content, can't even resize the columns, I've watched the tutorial video again, checked the documentation and I can't get it to work. I've seen an HubSpot video on the Youtube channel, saying that I have to use the boilerplate base.html layout and the boilerplate css files to get it working, but I've tried with everything linked and it didn't work. I'm lost.",
