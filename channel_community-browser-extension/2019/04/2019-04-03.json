If anyone speaks a different language I’ll need help translating “Open Design Manager” into other languages.\n\nI could use google translate but for all I know it will translate into orcish in that other language. Something like: “expand art boss” or something ridiculous, so any help is appreciated.\n\nTranslator does not need to be a coder at all, just needs to be able to translate the words so they don’t sound dumb in the other language."
