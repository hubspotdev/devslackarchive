    "text": "Hello everyone. Dear developers, I am writing with the same problem, after deploying the project it is impossible to select the theme template.\n\n1. When using the architecture with two folders with separate deployment, i.e. `npm run deploy` &amp; `npm run upload:hubl`\n\n2. With the new approach with one folder `npm run deploy`\nIn this case, deleting the project and uploading it again helps, then the template appears. After the next deployment, everything breaks. And you have to delete everything, the client cannot fill out the page and work on the next template..\n\nImportant note. The template is visible when previewing the theme, but cannot be selected when choosing.\nThe first screen is a preview, the second is choosing a template\n\n*Please reply if you took this error for revision*",
