    "text": "Hey there, progress on CrankShaft is somewhat suspended.\nIt is not obsolete, it would be easy to make it into a theme.\n\nCrankShaft was a project I started before joining HubSpot. For legal reasons I personally have to be careful about contributions I personally make to non-HubSpot owned HubSpot centric projects. In short, my contributions can be perceived as if based on insider information, which can result in people buying/selling stock, putting me at legal risk.\n\nCrankShaft and the boilerplate theme, somewhat solve for 2 different audiences of developers. One does not make the other obsolete.\n\nI honestly believe having both CrankShaft and the boilerplate theme be successful would be amazing for our CMS developer community. The boilerplate can and has learned from CrankShaft, and CrankShaft can learn from the boilerplate. Resulting in a better experience for everyone.\n\nAlso to clarify, progress on CrankShaft is only suspended because it needs someone to lead the charge on it. My ability to do so is somewhat limited. I would be very excited for someone to take up the charge and keep it moving."
