    "text": "<@U0695UMTM2M> so i was going to use it for multiple checkbox field (custom property) with countries-&gt; where a user chooses X Country/ies and then the contact information from our representative from this country is then sent in an email\n\nIf you need an example just take the first 10 options from the industry dropdown from the company.\n\nI really just need the code logic behind this bc everything after that is pretty easy to do.\nI am thinking something like having every contact info for every option in one single text property stored and to then have the code check for which field checkbox was checked and then fill up another CustomProperty lets call it \"Sum of Contact info\" with the information of the choices that had been checked.\n\nThe only problem really that i need to solve via code is the branching issue so yea"
