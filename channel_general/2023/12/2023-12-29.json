    "text": "Hi everyone! Hope you guys are doing well. I have a question related to the Mailchimp and HubSpot integration. Currently on my account this is setup in such a way that whenever a contact is updated on HubSpot it also updates the values on Mailchimp. This part works fine - however there are cases when - The particular contact does not exist on mailchimp or is deleted on mailchimp or has to resubscribe to get back on mailchimp. And all of these contacts which DO NOT sync show up in the error log (failing). Is there a way I can clear this log or how can I handle these errors?",

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.
