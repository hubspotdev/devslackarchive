    "text": "*ERROR with older themes (most installed in 2021)* - I don't know if this is only impacting marketplace themes or if it could impact custom themes that are using a child theme.\n\nA soft deletion process on the HubSpot server is causing parent files (like fields.json and templates) to be deleted.\n\nWe have now had 9 customer sites go down completely, this started happening on SEP 1 and we have escalated with HubSpot to get the sites restored quicker now than the first two.\n\nHas anyone else had an issue where the entire website goes down? The signs are that the \"Theme modules\" are missing in page editor (\"Common modules\" are at the top in the sidebar), an error that the template is missing, the content on the page editor is collapsed and missing all CSS, and/or the website doesn't load at all or parts are missing."
