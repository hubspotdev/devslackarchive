I want to show an Our Favourites post section on the main blog landing page but if the topics filter is used I no longer want to show the Our Favourites section and just want to show the filtered topic posts. Any ideas as to how I can do this?",

But if we do <http://oursite.com/page|oursite.com/page> we get redirected to <http://www.oursite.com|www.oursite.com>.  Is it possible to create a redirect that ONLY add www. at the start of the domain? Or there is some kind of workaround in HubSpot? Thanks!",
