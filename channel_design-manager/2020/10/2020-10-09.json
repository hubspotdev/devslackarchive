    "text": "I’m stumped at what’s going on. I have a module with a boolean field that shows or hides content in . The module preview works as expected, and previewing the landing page with the Preview button shows the proper behavior. However, when I make a change with the form fields on the left, the Preview on the right doesn’t always update. Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn’t. Is there a click event that I could listen for to trigger a reload of the Preview panel on the right?"
