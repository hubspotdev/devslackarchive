    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe've designed CTAs to appear on our blog pages. Simple banners with buttons to break up the content and direct users to our main offerings. We designed versions for both desktop and mobile.\n\nI've built these as 'embedded CTAs'. My issues is that I can't see a way to hide the desktop version on mobile and vice versa.\n\nI spoke with HubSpot support and they said it would need to be custom coded. I'm hoping that there's a line of code that can be added to the CTA to state 'show only on desktop / mobile' but don't know if that's possible\n\nDoes anyone know if this is possible and what the code should be?",
