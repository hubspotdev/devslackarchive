And the api returns that extra span tag, which is currently printing out as plain text. So as the easy solution, I was hoping there was a parameter I could set in the API request to suppress that span tag from getting inserted. Otherwise I’ll have to either regex that out with javascript, or set up that card to accept it, sanitize it and insert it via dangerously set html."
