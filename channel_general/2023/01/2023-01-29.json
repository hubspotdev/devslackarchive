The template is totally empty whereas it should display some default modules with dummy content.\n It happens with all the templates I tried, and it has never happened before. I don’t think the client has made any changes (same happens on staging and the client does not have access to staging). I checked the source code and the `{% dnd_area \"body_dnd_area\" %}` is still there, with default content and everything.\nDid I miss an update or something? Does anyone knows why it stopped working suddenly?\nCheers",
