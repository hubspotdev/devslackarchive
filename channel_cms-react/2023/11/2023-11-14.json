    "text": "Hello Byron, thank you for the answer, I think this is a good solution for the case where the module is consumed directly in a template, that is, the props are passed manually, but how would it apply to cases where the module is used in isolation, that is, drag to a dnd_area for example, in that case you can’t pass a prop to it. I guess I should apply a fetch, right? That is, you select the blog you want to target and make a call to obtain the title?"
