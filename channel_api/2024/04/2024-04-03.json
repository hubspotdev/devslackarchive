To understand which user is purchasing the quoted line item, are you hoping to capture their information at the time of purchase?\n3. What Hubs/tiers are you using?\n4. Are you using the built-in quotes logic associated with Deals?\n5. Is it safe to assume that the purchaser of the line items are all the same person?

When a member of the workteam makes a purchase, are you adding line items to the same deal?\n\nIf so, the solution seems straightforward:\n1. Create a custom field on the ‘product’ object to store the name of the purchaser on an individual line item.\n2. When a purchase is made and a line item is added to the deal, update the custom field with the unique variable that allows you to associate the user with a contact record in HubSpot.\nFrom there, you can use whatever logic you’d like to work with the information.",
