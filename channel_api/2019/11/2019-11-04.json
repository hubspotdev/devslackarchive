    "text": "*custom timeline objects and reports*\nThis probably has been asked already.  But is there a way to create reports from timeline events.  I am pushing in a timeline event that is attached to a contact and I want to run reports using the event data.  I did not see that this was an option when creating the reports.  I thought I can maybe create custom fields on the contact which do show in the report as options, BUT it does not look like the API will allow mapping timeline data to custom contact fields.  Has anyone solved for this or have ideas?"
