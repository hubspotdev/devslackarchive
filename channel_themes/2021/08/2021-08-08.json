We just added a new one. \nYou mean \"adding new fields\" on fields.json file also break the settings?\nWould you like to see the new fields.json and old version via personal message?\n\n&gt; If you delete the fields.json in your child theme, the parent theme’s fields.json should be what’s used.\n• It does not work like this, If you add a \"extends\" code into theme.json file with old method on your child theme, *You have to fill the fields.json file. If you do not,* you cannot access any theme settings from editor tool.\n"
