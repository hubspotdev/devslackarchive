This would be useful to build semantic sections put together by multiple modules.\n3. Do you plan on adding the ability to add IDs/classes to rows, columns, or sections?",

Mentioning him here to be sure that we’re talking about it collectively.\n3. This is still a big question mark in our minds. While the functionality would absolutely benefit some of our users, we have to look out for unintended negative effects for our users who aren’t as code-savvy. All the same, I appreciate you bringing it up.\nApologies that I don’t have super solid answers for you. But please know that we do take this feedback very seriously, and are talking about all of these issues extensively in our own channels."
