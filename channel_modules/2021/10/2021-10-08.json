Maybe I’m missing something here, but both solutions don’t appear to be dynamic and look like they require calling upon a very specific blog ID in order to propagate the posts. Given this is going to being global sidebar to many posts, I need to make this module dynamic.\n\nThis is what I have so far for the sidebar module. _(Attached is an image of what I’m attempting to achieve. Sidebar module is in the red box)_\n```&lt;!-- Display the tag name of the current post --&gt;\n&lt;h5&gt;Other {{ tag.name }} FAQs&lt;/h5&gt;\n\n  &lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Looks for posts that have the same tag as the current post and displays the 5 most recent --&gt;\n    {% set related_blog_posts limit=5 %}\n    {% for tag_post in blog_recent_tag_posts %}\n      &lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;!-- Posts the title of related posts --&gt;\n          &lt;a href=\"{{ content.absolute_url }}\"&gt;{{ content.name }}&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n    {% endfor %}\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n &lt;!-- Link to Archive of Posts that Match the Current Posts Tag --&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"{{ current_post__tag_url }}\"&gt;See More&lt;/a&gt;```",

    "text": "Hi HubSpot Fam,\n\nI noticed the hubdbrow field doesn’t permanently display the selected option. It shows up after selecting but defaults to ‘Table Row 1’..‘Table Row 2’..etc after refreshing . Is this a known bug or is there an additional configuration to make it permanently display? It’s a bit of a nuisance to click on the field to know what was selected.\n\n\n<@U01GDKHFCV6> <@U01TWUG4HJ4> <@U01SVUR9M9D>",
