In the case (screenshot) I am trying to add an additional feature to this content grid module so that it allows me to hide it entirely in the mobile or tablet display. However, after implementing some certain codes and settings in the right tool bar. Apparently, the whole module is crashed completely.\n\nAnyone could kindly help me figure out the reason and provide the solution to realize the function?\n\nThank you in advance!",
