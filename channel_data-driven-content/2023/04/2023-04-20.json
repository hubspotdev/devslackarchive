Not sure if it's right channel, but once it is about passing the data I will try here.\nI have coded a page with Open Role when job candidates can leave their CVs as uploaded file <https://www.ziflow.com/open-role>\nEverything works fine on HubSpot end.\nI want to have <http://make.com|make.com> (formerly integromat) integration that will allow me to pass this CV file to certain email address (not as a link, this has to be sent as an attachment - to Linkedin HR portal to be strict, so example email I am sending it to can be <mailto:whatever@linkedinrecruitment.com|whatever@linkedinrecruitment.com> )\nThe problem is that due to this file being permission restricted it is impossible for <http://make.com|make.com> to download it in HTTP request.\nDoes any of you bumped into similar problem? Is there a workaround to pass files somewhere uploaded in HubSpot Forms?\nI want to simply pass this uploaded CV as an attachment to another email address.",
