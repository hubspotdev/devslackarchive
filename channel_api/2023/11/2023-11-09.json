    "text": "Hello! So the prerequisite to my questions is this: I'm currently tracking form submissions to another analytics tool by using the method of listening to global events (window.addEventListener('message', event =&gt; {\n  if(event.data.type === 'hsFormCallback' &amp;&amp; event.data.eventName === 'onFormSubmitted') { etc ). This code is deployed on the pages with forms and the forms are embedded in iframes. But this solution seems to working on some forms and not working on some other forms, and I don't know why, do you have any clue what might be the reason to this? The site that the addEventListener-code is deployed on is not a HubSpot-website (it's a wordpress-site) and I'm not using the data-reach-id that has been removed."
