    "text": "Hi everyone, I am working on an app which needs to manipulate HubDB (specifically, creating tables and add rows). <http://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tools/hubdb> mentions that POST and PUT requests are available, but when I send requests I always get permission error and it shows that I need  `hubdb-access` permission, even if I supplied an OAuth access token with all scopes in the documentation. Anyone has idea on this? Thanks. :slightly_smiling_face:"
