    "text": "<@U04N6N424MB> is this still an issue for you?\n\nI'm getting network errors as well. But, as you said, something weird is going on beyond those errors.\nI tested a deal workflow that uses a custom coded action and when I test the custom coded step, it doesn't work correctly. It doesn't produce a network error, but it seems to be running a previous version of the code (at least I think that's what it's doing). However, when I enroll the deal in the entire workflow, the workflow runs as expected. So it seems to be something specific to testing the code."
