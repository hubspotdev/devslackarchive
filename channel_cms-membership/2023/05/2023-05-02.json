But, some alternatives:\n\n You can enable them to use their <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/memberships#sso-for-memberships|Google or social logins off-the-bat w/o a password instead>.\n\nYou can also set up an <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/features/memberships/sso|SSO schema> and generate an SSO login for those on the list; you can provide the generated sso login information in a workflow or follow-up (or through whatever means) after the person registers.\n\nWith Okta, for example, using their <https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/|Users API endpoint> + our Forms endpoint (if they're registering via form), you can take info from our Form API and upload them as users with the Okta API. This would require it to be a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/serverless-functions|serverless functio>n but could automate the process"
