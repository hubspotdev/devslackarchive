I would like to make some custom modules from scratch and then a custom template from them. I want to be able to use some third party libraries like vue.js to make the the user interface really dynamic and cool (new to Vue.js too lol). However, I do not want to embed the CDN in each module. Is there a way for me to just import the Vue.js source code (or other third party libraries) for the entire template once and then use it in all the different modules I create for it?"
