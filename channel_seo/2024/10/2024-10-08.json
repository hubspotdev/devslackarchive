    "text": "Hi <@U07K4UEB9L5> you'll want to rebuild your website on HubSpot first, before connecting your domain. You won't be able to connect your domain to both, once you point your DNS to HubSpot it would take the Wix site offline.\n\nYour on page SEO shouldn't have any issue as long as you migrate all of the content and pages. If you plan on archiving content, you might see a drop, but submitting your new sitemap to Google Search Console will make sure everything is indexed properly. Make sure to do that after you import your redirects to HubSpot and add any new ones needed."
