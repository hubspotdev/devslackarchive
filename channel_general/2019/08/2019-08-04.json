If they’re just basic forms, then building a simple plugin might work, but then again it might be easier then to just recreate the forms using HS drag-drop.  Having said that, a GF export to HS would be a nice utility!"

I know I can swap it out with a text module but I’ve committed too much time in finding it and I simply need to know for sake of knowing!  (It’s not pulling from Settings/Marketing/Email/Configuration-Footer as that’s for email footers)"
