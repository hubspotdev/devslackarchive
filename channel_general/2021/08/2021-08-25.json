Using the API to do all of the heavy lifting would make building 1000 pages much faster than doing it by hand. Especially if you have a small team. But You would def need to clean up the page data - if it’s coming from wordpress it will be challenging to get the original page data the way you want it."

As others have noted, the content can be tricky to import so it might help to have some kind of manual process for it.\n\ncc <@UHM5BT6G5>"
