It is providing a \"hs-menu-flow-horizontal\" and \"default_horizontal_menu_\" rather than the \"hs-breadcrumb-menu\" and \"hs-breadcrumb-menu-wrapper\". I have a working page with the appropriate breadcrumb functionality but I can't recreate it. Can anyone provide a solution to help?",

Why is that?\nI can see the default value for the reusable fields in the preview of the custom module, but I cannot change the field value in a template level. There isn't a menu under the default content."
