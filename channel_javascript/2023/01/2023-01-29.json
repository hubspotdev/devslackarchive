I'm trying to auto-play a video when a user opens a micromodal but I can't figure out how get it to play\n```    try {\n      MicroModal.init({\n        onShow: function(modal) {\n            video.postMessageToPlayer(\"SET_PLAYER_STATUS\", {\n              status: \"PLAYING\"\n            })\n... etc etc```\nThe iframe is status remains set at 'INITIAL' until the modal opens for the first time, so I know there's something watching for the iframe to become visible, but I can't figure out how to access that and would rather avoid doing something hacky like a setTimeout",
