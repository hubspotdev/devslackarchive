    "text": "HI! question: I have a base dnd template that I use for all the pages on the site I am working on. When we built all the pages we had a global header used for everything. The design got updated and certain pages need to use a different (also global) header. I would like to try and put an option on the template at the page level to select which header I want to use for that specific page. That way I don't have to create a second template and edit all the pages to use a new template. I'm not sure if it is even possible to do that but if so can anyone point me in the right direction?",
