    "text": "Hello everyone! I'm having a problem with the HubSpot API as of today, as it won't allow me to link my HubSpot account to my app and it keeps loading without giving a response. It seems that the problem is in the function api_client.auth.oauth.tokens_api.create_token(), because I receive the code in the URL but when it has to create the token it never creates it and throws an 'EXPIRED_AUTH_CODE' error. I have not made any changes to the code and yesterday everything worked perfectly. I have checked that the HubSpot servers are up and running and they are. Any help or someone who is experiencing the same?"
