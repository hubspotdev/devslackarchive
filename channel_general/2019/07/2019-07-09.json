I've read that HubSpot automatically makes a .min.css file but when I use SEMrush in my website I get a lot of warnings coming from my CSS file. I also tried to minify the file myself but that CSS also contains some hubL code and it doesn't work because of that. Am I missing something or just because of the hubL code I cannot make this file .min?",
