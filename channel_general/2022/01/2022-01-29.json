    "text": "You have roughly 48 hours till the deadline. It will be extremely tough to start now and get an entry in. As far knowledge, you will need to know and be able to use HTML, CSS, JS, and HubL. Experience with HubSpot in general, as well as their design manager, and optionally their CLI tool (in which case you at least need to be able to install Node.js) are big bonuses. Design, UX/UI, and SEO experience are good things to have as well. You will also need to be pretty good at searching out information as you'll likely be spending a good amount of time searching through and reading HubSpotâ€™s docs. Good luck if you decide to try to enter."
