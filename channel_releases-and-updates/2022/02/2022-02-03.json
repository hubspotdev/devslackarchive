    "text": "<@U3T21PDBK> just chatted with the team about this. We'll get that number cutoff issue fixed up--you'll hopefully see that come through to production in a couple days.\n\nRegarding the opacified number value. I think what we're going to do is add a placeholder \"0\" by default and opacify that 50%. We're also considering giving devs the ability to add their own placeholders like, \"add width here\" or whatever. Curious your thoughts on that. Something we're discussing internally and if no one sees any red flags with that, we'll go ahead and make that happen.\n\nRegarding adding a stepper, we can definitely look into that--that one may be a longer term thing we look into though, just to set expectations."
