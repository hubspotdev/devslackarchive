    "text": "Happy to help provide some insight to your issues:\n\n1 - template X changes will only reflect on website Y _IF_ the module that you've changed has not been modified at the page level. Once a template has been changed with content on the page, the template changes don't overwrite the page.\n\nTo change content on website Y, you would need to manually make the updates to the page.\n\n2 - this is likely due to server cache, especially since the changes are visible after changing the URL (creating a new cache).\n\nYou can add ?hsCacheBuster=3167 (using a random number each time) to the URL to bipass the server cache and verify your changes.\n\nI recommend the \"unofficial\" HubSpot dev extension for chrome, it has a button to bust the cache and other helpful tools.\n\n<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/HubSpot-developer-extensi/gebemkdecnlgbcanplbgdpcffpdnfdfo?hl=en>"
