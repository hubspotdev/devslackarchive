I dont’ want to use &lt;img src=“path/to/svg/file.svg” because i’d like to change color, stroke, etc with css.\n\nSo i want to use the full svg code in the html code.. i was thinking of creating a hubdb table, make a macro of it with its name as a variable so its easy to use. Thinking out loud here. please let me know what you guys would do/have done to make this work!",

Created a Hubdb for Products, this have columns such as the Product name, product category, product sub category, and other details.\n2. Created normal pages for product subcategory and attached the hubdb. This way I achieved the\nproduct-category/product-subcategory/product-name URL\n\nThe issue:\nThis approach created each rows a dynamic pages on each normal pages that uses the same HubDB. A major redundacy and issues on SEO part.\n\nCan someone please help me on this.",

Seems like an awful lot of work for no gain for anyone. This doesn’t affect SEO like it once did, and why have an overly long URL? Create breadcrumbs on your pages if you want to show this type of hierarchy — I see zero value of creating a complex url structure.\n\nIf I were doing this, I’d use dynamic pages, I’d set this up as products/product-slug, and have breadcrumbs. I realize I don’t have all of the project requirements in here, that is why I offer option 1 and 2"
