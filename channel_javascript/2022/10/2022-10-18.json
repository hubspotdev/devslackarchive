Can anyone point me in the right direction for being able to populate custom properties on my contacts list? Right now I'm only getting email, name, and phone number properties updated when user signs up. This is the code\n`setIdentity({\n      email: data.email,\n      name: `${data.firstName} ${data.lastName}`,\n      user_type: \"artist\",\n      referred_by: data.referralCode,\n    });`\nWould appreciate if anyone has tips!
