    "text": "Hey <@U7QHZR9DZ> not a difference any more. the automation in the settings area is really just a short cut, think about it as a blue print for what most people with e-commerce systems would want.  THere is not functional difference between the two.  For some historical context, there used to be a difference where you could access limited Deal type workflows without having Sales Hub just in the settings area of ecommerce bridge.  We’ve since expended the functionality of embedded workflows (the name for what’s in the settings) and now require any kind of Deal workflows to need Sales Hub.",
