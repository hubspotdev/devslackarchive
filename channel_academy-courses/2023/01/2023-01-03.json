    "text": "The node_modules folder will only appear if you’ve installed node packages locally (not using the `-g` flag) to that project. If you haven’t installed any project-specific node resources, you shouldn’t expect a node_modules folder. :)\n\nFor example, you shouldn’t expect to see anything show up in your project file when you run `npm install -g @HubSpot/cli`, since that’s installing the CLI globally.\n\nIf you don’t seem to be running into any problems, you’re probably fine to carry on for now! However, I would pretty strongly recommend looking into other learning resources that can help to familiarize you with Node and NPM — they’re hugely important fixtures in the landscape of modern web development, and this definitely won’t be the only time you run into them as you learn.\n\nGood luck with your cert! :)"
