    "text": "Hey <!here|@here>, remember when I said that HubDB APIs could change anytime? Well, that time has come. I'm making a change to how you access columns. Instead of using `row.get(&lt;columnId&gt;)` or `row.col('&lt;columnName&gt;')` you'll access them as any other HubL dict. \n\n`row.&lt;columnName&gt;` or `row['&lt;columnName&gt;']` or `row[&lt;columnId&gt;]`\n\nThis will mean changing your pages, but I think the new API is more consistent and cleaner. The change isn't live now, but should be out by Monday."
