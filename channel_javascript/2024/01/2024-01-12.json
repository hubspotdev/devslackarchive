    "text": "I everybody :grinning:, i have a question about non-HubSpot forms.\n\n*Case description :*\nMy client have 2 differents HubSpot CRM platforms. We can rename *CRM1* and *CRM2*.\nI developped a simple solution who lead the choice to users if they want to fill CRM1 form or CRM2 form.\nThat two forms have been *manually created* and are HubSpot one.\nIn the aim to display that solution i used Google Tag Manager ( Custom HTML bloc ), insertion into all website pages.\nInto that website, we have others small HubSpot forms needs to be collected.\n\n*Live result :*\n• When i fill *CRM1* form :\n    ◦ lead creation into *CRM1* :white_check_mark:\n    ◦ new submission into the correct *CRM1* form :white_check_mark:\n    ◦ nothing into *CRM2* :white_check_mark:\n• When i fill *CRM2* form :\n    ◦ lead creation into *CRM2* :white_check_mark:\n    ◦ new submission into the correct *CRM2* form :white_check_mark:\n    ◦ copy a new form into *CRM1* as external form ( ex : *#hsForm_326fd8a2-9a......* ) :red_circle:\n    ◦ copy of a contact into *CRM1* :red_circle:\nI searched many solutions to avoid that unwanted information copy into *CRM1*\n\n*I founded 3 main options :*\n• Use a trick / add that script before HubSpot launch collectedForms script : &lt;script id=\"CollectedForms-XXXX\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;, Then it works well, no copy into CRM1 and lead / contact OK. But needs to add into each wordpress pages...\n• Desactivate : \"Collect data from website forms\" from HubSpot settings ( means no data from all externals forms )\n• Use Zappier to create correct lead into correct CRM\n*Finally what i want :*\n• Receive a lead and contact in the correct CRM everytime a user submit each forms.\n• Don't block any contact form submission ( i want to receive all forms data from all forms )\n• Don't break any form from the website ( HubSpot or wordpress )\nThank you very much to advice me..",
