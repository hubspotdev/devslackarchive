The thing is that the code works. On the <http://babelbot.app|babelbot.app> site, it works on <https://www.babelbot.app/fr/calculatortest> , but doesn't on <https://www.babelbot.app/fr/>.  It works if I put it on <https://www.babelbot.app/fr/help/getting-started>, but not if I put it on <https://www.babelbot.app/fr/help>.  My hunch is that its conflicting with something else on the page and when I call `i18n_getmessage`, it's not looking at the correct place for language files.\n\nI emailed the support for the Theme we are using as well."
