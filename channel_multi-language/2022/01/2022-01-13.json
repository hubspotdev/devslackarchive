    "text": "Hi,\nI have another question regarding this ticket, see the attached screenshot, see the highlighted section. Does HubSpot add this automatically as well when we’ve multiple languages because above that section there’s also the same segment of code which I think is the one which HubSpot adds automatically (if we’re having multiple languages). When I check *Settings &gt; Website &gt; Blog* or *Settings &gt; Website &gt; Page*, I found nothing in Header HTML section.\nCan you help me get rid of those extra hreflang tags causing the conflict?\nThank you",
