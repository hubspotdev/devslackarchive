I’ve tried post_filter but with that I can’t filter the content by _both_ the topic and the author, just one or the other. Unless I’m missing something. My next step is to look at using the API, but I feel like there should be an easier way to do this since it’s all within the same HubSpot blog. Any thoughts?"
