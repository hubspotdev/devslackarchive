    "text": "Hi guys,\nNoticed, that if you add a `module`, it will be shown only in the `all` category on the editor. Is there a way to have it in the theme modules section as well? I’m guessing that’s based on the directory structure of the theme folder and the react modules are not there (inside projects). So prob it should also look the `@projects/{project}/{app}/components/modules` folder as well.",
