It seems to be directly related to the `request_contact.is_logged_in` HubL variable and how it detects cookie-changes (assuming it is reading from cookies).\n\nThe `__hsmem` cookie is removed as soon as the logout action is called and you have navigated to `/_hcms/mem/logout` but, for whatever reason, a page refresh is still required for any HubL conditionally-rendered content to be updated... which is not ideal, to say the least.\n\nWould be good to get some further assistance from HubSpot on this one or, to shed some light on if we're doing something drastically incorrect :sweat_smile:",
