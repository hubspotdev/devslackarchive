Thanks!\n\n> Is the sample above being used in the middle pane?\nYes\n\n> Is the ButtonRow nested within any other components?\nYes\n```<Flex direction=\"row\">\n    <Box flex={2}>\n        <Flex direction=\"column\" gap=\"xs\">\n            <>\n                ...\n                <ButtonRow\n\t\t\t\t\tdropDownButtonOptions={{ size: 'small', variant: 'secondary' }}\n\t\t\t\t>```\nI believe the blue container is the Flex parent.\n\n> How many Buttons are contained within the ButtonRow?\nFirst screenshot, three. About the same size as the “Backoffice” one.\nSecond screenshot - just one."
