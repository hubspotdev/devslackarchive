    "text": "We use Bitbucket Pipelines with deployment variables (staging and production) for the API keys and portal ID and have `development` branch autodeploying to sandbox account and `master` branch deploy to production with manual trigger (ie. need to push the button in the UI).\n\nThe pipeline installs dependencies, builds the project with weback, generates the HubSpot config file and uploads the built files. This works really well when there are no problems.\n\nDefault pipeline which is run for every feature branch on every commit runs tests and linters, and also builds just to verify it passes.\n\nEarlier this week when the file upload didn't work properly for a while `hs` command returned success exit code even if there were errors uploading the files. This should be changed, took two days to notice the problems because the builds passed.\n\nThe one thing we really miss is to have actual production content on the staging portal for pre-release testing and verification."
