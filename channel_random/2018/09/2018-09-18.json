We're currently in the process of switching our PM software, which I'm hoping will help, and one of our requirements is an open API so I can write custom extensions for this kind of thing. We tried the built-in HS PM tools a long time ago and didn't find them robust enough for our processes. Would also be interested if anyone has a simple solution"

We actually now have ourselves as a client in JIRA and make sure to plan our agency-specific cards as part of our team’s capacity that way we’re sort of forced to complete those cards.
