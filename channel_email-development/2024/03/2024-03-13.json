    "text": "Hey all, I’m exploring options for sending emails with attachments (for my use case, it is an ics file) using HubSpot’s transactional email feature. However, after my research, I’ve found that direct attachment support <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Attachments-for-transactional-emails/idi-p/487720|might not be available>. One alternative is utilizing the SMTP API, which allows sending attachments but doesn’t integrate with HubSpot templates directly.\nThese are the possible options I have explored -\n1. I’ve discovered a <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Sending-transactional-emails-programmatically-with-attachments/m-p/524690|workaround> to use templates in HubSpot but requiring manual code changes whenever a template is updated. This solution works but introduces maintenance overhead.\n2. Investigated the template API, I didn’t find a suitable solution either.\n3. Use the files API to add the attachment into the file manager and then adding a link to the email. This solution also works but I ’m getting a little resistance from the team as it is not convenient for the user as they would have to click a button/link to download the attachment but it won’t be added automatically to their calendar.\n\nI’m curious if you’re aware of any better solutions that I might not know about? Thanks for your help in advance!"
