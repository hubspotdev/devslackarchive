    "text": "Hey everyone,\nI have a question regarding the SMS add-on and workflows. While it's possible to send a personalized SMS to a contact from their contact owner using tokens like the contact's name and a meeting link, I'm wondering if there's a way to build a workflow triggered by SMS replies.\nIdeally, Iâ€™d like to set up a workflow where, if a contact replies to a text message, it triggers an automated email to the contact owner with a personalized message, such as:\n\"Hey [Contact Owner], [Contact Name] just replied to your text message: '[Text Body].'\"\nHas anyone worked on something similar or know if this is achievable?\nThanks in advance for your help!",
