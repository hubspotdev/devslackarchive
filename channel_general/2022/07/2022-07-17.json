I’m seeing various issues with email responses not always being received by contacts.\n\nI’d like to be able to trigger an inline form response with a link to the document on the page as well but with some security measures so to speak.\n\n1. the download document is *not* rendered in the website code inspector, either in view source code or devtools\n2. the download link is returned in a Fetch/XHR request url\n3. the Fetch/XHR request url has some checks to validate that the request was made from a form submission - something like a csrf token\nFor bonus points I’d like to avoid using jQuery\n\nThanks\n\n\n<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/advanced_form_options>"
