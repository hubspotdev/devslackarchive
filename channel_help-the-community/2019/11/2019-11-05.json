    "text": "Hi <@UEFM5P9PV>! I'm Amanda and I'm a technical consultant at HubSpot. Right now, there isn't a way to get two separate calls to the forms API to \"stack\" into one submission. The best alternative would be to either 1) not submit the form the first time but store the data, then submit everything in one call when the second form is submitted. or 2) make two submissions to the forms API to two separate forms. These will update the same contact and the corresponding contact properties as long as both submissions include either the same HubSpot usertoken or the same email address, but it will log as two form submissions on thee contact record"
