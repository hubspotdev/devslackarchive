They really should be using some phone number libraries to validate and store in the format for each country so that you know the format inside when doing searches or using them for VOIP, etc."

The `filters` and `filtergroups` options I suggested can be used on any properties, including custom ones.\n\nThat said, I agree with <@U012W4YEUTX> that phone numbers aren't well normalized; and extra or missing dash or parenthesis will prevent a match.  I guess you could normalize all your phone numbers yourself as soon as the records get created, if searching by phone is really critical to you.  It's a shame that HubSpot doesn't do this for you under the hood, although I see a lot of bogus numbers entered <tel:(123-456-7890|(123-456-7890> for example) so I can see why it wouldn't be a priority."
