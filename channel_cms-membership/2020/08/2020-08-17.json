    "text": "Good morning\n\nI have a question around security behind memberships and Hubdb.\n\nWhile pages can be set to private, and only contacts of a specified list can access certain gated content. If Hubdb tables are used within the gated content, which contain, for example video URLs, would the Hubdb data be publicly accessible?\n\nCould an external AJAX request made on those URLs outside of the gated content still work? Or will the Hubdb that is publish but behind the gated content be protected?\n\nIf we set the table permissions to private: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/features/hubdb|Article> (HubSpot Knowledge base ref)\nWill this only be accessible by members?",
