    "text": "Hey there, thank you for creating an idea forum post for this. This is something we’ve thought about and know would be useful. A reason this has been a bit slow to be implemented is that other tools provide an open text box for classes but it requires you to know what the available classes are, and when and when not to use them.\n\nFor developers that may feel trivial, but once this feature is implemented it’s hard for us to create a better  UI/UX for the later without negatively impacting any sites that implemented the old “class” field.\n\nFolks should continue upvoting the forum thread as it helps our teams to prioritize the work they do based on demand."
