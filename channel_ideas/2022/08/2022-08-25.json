    "text": "Pretty much was our thinking behind it. Opening up conditional hubl inside of dnd areas makes things weird / harder to reason about. We'd have to provide the additional context that drives the conditions _some how_. (field prompts at insert time for \"developer sections\", support for macros from the template context, etc).\n\nI think it's a bunch more complexity for something we haven't really heard there was a need for. \"Sections\" was a means by which we at least tried to make fragments of a layout reusable. We may be revisiting \"sections\" next year to add some new functionality and we can try to keep this use case in mind though."
