I say this because I just created more than 10 new properties for a free account.\n\nCan anyone confirm if there is any limitation on creating properties via api (lets say contact properties)?"

Here’s our Install URL (client id + re-direct-uri are hidden for security purposes).\n\n`<https://app-xyz.HubSpot.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=>&lt;client-id&gt;&amp;redirect_uri=&lt;re-direct-uri&gt;&amp;scope=contacts%20oauth%20crm.import`\n\nThe ideal flow of events are as follows:\n1. HubSpot Super admin creates a user who has just access to contacts and import permissions\n2. Shares the login credentials with subscribers of our platform who are working with the client (who owns HubSpot) to connect the app to import leads into their HubSpot \nThe problem we’re running into is that, only Super-admin users are able to connect/install the app from our application. For the lower-grade users (our ideal set of users), we’re getting this error “_*Couldn’t complete the connection.* You don’t have permission to connect this app_.”\n\nWe need the API-Only users or something similar to tackle this, I believe. Does HubSpot allow non-Super admins to install apps into their HubSpot instance at all? Any input is appreciated."
