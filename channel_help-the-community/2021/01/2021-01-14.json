    "text": "Hi Everybody, quick question: Is there an API to set the Slack channel for a deal?\nWe have our own project management system, which already offers linking Slack channels to projects and have not connected it to HS, so would like to take the project Slack channel and set this to all HS deals associated with that project. Couldn't find this in the CRM API (was suspecting this could be an Association, maybe?). Thanks for your help."
