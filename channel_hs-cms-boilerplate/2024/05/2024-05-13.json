In that case react makes sense.\n\nAlso if we put a react dev in charge of a project then it’ll also make sense (resource-wise).\n\nBut from my assessment it just seems over-engineered most of the time. HS React modules will probably only replace 2 standard modules in our company codebase.\n\nCurrently we’re making a podcast microsite (kinda like a spotify or yt music clone) and react is the perfect tool for the job… but most b2b sites don’t need it imo"

Using DnD editor to build landing pages and would like to basically `valign=\"top\"` the rich text module within the left column. Doesn't seem like that is an option with the default tools - any ideas for how to make it so the text is at the top of the column rather than in the middle?",
