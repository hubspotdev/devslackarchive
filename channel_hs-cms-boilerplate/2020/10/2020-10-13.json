    "text": "Hi everybody! We launched our new HubSpot CMS website <http://www.made2grow.de|www.made2grow.de> last week. In chrome I got the message that it is creating too many redirects, but Safari and Firefox was fine. For others, such as colleagues, chrome works fine. So, it must be a bug on my end. Probably an extension. I didn’t bother until today because Safari and Firefox are showing me the same error message because of too many redirects. Any idea how to fix this?",
