    "text": "<@U25C65C3S> great idea but not sure as the TY page link could be read from client side if someone knows how to do it. It could be used to manually open ie. /confirmation?success=1 etc. and be recognized as a regular member w/o subscribing. <@U01ASFZL4UA> that might work as well but didn’t try it. Thanks so much guys! \n\nSo, I have managed to get stripe to work instantly with zapier detecting a subscription update and adding that user to a list. And apparently this trigger can be instant. \n\nHere are the steps if anyone else come to slack looking for a solution for stripe integration: :slightly_smiling_face:\n1. Capture all information except card details with HubSpot form\n2. On form submit redirect to checkout page\n3. Zapier to detect new subscription and add that contact to the list\n4. Redirect user to the site, in the meantime email to set a password is sent by HubSpot"
