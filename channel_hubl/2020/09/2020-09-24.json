I.e. a setting in dnd_row, dnd_column etc. Are you simply referring to a display:none css on the module on certain breakpoints?"

But the hubl syntax that enables this to both render the css _and_ show up as a control for the user in the editor is currently in beta if you’d like to join. We are currently _allowing_ one breakpoint whose name is “mobile”, but the actual media query that goes along with it and is displayed in the editor is defined by the developer."
