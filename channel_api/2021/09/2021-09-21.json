How to secure it ?"

To be more specific, I would like to be able to create a custom dashboard for my integration from within HubSpot where you can update things like property mappings or sync settings (see screenshot). I have not found any resources explaining how I might go about this. Is this just not possible for regular HubSpot users or am I missing something?",
