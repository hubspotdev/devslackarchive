    "text": "Hey everyone, I’m using the Forms API on our non-HubSpot registration page. I have custom properties for `utm_campaign`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, etc… that are getting passed into the registration form from the URL. If those parameters are not present in the URL, the values are defaulting to `null`. My `POST` requests are failing, returning a 400 error. I don’t want to pass in empty strings as default values because I’m afraid those empty strings could override previous values captured from prior conversions. Any suggestions on how to go about capturing those parameter values only when they are present in the URL?",
