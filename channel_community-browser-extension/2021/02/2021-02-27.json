    "text": "Hi Saba i sincerely apologize for my slow response. \n\nAs far as I'm aware there is no way to run a VS Code extension within Visual Studio(kind of a humerous oversight if you ask me).\n\nHubSpot itself is not a .net platform. So using Visual Studio instead of a more file based code editor like VS Code. Likely is not going to be as good of an experience.\n\nIf you are not building a site to be run on HubSpot but instead an application that leverages HubSpot's APIs perhaps this open source project would help <https://github.com/HubSpot-net/HubSpot.NET|https://github.com/HubSpot-net/HubSpot.NET>\nThis is acommunity created project and not created and maintained by HubSpot itself"
