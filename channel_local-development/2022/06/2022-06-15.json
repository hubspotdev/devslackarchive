    "text": "Yup, it's more in regards to shared “global” theme elements, like templates and modules. Content staging is great if you just want to change a page-specific piece of code, but for modifying a template or module that's used by other pages/assets, the only real solution I can think of is to clone the template/module, stage a new page, and switch out the module/template with the cloned one— not a great solution. I was hoping maybe someone had something else set up they could share some insight on. Maybe making a separate staging theme and subdomain would be best after all, though I'm still not sure of a good process to handle it other than fetching live to staging to make sure it's up to date, make changes on staging and then push staging theme to live."

I have a core grouping of modules that are pretty style-agnostic, but most other modules do require some kind of styling; the base functionality of each are the same across clients.\n\nFor development, I normally crush the bulk of the work from a Figma design into my dev environment until I see enough momentum to deploy it to the client's sandbox/staging env. Then finally, production. GitHub Actions are powerful tools for CI/CD that keep it all streamlined and clean and match the branches I work from."
