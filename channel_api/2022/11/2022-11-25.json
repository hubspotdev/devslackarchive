But If I try to publish manually from the quotes tool I get a generic error message “Quote cannot be saved” then when I go back in all of the line items have been removed.\n\nIf I just try to publish from the api then the quote amount is correct — The quote will publish but none of the line items will be on it. If I then revert to a draft and edit it. It has no line items. <@U01QVR44MEY> Any thoughts?\n\n*----update----*\n\nCustom line items must be created for both the Quote and the Deal separately. Even if they are the same apparently.\n\n*The new problem is the fact that none of the line items show up on the pdf when published by the API until the quote is manually recalled and republished*\n\n---- update ---\n\nOverall, still not working. However, if my rfq form only adds one line item then the quotes work as expected. If there are more than one line items then, as mentioned, the line items only appear if I manually unpublish and republish the quote.",

And I dont even think I can batch associate them which is odd.\n\nI am making a deal first with the same line items. And If I go into the deal and hit create quote It seems to work fine. I wonder if it has to do with reusing line item Id’s from the association between the line item and the deal for the quote.\n\nI wonder if because they are “custom line items” that they have a one to one association? I wonder if I will need to remake them for the quote."
