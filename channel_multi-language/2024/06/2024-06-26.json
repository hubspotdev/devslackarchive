The primary domain is English, with others being /fr/, /en-gb/ (since we can’t use /eu/), and /jp/\n\nEvery time the client edits a page it’s automatically updating the set language from English to English - United States, which is actually changing the url by appending /en-us/, causing a ton of problems.\n\nThe domain language is set to English, not EN-US, so I know that’s not forcing it.\n\nWhy the heck is this setting getting changed?",
