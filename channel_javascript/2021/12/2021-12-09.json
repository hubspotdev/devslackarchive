I am able to test via console.log that I'm setting the stage correctly for the field to be sent, but no matter what I seem to do, the field remains empty on the contact record. I tried writing it the way you have, without the single-quotes around `input[value=\"feature_1\"]` but that threw an Uncaught ReferenceError at me."
