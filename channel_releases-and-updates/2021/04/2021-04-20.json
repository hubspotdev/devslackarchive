    "text": "<@U2H3TT8F2> Just to share my thoughts:\n\n(1) Would it be a good idea to have something like a ghost tree of the parent theme in the design manager? Without the capability to edit those files. Just to see the file structure. If we customize a parent theme file for the child, the file in the ghost tree gets replaced / overwritten.\n\n(2) How do i work with customizations? I tested to customize a module, but have to replace the template html completely with a child-clone of that template, just to change the path of the module. In the case of a global banner module used by all templates, it become a lot of junk-code. Is there a better way to do that?\n\n(3) Before the option for child-themes i thought about to place an empty custom.css beside my modules and include that by default. So i know i don’t touch the original file for customer adjustments. I guess this is still a good way to separate child-theme adjustments?\n\n(4) By working with the child clone templates there appear a lot of “Using assets outside current theme” errors. And I have a lot of assets using _include_ and _import_ syntax. Like global shared macros, variables and translations across the theme in different files. But currently its unable to use a variable for the _include/import_ HubL path syntax, to provide something like asset_path variable. Is there a solution for that?\n\nRegards"
