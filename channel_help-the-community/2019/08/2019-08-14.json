    "text": "Currently it is not possible to get the chat status from the conversations API. We have status icons on our website showing if our customer services is reachable by chat. Right now I hide the chat if no employees are available and check by a custom script if the chat has loaded on the website, if not, I set the status icons to unavailable. But I really would like to always show the chat and get the current status of the chat through the API.
