    "text": "Has anyone here set up a multi-tenant style structure for a HubDB based dynamic webpage? From what I understand so far on the requirements, there is a HubSpot page built which they are looking to allow partners to whitelabel. This would require a rebranding of certain aspects of the page - specifically logo, it would also require a filtered view of the rows in HubDB which are available to that whitelabel partner and then depending on the partner, the leads would need to then be sent to the correct partner. It would be great to learn from anyone who has successfully implemented something like this to avoid issues. How to set up the hubDB structure, fields that are useful, and how to handle the identification of the partner and the communication going to the correct place - maybe by subdomain"
