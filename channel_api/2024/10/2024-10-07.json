Am I understanding that correctly?* \n\nI can see the content of the email in the `content` property, but the HTML is split up within the `content.widgets` property as multiple modules. Each module has its' own properties (CSS, HTML etc).\n• Is it possible to somehow get all of it as HTML, similar to what I can get when retrieving templates from the \"Get the Template by ID\" endpoint? I.e. GET <https://api.hubapi.com/content/api/v2/templates/:template_id>\n    ◦ This endpoint returns a `source` property with the HTML for that whole template. I'd like to have something like that for marketing emails :slightly_smiling_face: \n"
