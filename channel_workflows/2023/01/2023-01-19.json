This is the owner of a meeting object that is associated with the deal that is enrolled in the workflow. The deal owner is currently unassigned.\n\nI now want to use this HubSpot_owner_id (output from the code block) and copy it to the deal property \"HubSpot_owner_id (a.k.a. Deal owner) that is enrolled in the workflow.\n\nAny idea if this is possible? It doesn't allow me to do it",
