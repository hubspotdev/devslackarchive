    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am not sure if this is the correct channel but here I go:\n\nI wish to import the Form module from the <@UDA553DRD>/cms-components package. This worked fine in another project. I simply installed the needed dependencies via npm. Now in this current project I was going for the same approach. I added the code from the other project as sample code and installed all the needed dependencies beforehand when creating the project. Now I run into an error which is quite odd. The IDE tells me this: \"TS2305: Module \"<@UDA553DRD>/cms-components\" has no exported member Form\". Indeed there are two folders with package.json files. These are the main folder in which dependencies had to be installed and the app folder in which dependencies had to be installed. As a result I received two respective node_modules folder in the respective directories I mentioned. Now in the other project the line is the same: \"import { Form} from '<@UDA553DRD>/cms-components'\"  (don't mind the uppercase letters, it is because of slack). The other project points to a file that lies in the node_modules folder of the main folder. This project seemingly tries to find Form in the node_modules folder that it is in right now. I don't know if and why this is the case however. Does anyone has any clue as to why this happens and how to fix this?\n\nThanks in advance!",
