    "text": "Hi new to HubSpot. Wondered if anyone could answer this question about the HubSpot apps. I want to be able to access the subscriptions via an app but i don't want to make it public to the market place. Can this be done? I see private apps don't have access to subscriptions - can you let me know if I'm wrong?"
