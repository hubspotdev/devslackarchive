I'm trying to send a transactional email through the single send API and I need to set the custom properties to have an array, however my array doesn't have a key for each value, its dynamic and it can have a varying number of elements. Do you have any knowledge how to achieve this or even if this feature is supported?",

See this page for the clients that support custom fonts: <https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-at-font-face/>\n\nGmail (web, android, iOS) do not support &lt;style&gt; in the &lt;body&gt;. They DO support it if you do: `&lt;body&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/body&gt;`. But HubSpot does not support that and will strip away the `&lt;head&gt;` tag. But it doesn’t matter either way because no flavor of Gmail supports custom fonts."
