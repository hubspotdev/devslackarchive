    "text": "We are moving from LiveHelpNow (LHN), to HubSpot's livechat (and bot). LHN doesn't handle the events to send to Google Analytics so I created a dataLayer.push function to fire when the chat started (containing the event, category, action and label) on Google Tag Manager and subsequently linked this to the Google Analytics Goal \"LiveChat\". HubSpot Livechat makes my life easier because it is intuitive and doesn't make me want to gauge my eyes out when I log into it like LHN does. If the livechat initiates its own dataLayer.push then I can get rid of my code that I used for LHN and let HubSpot do its thing and simply create a new goal that will be assigned to HubSpot Live Chat.\n\nAlso, is there a sandbox of sorts I can create because at the moment, everytime I turn on the HubSpot livechat (even on our demo site), it activates on the live site too which means we have 2 chat boxes showing up."
