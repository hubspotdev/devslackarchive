The trouble i'm having is doing both of these at the same time (I can do them both individually):-\n\n• The adjusting columns widths of the image and text columns\n• Setting up this layout with default content in my template\nWhen I set the layout up with default content, the columns no longer appear editable width because i've had to specify the widths in my code."
