    "text": "Can anyone help with a question on customizing the form embed code?  <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/advanced_form_options>\n\nOne of the object params is *redirectUrl*. What I want to do is redirect the form to <http://www.mywebsite.com?email=_input_>    where _input_ is the email address the user enters in the form field. My issue is that hbspt.forms.create() wants the redirectUrl when creating the form, but I don't know the URL until onFormSubmit when I want to take the user's input and append it to the URL as a query string. I see there is an onFormSubmit: function($form), but can't figure out how to use this to assign the redirectUrl appropriately.\n\nWould appreciate if anyone has any suggestions or knows how I might accomplish this."

    "text": "<@UEZ3125LL> yea basic jist redirectURL wont work for what you need easiest way to pull it off is to have a dummy form, submit the HS form through an iframe then use JS to redirect the User to the URL you want.\n\nnot easy, but that’s the easiest method I’ve found"
