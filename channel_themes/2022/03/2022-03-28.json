I am trying to make the majority of the modules in the parent theme unavailable in the child.\n\nTo do that I copied my modules folder and went through the module's meta.json files and set\n`\"is_available_for_new_content\": false`\nbut whenever I create a new page and add content, the modules are still available to the editor.\n\nThe \"Make available in templates and pages\" is also turned off.\n\nHas anyone experienced this or know what I might be doing wrong?",
