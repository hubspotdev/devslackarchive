It would be nice if we could set a short description describing the purpose of the table and any additional notes in there, especially if we have a HubDB table that is being populated automatically through an API endpoint or such. Speaking of which, it would be nice if we had the ability “lock” a table in such a case as well, similar to how we can lock folders in the design manager.",
