    "text": "Hi everyone. I'm working on the CMS for Developers practicum, and I'm having some trouble getting the dnd image section working like it does in the gif. I can get the image to work perfectly if I upload an image via the CMS then select \"automatically adjust\" to the width of the column, so it always takes up the dnd column width even after it is changed in the CMS. I'm trying to set a default image in the template, but when I do that it sets the image width to 200px. Is there a way to set an image module to take up the full width of the `dnd_section` in the template?\n\nI attached a video of what I'm going for, as well as my code and a screenshot of what I'm currently getting. Any help is appreciated!",
