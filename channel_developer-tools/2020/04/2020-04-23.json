    "text": "Hi folks,\nI need some advice on how to develop a quite not-as-usual survey and form.\nWe´re trying to do an online survey (you answer some questions splitted in differente pages, and get your results in the last one, basically like a Typeform, but we´d love to do it in HubSpot CMS).\nWhat we need to figure out is the right way to do this without any third-party app (what´s the best kind of CMS module for this) and get the results automated into a follow-up email that prospects can receive after finishing the test.\nWe´re trying to develop it using css and javascript, basically, but I got the feeling that there´s some another and easy way.\nAny advice would be highly appreciated.\nThanks in advance",
