    "text": "Hello, I’d love to have some guidance on how to use `onCrmPropertiesUpdate`  and `refreshObjectProperties` . Thank you in advance!\n\n*Simplified use case*: I have two properties displaying in a middle pane CRM card in the form of `CrmPropertyList`: `plan_sold` and `plan_included_points` . Plan_sold should be chosen by a user and `plan_included_points` will be set accordingly by a workflow.\n\nWhat I wanted to achieve is that, when a user choses a different `plan_sold` , the display property `plan_included_points`  will be updated accordingly in the CRM card without user needing to refresh the page. However, the code below didn’t seem to achieve it.\n\n`onCrmPropertiesUpdate([\"plan_sold\", \"plan_included_points\"], properties =&gt; {`\n    `console.log(properties);`\n    `setProperties(properties);`\n    `refreshObjectProperties();`\n  `});`\n\nI believe I managed to achieve bi-directional property refresh by following the<https://github.com/HubSpot/ui-extensions-examples/blob/main/bi-directional-property-refresh/src/app/extensions/PropertyRefreshExtension.tsx| example project> - but not the second property that was updated based on the input first property via a workflow.",
