    "text": "Hi, thanks for the response :slightly_smiling_face:  I'm afraid that I meant a different case.\n\nActually, I was wondering if there is any place where you can bind alt tag with an image, not with particular instance of it.\n\nExample:\nYou have an hero image that you use on 20 landing pages of your company. Of course we can fill the _Alt text_ field in the default _Image_ module, but we'll have to copy-paste it in each of 20 instances (and repeat it in case of any ammendment). I expected HubSpot to allow bind alt text with an image in _Files Manager_ but I'm afraid it's not possible. Any chances to do that? :wink:"
