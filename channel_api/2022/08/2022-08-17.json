Primary associations can be used in HubSpot tools such as <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/crm-setup/associations-enhancements-beta#use-associations-in-HubSpot-tools|lists and workflows>. For example, set up a workflow to only take action on records that are considered the _Primary_ association. The first company record associated with a contact, deal, or ticket is automatically set to _Primary_. This API supports changing which company is considered the primary.\n• *Unlabeled:* an association type added when any contact, company, deal, or ticket record is associated. This type denotes that an association exists, and will always returned in responses with a label value of `null`. When a record has a primary association or a custom association type, those types will be listed alongside the unlabeled association type.\n"
