The issue I'm having is that I am passing an image URL over to a ticket property (single-line text), but the client needs that to be formatted as a link. Is it possible to do so? I was hoping to be able to use a rich-text property and pass in html anchor link in the JSON object, but you can't put rich-text fields on forms, so that's a no go. If anyone has any thoughts I'd really appreciate it! Thanks!"

    "text": "Hi, I need help with a Custom Workflow Action. I've used this documentation (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/automation/custom-workflow-actions>) to arrive at my solution, but I'm not able to use the \"outputFields\" feature\n\nThe body of my Custom Workflow Action definition is as follows:\n\n```{\n  \"actionUrl\": \"<https://my-domain.xyz/v1/webhooks/HubSpot>\",\n  \"objectTypes\": [],\n  \"published\": true,\n  \"inputFields\": [\n    {\n      \"typeDefinition\": {\n        \"name\": \"campaignId\",\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"fieldType\": \"text\"\n      },\n      \"supportedValueTypes\": [\n        \"STATIC_VALUE\"\n      ],\n      \"isRequired\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"outputFields\": [\n    {\n      \"typeDefinition\":{\n        \"name\":\"couponCode\",\n        \"type\":\"string\",\n        \"fieldType\":\"text\"\n      },\n      \"supportedValueTypes\":[\n        \"STATIC_VALUE\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"objectRequestOptions\": {\n    \"properties\": []\n  },\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"en\": {\n      \"actionName\": \"Request a Coupon Code\",\n      \"actionDescription\": \"Request a coupon code for this user\",\n      \"appDisplayName\": \"Coupon Code\",\n      \"actionCardContent\": \"Coupon Campaign: {{campaignId}}\",\n      \"inputFieldLabels\": {\n        \"campaignId\": \"Campaign ID\"\n      },\n      \"inputFieldDescriptions\": {\n        \"campaignId\": \"The Campaign ID to request a coupon code for.\"\n      },\n      \"outputFieldLabels\": {\n        \"couponCode\": \"Coupon Code\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}```\n`outputFields` and `outputFieldLabels` are both included, and the API request to create the Action succeeds. However, the response body is missing both `outputFields` and `outputFieldLabels`:\n\n```{\n  \"id\": \"NNNNNNNN\",\n  \"revisionId\": \"1\",\n  \"functions\": [],\n  \"actionUrl\": \"<https://my-domain.xyz/v1/webhooks/HubSpot>\",\n  \"published\": true,\n  \"inputFields\": [\n    {\n      \"typeDefinition\": {\n        \"name\": \"campaignId\",\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"fieldType\": \"text\",\n        \"options\": [],\n        \"optionsUrl\": null,\n        \"referencedObjectType\": null\n      },\n      \"supportedValueTypes\": [\n        \"STATIC_VALUE\"\n      ],\n      \"isRequired\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"objectRequestOptions\": {\n    \"properties\": []\n  },\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"en\": {\n      \"inputFieldLabels\": {\n        \"campaignId\": \"Campaign ID\"\n      },\n      \"inputFieldDescriptions\": {\n        \"campaignId\": \"The Campaign ID to request a coupon code for.\"\n      },\n      \"actionName\": \"Request a Coupon Code\",\n      \"actionDescription\": \"Request a coupon code for this user\",\n      \"appDisplayName\": \"Coupon Code\",\n      \"actionCardContent\": \"Coupon Campaign: {{campaignId}}\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"objectTypes\": []\n}```\nMy function completes the workflow action successfully with the following response body:\n\n```{\n  \"callbackId\": \"ap-39998554-620951526013-9-0\",\n  \"outputFields\": {\n    \"hs_execution_state\": \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"couponCode\": \"2OmiIVfl\"\n  }\n}```\nI can see the response body in the workflow's Action Logs; however, I cannot see the Output Field in the workflow action or in the Copy Property action placed after my workflow step.\n\nI've tried creating a new Custom Workflow Action, but I'm still not able to see the Output Field. I've also tried creating a new workflow, but I'm still not able to see the Output Field.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks!"
