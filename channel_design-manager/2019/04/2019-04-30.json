    "text": "Hi y'all.\n\nWe are having issues with CSS file being truncated when published. We have a minified CSS file that we've uploaded through FTP, when we look at it in the design manager it is complete and contains all the lines of code we need.\nWhen we publish it and look at it online it is truncated after `@media (max-width:768px)`. (the complete line is: `@media (max-width:768px){#intro-video,#video{display:none}}`).\nWhen we remove this line and publish the changes the file is no longer truncated. Anyone know why or could help us how to solve this?",
