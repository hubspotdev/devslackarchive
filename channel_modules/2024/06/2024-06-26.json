I'm trying to create a breadcrumbs module and one of the features we need to have is dynamically change the row based on the table field (is that even possible?)\n\nwe're implementing it like this because there are some cases where we will be fetching the text from a different table.\n\nAny insights are appreciated :pray:  thank you!",
