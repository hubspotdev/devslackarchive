    "text": "Hi all. Has anyone noticed weird behavior when editing a drag and drop page if `button:before` is used in a theme’s css files?\nI placed the following code\n```button:before, .button:before {\n  transition: transform .3s ease-in-out, -webkit-transform .3s ease-in-out;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  content: \"\";\n  z-index: -1;\n  background: {{ button_bg_color }}; // this can be any color, doesn't have to be a variable\n}```\nin a theme’s `theme-overrides.css` file and it changes the HubSpot context menus. Is this correct behavior? Should my code affect the HubSpot CMS menus?"
