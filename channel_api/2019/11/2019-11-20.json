    "text": "Hello everyone,\nCan you help me on the CRM Extensions API? I have created 2 apps : one in HubSpot and a second one on rails and hosted on heroku. I connected the 2 apps following the protocol Oauth. The app using rails sends directly a json object without making a call API (post). The HubSpot app is configured to fetch the app rails and CRM card properties follow object json properties (in my case tiket_type, status, priority, project). However, no card appears in the crm . If the rails app makes a call API by following the url “<https://api.hubapi.com/extensions/sales-objects/v1/object-types?hapikey=####-####-##> ## - ####“, I have an answer 403. Can you help me please ? thank you in advance",
