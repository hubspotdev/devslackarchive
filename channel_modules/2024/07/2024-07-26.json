    "text": "Hello <@U03AKL6Q1B2>,\n\n We were having a conversation in the community about issues with the standard sandbox and custom modules not loading.\n\nHere's a recap of that conversation:\n\n \"After getting the main account imported to a new sandbox, it was set to use the same theme and then some pages needed to be recreated since pages are not imported. While creating the pages I noticed that most of the custom modules were missing and could not be loaded onto the pages, even though the files existed in the theme. This was from within the \"Website pages\" where you can use \"Add new module\" on the left side of the interface. The strange thing is that there are a couple custom modules showing up, but I don't see a difference between those and the ones that are missing.\"\n\n The modules in the Sandbox have different IDs than the ones in the main account. I noticed that early on but didn't think it would create any issues or cause them to not be visible in the \"Website pages\" section.\n\n I recently decided to test creating new versions of the \"missing\" custom modules in the Sandbox to see if the new ones would be visible. So far it doesn't look like it's working, but I need a little more time to try out a few more and make sure.\n\nOriginally I was looking for a way to make small updates to pages, mostly from within custom modules, without cluttering up the main account with clones. I was also looking at the Content Stating tool, but it's only for pages so I'd have to clone all the modules and swap them on the pages in the tool, which means cluttering up the main account.\n\nThanks for recommending that I create an account in Slack. It will be much easier to ask questions here than posting them in the community.\n\nAdrianF",
