I’ve figured out a way to use the `&lt;style&gt;` tag with `data-hse-inline-css=\"true\"` and it works great, and I’m wondering if there’s a similar way to inject styling into the `&lt;head&gt;` to be able to use media queries for specific case. I’m aware of the limitations of media queries in emails."
