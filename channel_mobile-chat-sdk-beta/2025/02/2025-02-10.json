    "text": "Hi <@U07DB91P073>, there can be few reasons (mostly configuration related), as listed below, for not receiving any messages in the `onMessageReceived()` . Can you please check if your app satisfies them all?\n\n1. Check if Firebase SDK is setup properly and that your app satisfies the minimum android version requirements.More details here <https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup>\n2. Also check if google GMS Gradle plugin was added to your app along with firebase messaging SDK as directed in the official android documentation above.\n3. Check if you have listed your custom FirebaseMessagingService to your project android manifest.\n4. Check you do not have any network issues.\n"

    "text": "Hi <@U07JHRHGYBV> ,regarding the issue of not receiving messages, I think there may be some misunderstanding. Our app can receive messages normally on onMessageReceived() , but when we reply to messages on the Help Disk in the HubSpot backend, onMessageReceived() does not receive any messages. I believe that communication between the app and Firebase is normal, and the problem should be with HubSpot -&gt;Firebase or other configuration information"
