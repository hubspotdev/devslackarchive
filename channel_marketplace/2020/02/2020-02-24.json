    "text": "<@U25C6PU56> and all here. Thank you for pushing on the HubSpot team around turnaround time for reviewing assets. We hear you and agree.  We’re actively planning new resources (and hires!) to meet ever increasing developer needs. We look forward to sharing more soon. Until then we very much appreciate your patience and hope we can get back to more reasonable turnaround times in the near future. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly with questions. Thanks!"
