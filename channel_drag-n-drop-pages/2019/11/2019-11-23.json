    "text": "Thanks <@U8THBCFC4>, sounds exciting. I absolutely want to use the DnD, but as I’m building a marketplace product, I’ve only really been able to spend a small amount of time playing with it. I think it would be nice if there was some type of loose roadmap for developers. This would  really help me make short/medium term decisions on what features/aspects of your platform to focus my effort on implementing :)",
