I have a similar use case (membership page, want to show a contact's details and some associated record information) and I'm wondering how I tell HubSpot to get the record data from the logged in user. Is that always going to be through `request_contact.contact_vid` , or is that something that <@UNL3L46D7> defined elsewhere in the example above?"

I have a membership page set up, with a module on it that is supposed to show the logged in contact's First and last name, email address, and then some of their associated object details. See the example below. How do I tell the CMS to grab the details dynamically off of the logged in user? I found `request_contact.contact_vid` in a thread here that asked a similar question, but it doesn't seem to do anything. Is there a specific way to define this?\n\n```    {% set professional = request_contact %} \n    {% set roles = crm_associations(request_contact.contact_vid,\"USER_DEFINED\",90) %}\n    {% set skills = crm_associations(request_contact.contact_vid,\"USER_DEFINED\",88) %}\n   \n  \n  &lt;section aria-label=\"professional_section\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"professional_div\"&gt;\n         \n        &lt;h1&gt;Name:&lt;/h1&gt; {{ professional.firstname }} {{ professional.firstname }}\n        &lt;p&gt; \n          &lt;b&gt;Email address:&lt;/b&gt; {{ professional.email }}\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        {% for role in roles.results %}\n        &lt;h2&gt;\n          Role: {{ role.role_name }}\n        &lt;/h2&gt;\n        {% for skill in skills.results %}\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          &lt;b&gt;Skill name:&lt;/b&gt; {{ skill.skill_name }}&lt;br&gt;\n          &lt;b&gt;Skill category:&lt;/b&gt; {{ skill.skill_category }}\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        {% endfor%}\n        {% endfor %}\n        \n      &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/section&gt;```\n",

    "text": ":wave: Hey folks! I've got a page leveraging a HubDB table that doesn't seem to reflect the table updates - specifically, I'm getting 1 value returned from the page editor &amp; previewer (which is the correct value in the published table) and an old value returned on the live URL, and I can't seem to break through it. Page is in content staging for the record.\n\nHere's what I've tried:\n• Re-publishing the HubDB table\n• Re-publishing the page\n• Checking the works to rule out caching (hsCacheBuster, incognito, different browsers, different wifi)\n• Adding the `local_dt` variable to try and break through the caching\nWith no luck. Anyone encounter anything similar/have something else they've tried?",
