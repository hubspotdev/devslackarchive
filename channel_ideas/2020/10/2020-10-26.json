Because of <https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax|re2>’s lack of support for negative look ahead, it is not possible to show a module field on the condition that it doesn’t match a regex. It is not currently possible to hide a field if it contains “<http://facebook.com|facebook.com>”, for instance."

Something like what ACF offers with image size validation to ensure they add images that are size properly would be awesome. The resize_image_url function only gets us half way since cropping isn't any option. If cropping was and option within the resize_image_url function, that would be a solution as well.",
