A user who was configured on those round robin meetings was deactivated (the person left the company) but HubSpot didn't remove that user from the Round Robin assignment and instead kept trying to schedule meetings on that persons calendar (because they looked completely available). Has anyone run into this bug before? HubSpot needs to have a check in their logic to exclude any deactivated user from Round Robin meeting assignment."
