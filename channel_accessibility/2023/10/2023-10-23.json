One small caveat though. Something a HubSpot app could theoretically do is use the source code API to grab your module and template code and highlight accessibility issues for you by running it through automated tests. Wouldn't be able to catch everything, but could be a decent monitoring tool to ensure someone doesn't muck up your compliance. I wouldnt trust automated \"fixing\" of the issues though.\n\nI don't know if any apps like that exist on our marketplace, it's just theoretically possible."
