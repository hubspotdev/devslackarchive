Simply change the logic of that if condition to just not show anything if `current_page_num ==1`. \n• remove `current_page_num == 1` from the logic. Then the first item per page will be featured.\nEach of these 3 solutions is fairly simple.\n\nThe community forum post there proposes overriding the number of posts that are in the array, which isn’t how things work.\n`loop.length` returns the number of items in the array you’re looping through. You can’t modify it nor would you want to as then it would be out of sync with the list you’re iterating through.\n\nYou could remove the featured item from the array you’re looping through prior to looping if you wanted though.\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/for-loops#loop-properties>"
