    "text": "I wish dashboard reports were more printer-friendly.  Our clients always want to print reports but they only print what shows on the screen and cut off anything else.  I know we can export to Excel and print but they don't want that because it loses the look of the screen format.  I wish you could format column sizes and such but alas that is not possible right now."
