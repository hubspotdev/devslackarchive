    "text": "There are a lot of ways you could do it, and it also kinda depends on what you’re meaning too.\n\nSo you could make it so any color in your theme is fully customizable by offering a color field at the theme level.\n\nAnother option is to provide a set of “color themes” using a choice field at the theme level. (probably less desirable for a company since it’s harder to brand).\n\nanother meaning you might be referring to is having say a dark theme, for users who prefer dark color schemes. The dark color schemes you could provide an alternate set of color fields in your theme, that control those colors and those colors are dependant on the css dark theme media query."
