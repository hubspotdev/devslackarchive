Everything was ok, I have over 30 modules, and after the update and running `watch` I can see only 12 modules on any page editor.\n\nI tried to update the label on `meta.json`  but they still refuse to appear under “Modules” on the pages editor.\n\nIf I stop cli `watch` and make a small edit on the html on a module and save it via the Web Design Manager they re-appear on my pages..\n\nAny ideas on what in the name of God could be happening?"
