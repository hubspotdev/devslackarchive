    "text": "Hello, I want to find the best way to create a complete transaction via the API.\n\nLet's say I have 2 products A &amp; B and a contact : <mailto:john@gmail.com|john@gmail.com>\n\nAnd I want, with the API to create a transaction for my contact with 2 line items : 1 for A and 1 for B\n\nFrom what I saw in the doc, I need to make this sequence of API calls :\n- Call 1 : Create the transaction : /crm/v3/objects/deals and get the transaction id.\n- Call 2 : Get the contact id with the email\n- Call 3 : Attach the transaction to the contact\n- Call 4 : Create line item for A : /crm/v3/objects/line_items and get the line item id\n- Call 5 : Create line item for B : /crm/v3/objects/line_items and get the line item id\n- Call 6 : Attach line item A to transaction : /crm/v3/objects/line_items/%lite-item-id%/associations/deal/%deal-id%/line_item_to_deal\n- Call 7 : Attach line item A to transaction : /crm/v3/objects/line_items/%lite-item-id%/associations/deal/%deal-id%/line_item_to_deal\n\nMy questions are :\nIs there an easier way to proceed ?\nCan I directly attach a transaction to a contact with just an email (just one call instead of 2 calls)?\nCan a attach my 2 line_items to my transaction with just one call ?\n\nThanks in advance for your help\n\nBest regards\n\nThomas"
