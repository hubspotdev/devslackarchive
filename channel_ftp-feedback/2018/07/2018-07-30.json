    "text": "I used to have a gulp task to upload files to FTP as I was working on them locally, but it hasn't worked for months. I'm using vinyl-ftp: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/vinyl-ftp> with the following config:\n```ftp.create({\n  host:     '<http://ftp.hubapi.com|ftp.hubapi.com>',\n  user:     login.username,\n  password: login.password,\n  log:      fancyLog,\n  port:     3200,\n  secure:   true\n})```\n(`login` and `fancyLog` are defined elsewhere, and are correct)\nI was hoping the recent update would fix it, but it seems the same. This definitely worked for a long time, but stopped working sometime earlier this year. It might have correlated with me updating Node to the most recent version, but I can't be sure of that. I can see it connecting and going through the directories in the log, but when it gets to upload the file it just says \"socket hang up\" and nothing gets uploaded:\n```[13:48:33] Using gulpfile ~\\Documents\\projects\\example\\gulpfile.js\n[13:48:33] Starting 'styles'...\n[13:48:34] CONN\n[13:48:35] READY\n[13:48:35] MLSD  /portals/123-portal/content/designs/example\n[13:48:35] PUT   /portals/123-portal/content/designs/example/assets/stylesheet.css\n[13:48:36] UP    13094% /portals/123-portal/content/designs/example/assets/stylesheet.css\n[13:48:36] Error: socket hang up\n[13:48:36] Finished 'styles' after 3.12 s\n[13:48:36] DISC```\nThe other thing that's weird is the huge percentage in the upload. I don't know if I've misconfigured something there, but it's always been like that even when it worked. I've tried using different files, different portals, nothing really seems to make a difference. Does anyone have a working ftp gulp script, or have I just misconfigured something? I really miss having this!"
