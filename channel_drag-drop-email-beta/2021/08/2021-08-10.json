    "text": "<@U01QE960QJX> I struggled a while ago with the same problem. Tried everything form inline `&lt;style/&gt;` blocks to HubL `{% require_css %}` syntax; nothing worked well. But maybe it helps you a bit: Check the stylesheet file from the e-mail preview, that file is attached from HubSpot to support their DnD Layout. You can use the class names from that file for your custom module. Or, a different way to achieve similar is to split your custom module into micro modules that fit within the DnD layout.\nBut a great step forward would be if HubSpot support that feature or extend the default DnD CSS with some additional helpful classes like bootstrap or other frontend libraries do."
