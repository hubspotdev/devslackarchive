    "text": "Hey guys! I’m new here, working on developing a crm app for sales teams, and need to create some UI elements/extensions like a custom card to put on sales reps ‘contact’ page. I haven’t been able to create a sandbox in the cli with the right permissions to do this. Is there a way around this? I’m hoping to avoid having to upgrade to an enterprise level sales package to code this, is that possible?"
