    "text": "<@U6TBZ66FN> as a continuation of our previous discussion in hubdb, I've also noticed the caching issue in the page manager. I just added some simple JS to the footer and hit \"update\" and then \"update and continue editing\" and my changes don't show but if I hit \"update page now\" the cache is updated and my changes are visible. The issue is a bit frustrating because it adds a few extra steps when I'm updating JS or CSS and sometimes I update the JS &amp; CSS frequently because certain styles display differently on HubSpot compared to my local environment. Is there anything I can provided to help you troubleshoot this issue?"
