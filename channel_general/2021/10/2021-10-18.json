Right now, the best path is to use two tag fields and do something like this:\n```&lt;a href=\"{{blog_tag_url('default', module.tag_field|string)}}\"&gt;{{module.second_tag_field}}&lt;/a&gt;```\nwhere the first tag field is outputting the slug and the second outputs the name.\n\nWe know its not ideal but be assured this is a high priority on our end. Ill keep you updated on the progress we make on the field update."

We use a lot of IP addresses and they change pretty frequently.\n\nIf you’re trying to verify that a request from HubSpot to your network is legitimate, you can probably use the <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/faq/validating-requests-from-HubSpot|request signature>. If you need to allow the IP for an outgoing request from your network to HubSpot, I’m not sure what the best solution would be, other than maybe a proxy to a different service/network that didn’t have such a strict firewall."
