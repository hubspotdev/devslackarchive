Alternatively you could also tack this code into your navigation or footer assuming those are being used on all pages.\n```{% set page = content_by_id(content.id) %}\n{% if not page.featured_image %}\n{% require_head %}\n  &lt;meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"yourImage.jpg\"&gt;\n{% end_require_head %}\n{% endif %}```\n<@UBF61JD2R>"
