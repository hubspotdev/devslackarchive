    "text": "I want to create a report that will show a how much a list has grown over time. For example, on day 1 the list had 100 contacts. On day 2 we added 20 contacts so the list is at 120. And then so on.\n\nThe catch is that I don’t want it to take into consideration contacts that leave the list. So if 50 people _left_ the list on day 3 (and no one new was added), the chart should still say 120 people as of day 3. I’m thinking that what I need to do is chart it out using the “Added to List Date” field. But that field only exists if the contact is still on the list.\n\nIs there any way to make this work?"
