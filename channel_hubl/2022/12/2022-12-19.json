I have `Hi{% if contact.email %} asdas{{ contact.email }}{% endif %}!` and it shows the image below. Does it ignore certain contacts? i.e. website team members. (this is being tested in the HubSpot module Design Previewer)",

This kind of makes sense, since the rich text field directly outputs markup — trying to filter any permutation of arbitrary HTML for character count or a regex match would take some pretty intense logic to pull off consistently and effectively.\n\nI know it’s not the most satisfying answer (and maybe not always applicable), but it’d likely be more fruitful to assess how you can use defensive design and defensive CSS practices to adjust the module to better account for long user inputs."

To my understanding, for performance reasons, none of the draft/preview tools load any of the HubSpot tracking scripts — they’re always going to use your fallback value. If you want to test with real list data, I believe you’ll have to test the module on a live, published page.\n\nI will note: I think that calling `{{ contact.data }}` without the `personalization_token()` function is always going to return a null value. Without the `personalization_token()` function, it’s going to be looking for the `data` property within the object contained at the variable `contact`, which isn’t going to be defined unless you explicitly do so."
