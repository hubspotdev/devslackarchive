    "text": "Casual reminder, if you haven’t rated the extension, please do so as more ratings = more people seeing the extension = more people contributing to the extension = more features faster\n\nWe have some big features we’re working on, they’re progressing but due to their complexity they won’t hit stable for a little while. It would be cool to push the update before Inbound but I know personally my work-workload has gotten pretty crazy in the lead up to it. If you’re interested in contributing check out our github <https://github.com/williamspiro/HubSpot-Developer-Extension>\n\nWhile there are the big features we’re working on there are also smaller tweaks that we could use an extra hand on so if you’re new to git those are a great way to get started. You can find those items by going to issues and filtering for “Good First Issue”"
