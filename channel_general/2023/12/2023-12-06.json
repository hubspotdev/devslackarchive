    "text": "Hello Everyone. I am new to HubSpot and not sure how to approach following problem. I have a HubSpot hosted website (<http://client.de|client.de>)  and need to do reverse-proxying to a an external url (<http://client-portal.rexx-recruitment.com|client-portal.rexx-recruitment.com>). I would have dynamic html-content on my HubSpot-website, the information of this code would be updated via requests to the external url/server. I have instructions how to do this with a website hosted on a nginx-/apache-webserver, but not with a HubSpot-cms-website. Is this possible? Thank you:)"
