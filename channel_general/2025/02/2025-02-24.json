So this means that even though they are giving you a preview for the unpublished ones, there must not be a real PDF in the background until you publish it, unfortunately.\n\nI was able to find these properties using the property API  `crm/v3/properties/{objectType}` . {objectType} in this case was `quotes`.\n\nGood luck!",
