If you'd like to make an update to one of your assets you'd go to your marketplace listings &gt; click on the gear icon to the right of the listing you want to update &gt; click edit listing and go through the regular submission process.\n2.) Yes the updates will be free to download to their existing portal if you update your theme. For a customer to update their theme they'd need to go to the marketplace from within their portal and update the asset from the \"Purchased\" tab.\n3.) Yes your theme files are readonly in the customers portal so any changes you make will be reflected in the customers portal if they download your update."

In terms of the other questions - I think it depends on the customer. Generally speaking I'd probably recommend someone uses the default theme so that they can pull down updates (users should be able to modify what they need using theme settings/with the DND page editor) but if someone was looking to use your theme as a starting point vs. a finished product then cloning it and modifying it would probably make more sense."
