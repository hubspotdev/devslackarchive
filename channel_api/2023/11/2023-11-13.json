    "text": "Hey everyone, I'm having trouble when it comes to upload a document via the Form API.\n\nThis is the endpoint I'm trying to post\n\"<https://api.hsforms.com/submissions/v3/integration/submit/#{portal_id}/#{form_id}>\"\n\nI was looking at this post from the HubSpot forum\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Form-Submission-API-with-file-upload/m-p/317752>\n\nWhere it says:\n*\"File upload properties are text properties, and they’re designed to store the URL of a file that’s uploaded to some storage platform. The property itself cannot store an actual file, so if you’re using an upload property in a custom form, you’d need to upload the file separately, and then store a URL that could be used to access that file in the actual form field being sent to HubSpot.\"*\n\nNow, all our documents from our app are stored in an AWS S3 Bucket and I can extract the url to send it to HubSpot, Im trying something like this:\n\n```def data\n      {\n        fields: [\n          {\n           ..... other fields,\n          {\n            objectTypeId: '0-1',\n            name: 'poliza_de_seguro_actual',\n            # Custom URL comes here\n            value: custom_url\n          }\n        ]\n      }\nend```\nBut when I try to look for my properties, the url it gives me is like this\n```<https://api-na1.HubSpot.com/form-integrations/v1/uploaded-files/signed-url-redirect/....filename=2007dc0b-5871-4d2e-8808-b740c7250083-poliza_de_seguro_actual-documents-4-esto_es_una_prueba.unknown>```\nBasically it tries to upload it to the *uploaded-files* integration with a *.unknown* format..\n\nIm looking everywhere for a solution but I have no idea on how to solve this.\n\nPlease help =("

I am trying to use the v3 crm company create batch api. `/crm/v3/objects/companies/batch/create` as far as I understand it, if any one record has an error (in this case `INVALID_OPTION`  error) then I should receive a HTTP 207 status code and be able to look at the 'errors' body, and some of the records should be processed and some not. However in this case I get an overall HTTP 400 and no indication of which are ok and which are not. How can I get a 207 mixed content response?",
