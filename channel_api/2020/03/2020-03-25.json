    "text": "Hi, I'm relatively new to the API. I got a few questions concerning the E-Mail endpoints.\n\nWhen i pull data from \"/email/public/v1/events\". I get the User, his actions and a campaignId. To get the name of the E-Mail i need to pull data from \"/email/public/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}\" where campaign_id is the id from the user's action. In the second response will be the contentId which corresponds to the id from the endpoint \"/marketing-emails/v1/emails\". Which now gives me the name of the E-Mail to match the users activity.\n\nNow to my Questions:\n1. Is there any other way to merge the e-mail name to the activity?\n2. Will there always be a single contentId per campaignId? Or could it be possible that, let's say one campaignId has multiple contentIds corresponding to multiple E-Mails?",
