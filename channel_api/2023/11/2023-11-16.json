Does anyone have experience doing this and/or know of any good resources for it? The docs doesn't really have any details about it."

    "text": "Hello. I have an app that integrates with client HubSpot accounts and have set up a public app to send webhooks to my app to update data in client accounts. The integration updates metrics we display on our platform. A client can set a criteria for their metric such as count number of deals created this quarter. What i am experiencing is multiple webhoooks firing from the public to my app on a single record creation or update. For example, after creating a single deal, 12 webhooks are fired. 3 webhooks relating to deal created event and 9 for a deal update event. Has anyone come across this sort of behaviour before? Is there something I am missing in the public app set up?",
