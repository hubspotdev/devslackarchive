    "text": ":rocket: *[Log Tracing for UI Extensions in Public Beta]*\n\nHi all - it's official! We've just launched the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/log-tracing-for-ui-extension-development|Log Tracing feature> for UI extensions with private apps. Customers can now connect all front-end React logs and back-end serverless function logs with a single Trace ID and view the full log trace in the '*Log Traces'* tab in the CRM Development page. We've also added the *'Extensions'* and '*Serverless functions'* tabs for customers to view comprehensive React and serverless log statements, copy the Trace ID, and open the relevant log trace. Please refer to the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/log-tracing-for-ui-extension-development|Changelog announcement> to learn more.\n\nWe'll continue to provide more impactful observability features for customers, so please stay tuned!\n\n*Changelog announcement:* <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/log-tracing-for-ui-extension-development>"

One thing I wanted to clarify:\n\nThis is currently possible on the left sidebar; you can set a card to display only if certain property conditions are met. However, it’s limited to just one property. In the screenshot below, my ‘BDR’ section will only show if the Lifecycle stage is Lead, Subscriber, or Marketing Qualified Lead.\n\nIs this how you would think about your card? Would 1 property suffice, or would you need multiple properties/conditions?\n\nThanks in advance for the input!",
