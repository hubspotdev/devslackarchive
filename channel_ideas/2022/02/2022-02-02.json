Sometimes I wish had them even when displayed as a slider",

    "text": "Hi there! Not sure where this question should go, so I thought here would be a good a place as any? Is there currently any functionality that allows for a single line field in a form to be validated against an existing database/list/property? The example I'm asking for is the case of asking for company information on a form. There are far too many companies for a drop down list to make sense, but I'd like the user to be able to fill out the form and have their company populate (similar to how an address validator populates as you begin typing your address). Thanks in advance for any thoughts/help!",
