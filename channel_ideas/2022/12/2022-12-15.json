    "text": "the business units feature is a great option to segment businesses but capture the contacts in a single CRM.. running into the issue of allowing the use of business units more diversely.. Can we associate business units on a sub domain or domain level rather than brand domain level? this is instrumental to grow the use of this feature. have several clients ready. Is this available (soon) in a (private) beta?"
