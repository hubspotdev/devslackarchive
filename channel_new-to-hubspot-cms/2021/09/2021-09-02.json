This is all working fine, and what I would like to do next is host the web app (<http://app.skimli.com|app.skimli.com>) with Firebase hosting. What I'm curious is how SSL would work from the HubSpot side. Would I need to create another cert on the Firebase side or could I import the cert from HS to Firebase?",

    "text": "I am fairly certain that HubSpot uses a free SSL service like LetsEncrypt to spin up those SSL certs and keep them renewed. I don't think you'll be able to use them elsewhere, I'd likely suggest just purchasing a separate SSL certificate to install on the firebase hosting, or see if using something like LetsEncrypt is possible in that firebase environment."
