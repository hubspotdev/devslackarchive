    "text": ":wave: Hi everyone! I'm <https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlinsiegrist/|Caitlin Siegrist> and I run HubSpot's Accelerator programs. We have piloted a Theme Accelerator which went well so we'd like to open up the opportunity to more providers like you. The Accelerator's objective is to fill our Asset Marketplace with high quality, affordable themes. In addition to 1:1 technical guidance &amp; marketing support, you will be eligible for compensation. If you're interested, please complete <https://forms.gle/zZznM9QUrTT7vWpa6|this form> &amp; I'll add you to the interest list for our next program kickoff (likely kicking off late February). Any questions, feel free to message me directly. Thanks!",
