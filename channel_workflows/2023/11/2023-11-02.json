    "text": "Hey folks.\n\nI have a contact list of say, 1000 people, and I want to enroll them to a workflow that needs to call an external API. That external API has rate limits (hypothetically 1 API request per minute). Is there any way to tell the workflow to pace the requests, rather than executing them all ASAP. I've been thinking of using Delay but it appears that Delay only accepts static delay periods.\n\nAny ideas?",
