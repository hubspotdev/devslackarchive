I recently sent an email campaign and the preview text included a comma in a number ($20,000 for example) and it keeps the comma in the Email tool but removes it in the email test/actual email. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is this a bug with HubSpot or a feature to help prevent being flagged as spam for including a large number like 20,000?",

Is there anything else that counts as a CRM hit that we should be aware of?\n\nI’d also love to know if this limit is exclusive to CRM calls, or if it also applies to HubDB calls?"
