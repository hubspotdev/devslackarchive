    "text": "Hey gang, looking for a solution to a HS filtering limitation, hopefully solvable!\n\nIn a nutshell\n• I need to have a single contact.property with a value - Product A | Product B | Product C. (up to 20 products)\n• The property value is to be decided by how many times a customer has viewed a product page in the last 5 days.\n    ◦ Product A viewed 4 times in last 5 days\n    ◦ Product B viewed 1 time in last 5 days\n    ◦ *Product C viewed 10 times in last 5 days &lt;--Winner!*\nThe first issue is that you can only select 1 of 2 available refinements when creating a filter using lead scoring. Date OR Number of views, there is no option to select both. E.g. You can't say, `Customer has at least 10 page views of a URL containing Product C less than 5 days ago`. You can say `Customer has at least 10 page views of a URL containing product C` OR `Customer has at least one page view of a URL containing product C less than 5 days ago` . If you tried to add these separately, you can end up with false positives - For example: A person who viewed 1 Product C page less than 5 days ago, but has 20 views in their lifetime would qualify into the filter.\n\nAny thoughts on implementing both at the same time? It's probably not the best approach anyway, you'd have to create/set-up a lead scoring property for every product! Open to suggestions.\n\nIf we fix the first issue, the second issue arises, how do we get HubSpot to say \"Product C is the winner, set property to Product C\"? Fixing issue 1, you could probably use an API to compare the lead scoring properties, but thought I'd see what the collective thinks first!\n\nCheers",
