Is it possible to _send_ information about a contact following a form submission to another system, in JSON format, using an app/webhook approach? If so, I just need to point the team in the right direction. Any help greatly appreciated.",

It is really hard to make a developer team to move to another solution, so when we talk of a solution that can be X time more expensive it's almost impossible. What do you think?",
