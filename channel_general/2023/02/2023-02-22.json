    "text": "Hello, I am perfoming A/B test and I am wondering what is treated as \"Total submissions\" on my page - probably Contact Form being filled in. Is there any way to change that conversion to button being clicked? My company real conversion should be \"Get Started\" button clicked because users are signing in for a trial there.\nMy company's website is <https://www.ziflow.com/>\nWhat I ultimately need is to check how many times \"Get started\" button was clicked on a particular A/B version of a page. Is there any way of changing that?\nAnd to make things clear - I need to test variations of a page based on a copy in header not variations of a CTA button.\nMany thanks for any help !!! :pray: :pray: :pray:\nVersion A of a website <https://www.ziflow.com/-ab-variant-72d4857e-325a-4796-bb26-5067dbef948c?hs_preview=JfYnhlwv-10182829><https://www.ziflow.com/-ab-variant-72d4857e-325a-4796-bb26-5067dbef948c?hs_preview=JfYnhlwv-101828296752|...>\nVersion B of a website <https://www.ziflow.com/?hs_preview=FXZJpPpH-89811731285>",

Sorry if I'm not in the good channel for this request, this is my first time here on Slack :slightly_smiling_face:\nI have a question about HubSpot objects, if someone can help me :pray:\nContact and Deals are associated together, okay. So we have a property \"Associated Contact Email\" in Deals and we can filter deals with this property.\n\n• What if we want other properties from Contact into Deals, like \"Associated Contact First name\" ? I didn't find how to do it.\n• Also, I associated a Custom object with Deals, and I wish to have some properties from my Custom object directly in the Deal, just like the \"Associated Contact Email\" property, to filter Deals, why do I can't ?\n• Finally, is it possible to have some Lookup (just like in Airtable for those who know)? For example, If I associate 2 different Custom objects with Deals, I wish to find one of this Custom object inside the other, is it possible ?\nThank you for your help, I'm new in the HubSpot world :slightly_smiling_face:",

Just like in Airtable in fact.. So I wanted to create a workflow to achieve that but workflow can't create associations except with Associ8, or maybe I miss something ?\nI think the only way to achieve that is:\n• With Associ8 in workflow (but not free)\n• With Custom code in workflow (can be the best solution)\n• With external code like personal lambda or Zapier, tools like that..\nI just wished that HubSpot allow us to do that directly in HubSpot workflow."
