    "text": "Almost spot on, however we're going a level deeper in this case. A shockingly small number of customers are even aware of that setting for CTAs, so very few people actually use it meaning if we used that it wouldn't work for enough people. We're going a step deeper and instead going to directly use the default COS domain, so that it'll work for all customers. Ideally this would replace the custom CTA tracking domain, likely in the short term, that way every customer gets that feature out of the box too"

If the domain was disconnected, or if there were any temporary issues, the CTAs would completely fail. On a slightly more realistic example though, if you ever wanted to change the domain, every single CTA (and form, ideally these solutions apply to both) would need to be re-embedded on the site with the new domain name"
