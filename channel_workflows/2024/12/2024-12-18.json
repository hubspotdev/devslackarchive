    "text": "Hi <@U04C0NVUQ7Q> :wave:\nYes, it should be possible to achieve that via custom code workflow actions. However, this would depend on the volume of data you're working with as custom code workflow actions currently have a max execution time limit of 20 seconds. Also, records of which object-type will be enrolled in the workflow? You mention the \"Event\" object, but I don't see this as a standard option when creating a HubSpot Workflow, but maybe you're working with a custom object?"
