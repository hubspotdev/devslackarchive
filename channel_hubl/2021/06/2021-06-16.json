This is for an email module.\n\nJust for clarification, I am trying to display a property called company.google_pagespeed_mobile in emails to contacts that are associated with that company.\n\nWithin the email template, just calling company.google_pagespeed_mobile doesn't return the value, so I assumed I needed to use a function to accomplish displaying the value.\n\nAre you suggesting using personalization_token(company.google_pagespeed_mobile|int, \"fallback\"), or just company.google_pagespeed_mobile|int by itself? Either way on my end, the former comes back with a warning and the latter still returns 0 on non-zero values.\n\nI'm sorry if I am misunderstanding! Or maybe this is a limitation within email modules?"

On the portal I'd like to show customers who log in all of their historical documents that we've produced for them. Right now i'm using CRM objects to display {{ company.file_name1 }} on a \"my documents\" page, which works great. The issue is having to create a company property for each file i'd like to upload and display on the page... Is there a more efficient way to do this where I can upload several in bulk and show dynamically depending on who's logged in?"
