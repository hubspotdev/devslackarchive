I'm going to be building this design - <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QzxcN3Od9n8hVk1hw_0SkhI9cf36aex0?usp=sharing>  - I'm trying to figure out if this is something I should create with the drag and drop builder, or import it as custom HTML. I'm also not sure which responsive framework to use (bootstrap, foundation, custom), and does it even matter?"
