    "text": "Hi, proper API noob here. All i'm trying to do is pull a list of all submissions for a specific form into a Google Sheet in one go for ongoing reporting purposes - can I do this without 'paging' or is there a way to automatically pull in results from all subsequent pages? Currently I'm just using this and only getting a limited number of responses plus a 'paging next link'. Any help appreciated.\n\n```<https://api.hubapi.com/form-integrations/v1/submissions/forms/[my-form-id]?hapikey=[my-api-key]>```",
