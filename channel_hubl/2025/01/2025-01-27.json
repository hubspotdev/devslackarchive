    "text": "Hey <@U04KYUFCWUV>, you can do this with a bit of CSS.\nThe most basic one to get something like this(screenshots), you can add\n```a[href=\"javascript:;\"]{\n    text-decoration:none;\n    pointer-events:none;\n    cursor:default;\n}```\nto your theme css file. This will apply the CSS rules only to nav items without a link.\n\nIf you want to create a menu like <http://clickup.com|clickup.com> has(just an example; all the icons and such), it can be done with the advanced menu function since you can wrap the menu label in a span and therefore add a custom class, but this might get quite messy and unmaintainable real quick :slightly_smiling_face: Therefore I'm always recommending to create either a custom module(global can be benifitial) or use a HubDB for this. Those options can be benifitial if you're thinking about adding some icons, text/descriptions to nav items..",
