    "text": "Hey all! Does anyone know how to avoid the background color of the email body changing color when the email gets forwarded? I know that you cannot always control what happens in styles when emails get forwarded, but I have gone through my email body background colors with a fine-toothed comb in my templates in design manager, and I cannot figure out why it is changing when I do a test forward of the email! I'd be happy to send a helpful friend here an email forward to show you what I mean. Thank you!!",
