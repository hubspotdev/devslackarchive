    "text": "Hey dev community :corgi-wave:\nThe HubSpot workflows team has just kicked off a private beta aimed at helping marketers optimize their workflow outcomes. The feature is a new random split branch action, that allows you to segment records into any number of equal sized groups. You could then test out different tactics, like varying methods of communication or use of timing &amp; delays.\n\nWould you like to join the beta to try it out? You'd be able to in any of your accounts that have a Marketing Pro or Enterprise subscription. Please DM me a hub ID if you're interested and I'll give your account access and also be available for any questions or feedback you have. :thanku:",
