HubSpot workflow extension objects\n    ◦ similar to workflow webhooks, but they're managed on the application, they're extension triggers on the workflow and have a different format on how HubSpot sends the data \nyou might need some custom behaviour between your workflow and your google cloud, when you receive a webhook and how you should interact with google cloud's api."
