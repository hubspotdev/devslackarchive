    "text": "Hi <@U03BKBGD84F>, I was able to do it but as you said you first need to find a contact before you can update it. Comparing values is not necessary though. You can use\n\nProperties = {\n“Firstname”: (object.attribute.get(“firstname”) or &lt;default value&gt;) \n}\n\nIf the .get method returns null (a.k.a. If the property field is empty), you will use the default value to update the property. If the property already has a value it will simply not update it. "
