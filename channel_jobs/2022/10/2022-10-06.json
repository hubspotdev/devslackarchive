    "text": "Hey there,\n\nWe want to expand our 1.5 dev team with a freelance front-end developer to lead our HubSpot CMS projects.\n\nIs this you?\n• You have almost OCD-like attention to detail (an extra space or tab bothers you).\n• You don't use frameworks like Bootstrap. And vanilla JS. Yeah, baby. That's you.\n• But if it's justified to use any framework, you know exactly why it's necessary, and you always consider performance over convenience.\n• You're not only familiar with HubSpot CMS. But also the other hubs. At least to some extent\n• This is the way, said the Mandalorian. But you also have your way. We don't only want your skills. We want your brains because this is as much a coding gig as it's a thinking gig. \n• Bonus points if you can jump into a project immediately (not a requirement).\n• And obviously, you're a self-starter who communicates clearly, and understands what influences user experience and all the technical SEO stuff.\nWanna take on some extra work and do fun stuff with a fun bunch?\nEmail <mailto:benjamin@inlink.se|benjamin@inlink.se> and write CMS pro in the headline.",
