    "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nWhat is the best way to display a menu dynamically? Let me explain: we want two different menus, one for articles with the “empresas” tag and another for articles with the “particulares” tag. What is the best way to apply this to articles in HS?\n\n        `{% set article_tags = content.topic_list %}`\n        \n        `{% if \"empresas\" in article_tags %}`\n          `{% module \"Menu Blog CTT Empresas\" path=\"@HubSpot/simple_menu\" %}`\n        `{% elif \"particulares\" in article_tags %}`\n          `{% module \"Menu Blog CTT Particulares\" path=\"@HubSpot/simple_menu\" %}`\n        `{% else %}`\n          `{% module \"top_nav_menu\" path=\"@HubSpot/simple_menu\" %}`\n        `{% endif %}`\n\nI’ve tried something like this as I think HubL can already solve it and no need JS.\n\nThank you in advance"

    "text": "Actually overall a bit frustrated on this. Just had a chat with support and they don't know this neither.\nLet's talk about Favicons.\nAll the branding images / favicons are added in the settings pages.\nOn <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/variables> there is a favicon_link HUBL code, which when used, shows the following:\n```<link rel=\"SHORTCUT ICON\" href=\"\">```\nThis does not load in the favicon, and just gives an empty field.\nI found here on the forums, to use the following:\n```{% block favicon %}\n<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"{{ brand_settings.primaryFavicon.src }}\" />\n{% endblock favicon %}```\nBut this is nowhere mentioned inside the HUBL documentation.\nHow are you supposed to properly figure this out?",
