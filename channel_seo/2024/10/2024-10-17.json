Similar other On page factors like meta, title and heading tags also need to be checked. We often tend to miss these things due to which the On page optimization gets impacted.\n\nOn the other hand from Off page perspective if there is change in the URLs then there will be impact.\n\nIn my opinion and experience even though we say that there will be no impact when we transfer from one platform to other but the actual reality is that that there will some impact.\n\nI am happy to discuss further so let me know how would you like to proceed further. :slightly_smiling_face:"
