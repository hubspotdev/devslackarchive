    "text": "Hello. I did write that Script with the idea to look for the contact before to know, do I create new ones or do I update them. Something done a million times probably. My problem is that the script runs to fast somehow and doesn’t wait for the response. I thought it works with await. Because every time I run it locally I get a result back or it tells me “error &gt; search_contact: Error: unexpected end of file. Does anyone has me a tipp?  Thank You. :blush:\n\n*Seems it’s an Axios issue, I did downgrade and the code works fine.*\n*<https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/5346>*\n\n```const search_contact = async () =&gt; {\n\tconst search_contact_data = {\n\t\t\"filterGroups\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"filters\": [\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"operator\": \"EQ\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"propertyName\": \"email\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": email\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t}\n\ttry {\n\t\tconst search_contact_response = await <http://axios.post|axios.post>('<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search>', search_contact_data, {\n\t\theaders: {\n\t\t\t'content-type': 'application/json',\n\t\t\t'authorization': token\n\t\t}\n\t})\n\tconst search_contact_total = search_contact_response.data;\n\tconsole.log(search_contact_total);\n\n\tif (search_contact_total.total === 1) {\n\t\tconst search_contact_id = search_contact_response.data.results[0].id;\n\t\tconsole.log(search_contact_id);\n\t\treturn search_contact_id\n\t}\n\n\t} catch(error) {\n\t\tconsole.log('error &gt; search_contact: ' + error)\n\t}\n}\nconst search_contact_id = await search_contact();```",
