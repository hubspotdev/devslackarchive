The form is connected to a channel in the Inboxes section and everything is set as default.\nMy goal is to have tickets created upon submission of this form reporting the subject and description that I set as default values in the form, but HS instead just generates a default subject on its own (\"New ticket created from form submission\") and an empty description (see attached images).\nAny idea on how to achieve this?\nThanks",

These have been uncertain times for many of us, but the generosity of knowledge sharing in this Slack puts a smile on so many faces. Thank you all for growing with the HubSpot platform and supporting each other along the way. We’re so excited to roll out even more community programs for y’all to do just that in 2023. Hoping y’all get a chance to rest and enjoy some well deserved time with family and friends this season. Looking forward to working with all of you in 2023! \n\nAll the best from myself and the entire HubSpot team. :orange_heart: :sparkles: :orange_heart: "
