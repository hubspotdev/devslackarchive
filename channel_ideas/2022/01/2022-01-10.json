See example in <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#slugify|Django docs>.\nIt would be for ease-of-use and prevent the necessity for multiple string filters – i.e. `{{ string|trim|lower|regex_replace('\\W', '-') }}`",

    "text": "100% agree. Adding on to this, there seem to be a ton of useful filters and functions missing from HubL that seem to b present in Jinja. I'm going to make a separate \"idea\" pretty soon I guess, with a list of ones I think should be added. But yeah, I have been writing a lot of macros to accomplish a lot of things that would be nice if they were built in--- and some things that are easily done with filters and functions in Jinja2/Twig don't even seem to be possible with just macros in HubL."
