I've set up the HubSpot extension, I've added the file associations, I've added the emmet languages, but as soon as I switch a file to HTML-HubL I lose all tag completion support in HTML, and it doesn't seem to be doing anything with the HubL either...\n\nAnyone out here who might have their VSCode set up properly to fix all that that'd be willing to point me in the right direction?",
