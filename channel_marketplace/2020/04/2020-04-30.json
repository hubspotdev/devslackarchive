    "text": "Awesome, so you wouldn't need to add drag and drop areas to it (DND areas aren't currently allowed in standard templates/template packs). To make an update to a template you'd just go into your design manager, update the template to add/remove/edit what you were looking for. Then once that is done, publish your changes in the template. After publishing your changes, you'd then go to your marketplace listings page (Asset Marketplace in the main nav &gt; Listings), click on the gear icon to the right of the asset you want to update, and click on \"Edit Listing\" on the drop down. From there you'd go through the normal flow of submitting your asset and once you're done it will be in the marketplace queue for review (the previous approved version will remain in the marketplace until the new version is approved). Let me know if you have any questions!"
