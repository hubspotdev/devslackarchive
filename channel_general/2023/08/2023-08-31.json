We push down our banner when it’s set to be the top one, but the fixed nav is overlaying that.\n\nOne thing you could do is add an offset to the top nav of the size of the banner and they’d both be displayed, we add in a fake div to offset so noting would be hidden on the page\n\nExample I’ve offset the top banner by 75px there and they both display.\n\nWould have to remove when cta is dismissed.\n\nCould also change nav to be absolute positioned and relative to the body-wrapper div since we push down outside of that",
