    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nIs it possible to hide modules in the page creation tool based on a portal?\nTo give some context, I develop modules that are then deployed via the cli on two portals. (these modules can be used on both environments).\n\nHowever, I have a module that must be present on one portal, what can I do to hide it on the other one?\n\nTell me if u don't understand my issue... ThanksÂ :slightly_smiling_face:",
