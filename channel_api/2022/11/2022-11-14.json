Currently working on an application which allows data to be saved in a custom object but I am running into a CORS error (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing) and wondering if anyone has come across this? Have been making use of a CORS Anywhere script on Heroku but have run into a rate limiter on cloudflare which has stopped everything working so hoping there is a better solution or someone else has come across this that can point me in the right direction to get it resolved? Im pretty confident I can use serverless functions to handle the API requests for me but ideally would like to avoid this if there is a better solution. Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:",
