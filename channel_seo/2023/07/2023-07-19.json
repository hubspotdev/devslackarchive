    "text": "Is anyone else struggeling with this issue: I use embedded HubSpot Forms in my Webflow Page that I translate via weglot. As Weglot does not translate the form fields, I created two different forms for the German and English website. To reduce loading time, I tried loading the script inside the &lt;head&gt; section and refer to it in the respective iFrames, the forms are working but speed test still shows the script being loaded multiple times. Thanks in advance",
