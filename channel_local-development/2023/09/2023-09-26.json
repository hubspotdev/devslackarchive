Make sure it's inside the /app/extensions/ directory and not in a subdirectory, and try again.```\nI have reviewed the logs and it appears it is building the app.functions directly without issue, but it's having issues on the extensions folder.\n\nHas anyone had any luck getting multiple private apps to work under the same project?",
