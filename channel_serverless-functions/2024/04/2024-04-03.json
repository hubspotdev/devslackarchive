    "text": "Hi!\nI was trying to use and create functions for custom workflow actions but it does not display in my workflow defination once created. What I mean by that is, I am sending the below payload to create a custom workflow action along with a simple function:\n{\n  \"actionUrl\": \"<https://xfxkqra5h3.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Test/>\",\n  \"published\": true,\n  \"inputFields\": [],\n  \"labels\": {\n     \"en\": {\n       \"actionName\": \"CDP-TP-1 opt-in consolidation\",\n       \"actionDescription\": \"Workflow Action to consolidate opt-in and provide it as result for BU-1\",\n       \"appDisplayName\": \"CDP-TP-1 OPT-IN App\",\n       \"actionCardContent\": \"CDP-TP-1 OPT-IN Automation\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"objectTypes\": [\n   \"0-1\"\n ],\n  \"objectRequestOptions\": {\n   \"properties\": [\n    \"customer_id\",\n    \"email\"\n  ]\n },\n  \"functions\": [\n    {\n       \"functionType\":\"PRE_ACTION_EXECUTION\",\n       \"functionSource\":\"exports.main = (event, callback) => {callback({\\\"data\\\": {\\\"field\\\": \\\"email\\\",\\\"phone\\\": \\\"1234567890\\\" }});\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nNow when I fetch my function defination, it gives me this where only the function type is mentioned but not the source. Can anyone help me what am I missing in here?",
