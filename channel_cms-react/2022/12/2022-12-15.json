    "text": "Thank you all for the early feedback on JS Building Blocks! We’ve made the following minor changes to improve the setup experience.\n\n• Resolved the Windows-specific path errors in the <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nV9aU8t0ovQZ53mxaqNEQtLU6hFnba9v3er-Vasvqds/edit|Hello World project >and dev server. Windows users can now run the dev server.\n• Added two <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/local-development-cli|CLI parameters> to the dev server:\n    ◦ `-c` or `--config`, which let you give an explicit path to a HubSpot.config.yaml\n    ◦ `-a` or `--account`, which lets you select an account by name from the HubSpot.config.yaml loaded (i.e. one different than the default)\n• Caution against using “Yarn Modern” for this initial beta release. Npm and “Yarn Classic” are the recommended package managers. We do not have plans to support “Yarn Modern” during the duration of this private beta. The <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nV9aU8t0ovQZ53mxaqNEQtLU6hFnba9v3er-Vasvqds/edit|documentation> has been updated to reflect this recommendation.\nAs always, we’re excited to see what you build and hear what you think. Let us know if you run into any further issues.",
