    "text": "Hello,\n\nI have a workflow that sends an email to 200 people, and after the action \"send email\", i added a webhook that will inform my BE that the email was sent, and this will consequently delete all rows in my hubdb table.\n\nHowever, this is not ideal, as this will trigger the webhook 200 times, basically after each time the email is sent. (per contact enrolled)\n\nWhat do you think is the best approach to trigger the webhook only once ? i want all the emails to be sent, and i will put a delay of 3 4 hours, then i want the webhook to be triggered once to delete the table rows.\n\nMaybe enroll in a new workflow that has the webhook ? but what would be the enrolment trigger to only have 1 contact enrolled daily so that the webhook will be triggered only once"
