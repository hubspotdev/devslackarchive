    "text": "that’s like asking; how do you actually build a bike? :slightly_smiling_face: as far as I know, there’s no integration / plugin that pushes wordpress posts to HubSpot, but you could google a bit, you never know. If that’s not available, what you’d need to do is build a nice little wordpress plugin that pushes wordpress posts (or the metadata you need to display them) to a hubdb, using the api. Then you can build a HubSpot module that reads the hubdb table and spits out the posts on a page.",
