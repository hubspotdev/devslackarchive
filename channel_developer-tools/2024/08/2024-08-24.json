    "text": "Question for someone who has made public or one-to-many apps. How does hosting work? Having gone through the tutorials and the docs I could find, it looks like you upload the code to HubSpot and they take care of execution, but there's not a ton of details arounds that (supported languages / frameworks, size, compute, or bandwidth constraints, etc). Is correct and is that information out there somewhere and I am just looking at the wrong? Context, I'm being asked to ballpark a public app build that is pretty basic (just pulling basic financial transactions out of one system and tying them to matched or newly created HubSpot contacts), but the lack of environment information is making me nervous, lol."
