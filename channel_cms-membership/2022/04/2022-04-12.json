    "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI'm trying to configure SSO\nI tried to follow this docs <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/website-pages/set-up-single-sign-on-sso-to-access-private-content#set-up-sso-for-a-saml-based-application>\n\nMaybe I'm wrong for my approach,\nMy approach is as following:\nI need to have a private page let's say `<http://knowledge.mydomain.com|knowledge.mydomain.com>` and this page should be only accessible to loggedin users to my system\nIf there were no authentication, then I'll redirect him to SSO page to add his credentials and then redirect him back to the `<http://knowledge.mydomain.com|knowledge.mydomain.com>`\n\n\nbut my problems is:\nI'm trying to configure it with my rails application\nI tried to follow this guidelines here:\n<https://ossoapp.com/blog/saml-sso-rails/>\n\nbut I'm stuck in the redirection, the HubSpot should send a request with SAMLRequest query parameter, then I'll decode this SAMLRequest params.\n\nthen my question is, after decode this, How I'll validate the user? where the user will add his email?\n\nwhat I believe is:\nI should have a login page (username + password) then when click login, I'll send to my rails application (SAMLRequest + username + password)\nin my backend code, I'll validate the username and password, but what is the use for SAMLRequest in this case?\n\nAny support please?\n\nRegards"
