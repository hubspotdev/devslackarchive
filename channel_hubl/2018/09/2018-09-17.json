    "text": "Hi all - question about Google Tag Manager implementation on HubSpot:\n\nGTM installation involves two steps: placing a `&lt;script&gt;` tag with config details in the `HEAD`, and placing a `&lt;noscript&gt;` alternate just after the `BODY` opens. If you don't do *exactly* this, GTM will work, but Google will complain, and some services (like Webmaster Tools and AdWords) can fail as a result.\n\nMost services (HubSpot included) offer \"Site Header HTML\"/\"Site Footer HTML\" script injection. \"Site Header HTML\" is a fine place to put the `&lt;script&gt;` GTM tag, but \"Site Footer HTML\" happens right before the `BODY` _closes_; Google wants it to be just after the `BODY` _opens_. Unless you're using a Coded File template, this is hard to pull off in HubSpot.\n\nGTM users, how do *you* manage GTM implementation in HubSpot?"
