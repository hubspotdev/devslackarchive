Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>. Thanks for making the HubSpot Developer Slack easier to use for everyone!",
