    "text": "Hello - trying to determine how to set a value in event.session from a javascript snippet that is called from a chatflow.  I have a bot that asks a bunch of qualifying questions, and then I go hit a back-end service, providing the parameters I gathered (via event.session.parsedResponses.modulename.parsedResponse).\n\nI want to use the output from this backend call in a subsequent service call I make later in the chat flow.  How can I store/do that?"
