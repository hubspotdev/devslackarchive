    "text": "Since there is not a channel related to website security, I wasn't sure where else to post this but here.\n\nMy client is requesting a strong Content Security Policy implemented for their website. While testing with CSP Reporting-Only, I am getting the error with HubSpot generated link elements in the DOM, the following as an example:\n\n`<link class=\"hs-async-css\" rel=\"preload\" href=\"<https://www.domain.com/hs-fs/hub/xxxxxxx/hub_generated/template_assets/xxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxx/NAME-OF-CMS-THEME/css/fonts/fonts.min.css>\" as=\"style\" onload=\"this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'\">`\n\nThe issue is that this HTML generated by the CMS uses inline event listeners, i.e. onload, which is discouraged for website security reasons. So does anyone know, is there a way around this within HubSpot CMS capabilities? Everything I've read suggests that I can't get a functioning CSP without adding 'unsafe-inline' to the script-src CSP directive. However, this is not fully secure, and does not satisfy the client's request.\n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated, thx!"
