    "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am new to development in the HubSpot and looking for some help from the community.\n\nWe are trying to build a form in HubSpot for creating tickets from the forms and  we would like to add the companies and deals(already in the HubSpot) as dropdown in the form so that we can know about the company and deal for which the ticket belongs to. Is it possible to add companies and deals dynamically on HubSpot form load?\n\nThank you :pray:"
