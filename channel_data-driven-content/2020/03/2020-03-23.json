    "text": "Iâ€™m new to HubDB here. Is it possible to build a Calculator that displays content based on the output of the calculator? I am working on creating an Instant Credit Approval calculator for a client, and there are 9 different options based on net income. There would be 3 fields to this: Monthly Income, Additional Monthly income (such as from a spouse or monthly credit) Total Monthly Expenses. If the net income was between $200-$300, it would display approval of $1000, $301-$400 would be $1500, and so on up to $5000 in credit.\n\nOriginally, I had built a field that would go to a thank you page with a 10 second delay between the pages to allow HubSpot to update smart content to display the approved amount, but due to the HubSpot Cookies being turned off to not overwrite the customer data, the thank you page would not update the content from the original entry."
