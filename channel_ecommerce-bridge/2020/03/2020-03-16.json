    "text": "Hey good people! I am pretty new to the HubSpot CMS and I need help from someone experienced to get more insight on what HubSpot CMS is capable of and what its not. We are planning to build the whole Online Store and a Customer Portal using HubSpot CMS as a UI tool and HubDb for some other things. I am just not sure if it is a correct tool for this. For now I just want to know if someone did that before or maybe doing that now."

    "text": "hi <@UTZ5FK750>, it depends on how transactional your will be, you need to build from scratch your online store using hubdb, and that will be a lot of work, instead i would recommend you - build a store with WooCommerce and connect it with HubSpot using our integration - <https://makewebbetter.com/product/HubSpot-woocommerce-integration-pro/>",
