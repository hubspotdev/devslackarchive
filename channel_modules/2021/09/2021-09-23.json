So they will remember the content that was in them so long as they are living in the same structure as the previous template.\n\nIE if you clone a template It will look exactly the same with all of the modules content still there. But if you “group” content in an additional wrapper. Or move a module from a static group to a flex column then you will lose all of it’s data and you will have to re enter it."
