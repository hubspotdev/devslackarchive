    "text": "global-module content can be translated inside the global-content-manager. but if you have hard-coded language strings, you better go with if/else expressions like:\n```{% if (content.slug is string_startingwith \"de/\") or (content.slug == \"de\") or (\".de\" in request.domain) %}\n    {% set myVar = \"myString\" %}\n{% endif %}```\nif you want to use it as external file you can create a new html template \"_multilingual.html\" and place you content there. The file can be used with \"import\" like this:\n```{% import \"/_multilingual.html\" as lang %}\n{{ lang.myVar }}```"
