You will be unable to release the app cards to more accounts until Ecosystem Quality has confirmed your new app cards meet <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/build-ui-extensions-for-public-apps#app-marketplace-guidelines|these additional guidelines>. Email your app ID, most recent build ID, developer Hub ID, test account ID, and instructions on locating your app card in the test account to <mailto:app-card-review@HubSpot.com|app-card-review@HubSpot.com> to start this process.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once approved, <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/listing-your-app#edit-a-live-app-listing|edit your app listing> to highlight the new app cards. Once your listing has been updated, it will be added to a Marketplace collection of apps which have similarly enabled UI extensions. Finally, leverage feature flags to release app cards to your install base at your pace and discretion.\n"
