I've created a new function and it's registered in serverless.json (though it's not called from the front end). I have a module.exports in that file that exports the function I'm after. I require that function in my other serverless script. It works perfectly on local dev but not on production. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong? Is this not possible in production?",
