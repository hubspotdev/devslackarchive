A client is having me look at current code they have, where this is being done via a window.location change in the onFormSubmit callback. the analytics between the form submissions and the page views on the redirect pages isn’t matching up, even when filtering out for unique pageviews in GA. My thought is that the onFormSubmit happens post-validation/pre-sending of data, so there’s a race condition between the browser changing and the request getting sent off.\n\nAnyone worked with us, or can confirm that the existing code structure would lead to problems? Or any other ideas on implementation to solve it? We have some other API-intensive stuff we’ve built for them and they’re a fairly high-traffic site so I’m hesitating to make this an API-driven form, though we could run numbers on their request usage if we decide to go that route."
