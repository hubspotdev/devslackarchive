When I send the request with email/firstname/lastname/phone, then I do get a response back, but the properties on the response seem nothing like what is in the doc, and the created contact does not have any fields populated - not even the names.\n\nSample response:\n```{\n    \"id\": \"135851\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"createdate\": \"2022-03-24T07:26:44.982Z\",\n        \"hs_all_contact_vids\": \"135851\",\n        \"hs_is_contact\": \"true\",\n        \"hs_is_unworked\": \"true\",\n        \"hs_object_id\": \"135851\",\n        \"hs_pipeline\": \"contacts-lifecycle-pipeline\",\n        \"lastmodifieddate\": \"2022-03-24T07:26:44.982Z\"\n    },\n    \"createdAt\": \"2022-03-24T07:26:44.982Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2022-03-24T07:26:44.982Z\",\n    \"archived\": false\n}```\nAnd the name fields are blank.\n\nThanks in advance!"

I have extracted all the emails via an API from Pipedrive; however pushing them into HubSpot is a struggle. I saw the “create an engagement” feature of Zapier to log an email; however somehow the field “Meta duration milliseconds” is empty. This causes that my emails don’t have a date stamp.\n\nDoes anyone know here how you can manipulate this field in Zapier or might now a workaround for logging emails in bulk? Thanks!",
