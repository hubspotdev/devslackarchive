I am curious to the level of details required and the QA on the side of HS for these submissions. I know you can't submit a module that is similar to another but I feel like submission like the ones that are currently provide no value to the end user looking at the module for use on their site and look more like a quick placeholder for users looking to update it later so they can gain an advantage on getting that \"we had it first\" spot. Again no offense to the publisher, I havent looked at it or anything like that, just offering a developer opinion on what I am seeing."
