One 'p' element before and other 'p' element after. Do you have similar problem with 'p' element ?\n\nThis is a screen with my problem (please see the first picture)\nIn editor in rich text I have this (please see the second picture)\nThank you in advanced !",

We use webpack and already have minified css and HubSpot’s minification breaks our site.\n\nFor example this snippet.\n```@media (min-width:1080px) {\n\t#site-header {\n\t\tbackground: transparent;\n\t}\n}```\nIs minfied to this with with our webpack.\n```@media(min-width:1080px){#site-header{background: transparent;}}```\nAnd with HubSpots minifyer it’s results in this.\n```@media(min-width:1080px)```\nThat’s because HubSpot thinks that is a Hubl comment."
