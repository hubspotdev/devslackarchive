This Design tab appears to allow any one of those content managers to take the entire page off-brand, with no CMS workflow to ensure review before publishing.\n\nIt would be great to tell our clients “you need to require all of your agencies to ignore that tab,” but that’s not a reasonable expectation in the real world, unfortunately."

If a theme is built without theme settings, then this tab would be entirely disabled. We’re also working on a user permission for editing those theme settings at all — meaning it would be possible for a website to have theme settings, but to block users from being able to edit them unless they have that permission/role."
