It's not a matter of “download images” they are showing as broken links\n\nI tried to retest old email templates that were working 100% and now those too are broken. The file in the files havent been moved but even if they had that should be a problem.\n\nWhen i click on the “view online” link from the broken email i then see all the images. Very odd",
