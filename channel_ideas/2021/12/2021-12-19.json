Instead of doing `{{ some_variable &amp;&amp; some_other_variable }}`, you can do `{{ some_other_variable if some_variable }}` . I would much prefer using `&amp;&amp;` though, thinking about it backwards like that hurts my head. &gt;&lt; But it's what we've got, so just going to have to get used to using it."
