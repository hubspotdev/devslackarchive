I see that to create a batch of associations with the v3 API I need to specify the \"fromObjectType\" and the \"toObjectType\" on the endpoint. But what I want to be able to do is associate a deal with a contact and a company in the same request.\n\nIs this possible with the version 3 of the API or I have to use the legacy associations endpoint?",

Reading API specs and got few questions:\n1. whether it is possible to connect one contact to many companies via API (our tool will be used by accountants, who will use it on for their clients, so initially we want to create a contact (accountant) and many associated companies (clients), who we will be contacting later.\n2. Should we create a company first then the contact or it does not really matter?\nPlease assist or point to the right direction :slightly_smiling_face:"
