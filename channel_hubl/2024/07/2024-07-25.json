    "text": "Hey <@U07E3QVS8PM>.\n• The header HTML is getting added to the &lt;head&gt;-tag which doesn't allow HTML elements like &lt;ul&gt;\n• The Footer HTML is getting added before the closing &lt;body&gt;-tag. Since all of your page content is rendered between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; it accepts HTML elements like &lt;ul&gt;\nJust a recommendation: It seems that you're trying to add a list element (I assume you're trying to implement some sort of navigation listing).\n*I highly advise you not to add* such elements in the footer area. Such elements should be added through your theme and global partials :slightly_smiling_face:"
