This is the code snippet from from Billflow with my edits which their support confirmed is correct.  They also confirmed that they have other customers who have done this successfully, but I thought I’d check here so I don’t reinvent the wheel.  Here’s the code snippet:\n\nconst crypto = require(“crypto”);\nconst *customer_id* = crypto.createHmac(\n   “sha256\",\n   “xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx” // SECRET KEY (KEEP SAFE!)\n).update(*cus_JHkOdbbKq0Tbxx*).digest(“hex”) // PASS THIS TO FRONT-END\n\nI also embedded Billflow’s code in a custom module (so I can reuse this), and it works in test mode.  I am not clear how to call the server-less function from the module and then return the result to the browser.",
