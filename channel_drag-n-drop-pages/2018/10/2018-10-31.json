    "text": "Hey team, we understand the design manager is in Beta, but when customers are used to their drag and drop templates and the v1 modules are forced to be upgraded to be v2 modules in order be edited and to work with other more recent features of HubSpot and the new design manager - us developers are in a catch 22.\n\nWe upgrade the modules and things break and there is no solution to fix it. Recommendations from support have not helped because the customHMTL module in the DaD editor strips out all third party code (i.e. IDX feeds for real estate via &lt;script&gt; .js files). The client doesn’t understand why it doesn’t work now or why they are forced to learn html now in order to update their website that used to be using DaD.\n\nWe believe it is an issue with the new design manager - specifically the drag and drop editor.\n\nWe can clone the drag and drop template to a HubL coded template and then hard code the IDX widget into plain hubL template, but this is not ideal and the client or their team of marketers can’t edit easily.\n\nHas anyone run into a similar issue? And can this be solved QUICKLY?",
