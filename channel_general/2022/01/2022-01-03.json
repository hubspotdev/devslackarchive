    "text": "Hi! *Does HubSpot supports OpenID?* -- We are developing a private app and we use AWS Cognito for login(Planning to make public). We would like to use HubSpot as an external identity provider configured in AWS Cognito so that our customers can login to our app using their hubpot account. AWS Cognito only supports OpenID and SAML based logins. We are aware that enterprise users get access to SAML SSO. We would like to know if the HubSpot supports OpenID so that anyone could signup to our service using their HubSpot account.",
