    "text": "Hi guys! do any of y'all use some tool to sync data over a webhook to a HubSpot custom object? Im in the market for one but most i've been finding (make, zapier, integrately, to name some) does not support custom objects, only the basic contact, company etc object. Happy to hear some recommendations. or am i really looking at a custom solution here?",

    "text": "The developers source of truth should also be version control and not the portal, if you want people working on the same thing then maybe you need a development branch or something along those lines.\n\nWe have the theme branch (in Design Manager) locked and only version control deploy accesses those files. Development portals are a bit difficult if you have to operate with contact, company, hubdb data and of course site settings could be different, and you end up with a bunch of dev portals lying around.\n\nThe way I like to do it now is to have some /dev/username in design manager, and try not to have the files available for new content, also have the theme and stuff clearly labeled development so that some content manager person is not going to litter production with development modules and then it's a PITA to clean that mess up.\n\nThat being said, development portals make sense when working on integrations or some other heavy stuff that would alter important data and so forth."
