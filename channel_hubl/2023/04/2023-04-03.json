I am using \"limit=1&amp;orderby=hs_createdate\"\n```{% set objects = crm_associations(contact.hs_object_id, \"USER_DEFINED\",78,\"limit=1&amp;orderby=hs_createdate\",\"description,amount,is_auto_recurring,campaign,hs_createdate\",false)%}```\nBut this returns the first rather than the last association.  Is that the correct way to do things and how do a reverse the order.\n\nThanks"
