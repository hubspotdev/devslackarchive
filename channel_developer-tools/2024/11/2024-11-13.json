    "text": "Hi,\n\nWe currently offer a CAD download option on our website, but we encountered limitations in implementing a HubSpot form for this feature. Due to this, we had to rely on a form generated directly from our websiteâ€™s backend. We're uncertain if HubSpot is capable of integrating with the external APIs required by our CAD configurator to streamline this process. Could HubSpot potentially support API calls or configurations that would allow it to handle this CAD download function more effectively?"

We haven't received any feedback yet and would really appreciate your insights or suggestions on how to resolve this. Has anyone else faced similar issues or found a workaround?\n\nAlso, is there a *Discord* community for HubSpot? If so, please let us know.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!"
