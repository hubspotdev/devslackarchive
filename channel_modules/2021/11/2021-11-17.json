    "text": "Hello everyone! I have an issue where a deleted module left its assets on the page and I'm getting a conflict now. The issue is with the search input default module which I cloned and edited so that it takes language as a parameter, everything works fine except the old module that existed on the template still has its javascript in the template and I'm getting conflicts like two calls to the api instead of one from my custom module script. Below are some screenshots of the developer info.\n\n<@UGDF9EBPW> maybe you know something about this?\n<@UD53A9UUR> maybe you know something about this, otherwise you definitely know someone who knows about this :stuck_out_tongue:",
