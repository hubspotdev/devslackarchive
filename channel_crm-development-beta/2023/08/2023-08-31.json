It gets stuck probably due to lack of URL encoding. This leaves 2 of my projects inaccessible, whereas I would like to delete them.",

If I upload the project manually with the HS CLI, the build works perfectly fine, but if I use the GitHub automated build it immediately throws an error and shows an endless loading screen in the build details. Same exact setup for either option, one works the other doesn't. I would expect an error message telling me what went wrong with the GitHub deploy so I can fix it :slightly_smiling_face:",

The new UI extensions are not yet available for public apps. \n\nWe are purposefully not allowing iframes right inside the page to keep the experience seamless for end users. You can always show iframe in a modal though.\n\nCan you tell me what are you looking to iframe? And why do you want to use an iframe?"
