    "text": "Yes, we work on blog listing pages with category filters quite a bitâ€“ but it takes some extra pieces that don't automatically come along with HubSpot\n\nThe way we set it up is with a custom module having a HubDB row selector applied as a static module to the Blog Post template.\n\nThis way you can select a HubDB row (in the context of the blog post) which helps add a chunk of data to the post details you can access in the listing template context via `content.widgets['Name-of-Module-Referenced-In-Template'].body.reference_to_field_in_custom_module.id`\n\nKeeping the category configuration with a HubDB helps the client to control the available categories for a blog.\n\nThen we create a blog listing module that loads all of the categories (in the HubDB) as filter buttons, and apply filter functionality to the listing page using URL params and javascript rendering of the posts into the listing page. Here's an example of that: <https://www.komodohealth.com/perspectives>"
