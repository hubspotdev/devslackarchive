That was not the way it was done for this blog. In this case I think someone painstakingly copied the inline styles.\n\n---\n\nI would advise anyone looking to create code blocks like this to follow more what we do on the developers website itself.\n\nWe built a custom module that uses prism.js and prism.css to format HubL and other languages. We escapejinjava and escape all special characters. HubL is  HubSpots version of JinJava, which is based on Jinja. So Jinja syntax highlighting works for HubL."
