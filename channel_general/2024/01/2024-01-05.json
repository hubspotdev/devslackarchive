I'm reaching out for a bit of help with a HubSpot template issue.\nI've been working on customizing a quote template in HubSpot and have run into a warning regarding the absence of the \"List of Future Payments\" feature. Despite having the following segment in my template, this warning persists when creating a new quote:\n\n```&lt;div class=\"payment-schedule\"&gt;\n      {% module \"payment-schedule\" path=\"<@UDA553DRD>/quote_payment_schedule\" %}\n    &lt;/div&gt;```\nTo diagnose the issue, I tried adding a payment schedule, which seems to function correctly.\n\nThis custom template was created by cloning an existing HubSpot quote template, with some modifications to the line_items_table.module, including a few additional lines of code and renaming it.\n\nAttached is a screenshot and the custom module used in the quote template. Any insights, ideas, or guidance from the community would be incredibly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help! :blush:",
