To learn more and sign up for the beta, contact support.```\nThis was working up until yesterday, where I'm now unable to upload new projects to any of my HubSpot portals (I'm a Solutions Partner) - so be it our own portal, app accounts, etc, all are showing this issue.\n\nWe're signed up to the new beta that's popped up in the Products Update section recently, which has since replaced the previous beta you had to be within.",
