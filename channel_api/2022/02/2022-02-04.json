I am being shown a banner in my developer account that my Vidyard videos were copied to HubSpot video 2.0.\nThe problem I'm facing currently is that we built several custom modules for a client using the Vidyard API to create some features (autoplay, buttons to certains points in the video, things like that) and those no longer work. Is there a HubSpot API that might be able to do those same things?"
