Now we see that in the near future we could split our UIE and extract logic and UI into the additional separate UIE cards (the plan is to have 3 separate cards). Our ideal vision is that customers could install our current app from the marketplace and then, during the tab view setup, select the card that they need to display.\nSo my question is, could we do this or not?",
