    "text": "Hey devs!\n\nWe have a brand new module field in beta, that directly connects the CRM with the CMS, allowing marketers to easily render CRM data on websites (standard and custom objects). The CRM Object selector module field allows a developer to create a module for a particular CRM object type, and the marketer is dynamically presented with a dropdown of instances (records) of that object type.\n\nFor example, a developer could create a \"Featured Products\" module that allowed a marketer to select products from their CRM product library for display on their website. Or, if a customer had a Real Estate custom object, a \"Featured Property Listings\" module would allow a marketer to select their real estate properties for display.\n\nInterested in giving it a try? DM me!",
