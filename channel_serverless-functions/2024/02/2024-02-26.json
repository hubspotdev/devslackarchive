    "text": "Hi - hope i'm in the right place to ask. Trying to create and deploy my first project to create a custom CRM card (for the left hand side, not in the middle/tab).\nHas anyone had success in adding a button to said custom CRM card, which can trigger a specific workflow... or any workaround of that? It needs to have the ability to be triggered a few times to re-enrol the contact in the workflow multiple times - it's a workflow that sends contact data via API to a 3rd party platform.",
