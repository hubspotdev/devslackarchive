But they couldn't set up the same emails to be sent from the same app, for development (which will not collect analytics) and for production (which will collect analytics), instead they set up 2 applications and duplicate emails. Is that really how it works?"

I receive:\n\"This oauth-token (CM...) is not valid for this request!\"\nBut it works when hitting other endpoints such as the\n`<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts?limit=10&amp;archived=false>` endpoint.\nI feel and hope it is something trivial. I have just created a new app so I can work with the timeline APIs but this is a real blocker. Any advice is appreciated",
