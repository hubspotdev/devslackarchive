The URL I get from the file manager - is this the one I should use for my image source? In the example in the docs, <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/tags#image> , the image src they use has a cdn domain of `<http://cdn2.HubSpot.net|cdn2.HubSpot.net>` . The image I see in the client’s file manager has a root url matching their domain. Just want to be sure I am referencing the correct image within the template.",
