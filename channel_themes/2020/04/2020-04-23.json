If you’re taking the pseudo element approach, you’ll most likely want to set a background color for a specific section in the template (using the approach that I linked to), and then add pseudo elements in your stylesheet. However, the current drawback to that approach is that a customer won’t have the ability to update the psuedo element colors the same way that they update the section background in the editor, so the section background settings and the pseudo element style may become disconnected."
