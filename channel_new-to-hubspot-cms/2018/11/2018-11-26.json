My experience building sites is mostly CMS-less (jekyll, hugo, django) and managing backend production (git and aws workflow or otherwise). Would love to start a conversation with anyone who is interested on their experiences with HubSpot CMS. Wondering how much dynamic content you folks use, ease of building and deploying all things web, etc. Hit me up here or DM me. Look forward to it!",
