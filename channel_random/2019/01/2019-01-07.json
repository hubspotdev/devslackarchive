    "text": "I get spam calls from this one number almost every week day - fortunately I have a Google Pixel, so instead of me answering they always get the Google assistant. They appear to have software now detecting when that triggers because it auto hangs up. next time - I’m going to answer, wait until it actually puts the telemarketer on the line, then state that I’m the google assistant, and carry on a meaningless conversation with them.\n\n“Tell me more about why you are calling Jon.” “you’ve won a free cruise to -” “is your matter urgent?” “free cruise through the carribean..” “I’m sorry, I can’t find any results for ‘free cruise through the carribean’ I did find one for 5 grand, would you like me to schedule your cruise?” “uhhh…. sure?”\n\n“Okay I’m ready for your credit card number.” “nevermind” “I’m sorry I didn’t hear you clearly, please tell me your credit card number” “cancel”\n“I cannot cancel unless you remove this number from your call list.” *phone click*\n\nThats what I imagine going down."
