    "text": "Howdy folks, I think this might be a back-end Javascript issue. I have CSS rules set up to highlight required fields when the .invalid and .error classes are on them (i.e. when someone clicks “Submit” without filling out the field). This works great for everything except the File type input. For some reason, only for this input type do the .invalid and .error classes not get added if someone tries to submit a form without filling anything in. Is this a backend error that I can’t fix? Can anyone think of another way to add these classes under the right circumstances? My JS knowledge is limited, but I imagine that is part of the solution. <https://d.pr/i/ciOiEY>",

The CSS works fine, but the HTML isn’t changing for this specific input type the way it changes for every other input type. It seems to me like an oversight in whatever JS HubSpot’s forms are built on."
