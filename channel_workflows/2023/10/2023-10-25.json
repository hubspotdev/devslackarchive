    "text": "Hello everyone,\nI set up a workflow that gets triggered whenever a certain deal property is known, runs a custom code and then send an email.\nThe custom code serves the purpose of taking 3 deal properties (of type number currency), formatting them in a special way (that is, having a dot as thousands separator and a comma as decimals separator, with two decimals digits) and saving these formatted values into 3 new single-line text properties, in order to read them as they are in the email body as personalization tokens.\nThe code seems to be working fine except for one of the 3 props: for some reason this prop doesn’t get copied onto the corresponding text prop.\nAny insights about this weird behavior?\nThank you",
