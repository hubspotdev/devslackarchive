Do you know how I can add data layers to track the HubSpot forms?\n\nI also looked at this link <https://medium.com/@dillonjones/the-easiest-way-to-setup-HubSpot-form-tracking-in-google-analytics-a8ad9ab1fc4d> . Does that mean that we actually only need to set it up on GTM with the snippet they included? Or have I misunderstood?",
