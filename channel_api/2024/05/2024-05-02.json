The email is passed in the request string. However, this goes pretty slow if the email has not called before. Anywhere from 5-10 seconds. I'm assuming this is because I'm pulling all the event data. Is there a way to make this query more specific so I can only get email data? I'm willing to use any version/endpoint.\n\nNot to mention I'm getting pretty bad timeout issues with this one.\n\nThanks"
