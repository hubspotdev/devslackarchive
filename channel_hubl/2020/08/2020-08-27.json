    "text": "<@U25PYL3Q8> \"Dynamically\" may not be the most fitting term here, since everything will of course still happen before page load. But as an example you could loop over a HubDB table to create an array of table row data that can then be used as options in a `{% choice %}` field.\n\nSo the list of choices in that `{% choice %}` field will then automatically adapt to the data inputted in that HubDB table. If you add a new table row, it adds a new option. If you remove a row, it removes that option.\n\nI've used this in the past to make it easy for a content editor to fetch data from a specific HubDB table row and render it on the page without knowing the ID of that row. But I'm a bit hesitant to use this technique in client projects since I don't know if passing variables to the `choices` parameter of a `{% choice %}` field is officially supported in the language. I've seen other quirks over the years that turned out to be \"unintended features\" and were \"discouraged\" by the product team :smile:"
