I've seen customers create unique blog instances to represent each category (but this prevents posts from belonging to more than one category.)\nI've also seen HubL tags implemented on the blog template, which allow you to assign posts to a category or multiple categories - <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-tags> - A choice field on the blog template would be a fairly scalable way to implement categories within a single blog (but it would require a fair amount of custom HubL to implement whatever it is you're trying to do with your blog's categorization.)"
