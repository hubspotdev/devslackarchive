With regards to the List API, is there a way to not only retrieve the list membership, but also the date the member was added to the list? Also, if a dynamic list is associated to a campaign, can we pull the campaign name too. Based on documentation, it doesn't look like we can do this, but thought I'd ask in the hopes that there are undocumented features. :slightly_smiling_face: (edite"
