I do already have an email-template and created a custom module (with *programmable content* enabled). However, the problem is how can I access the custom object within this custom module? Is there a way to pass it as a parameter within the email template?\n\nAnother option would be to add some HubL-Code to the email template but this is not allowed via the HTML module? Any suggestions?",
