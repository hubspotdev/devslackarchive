    "text": "<@UUX58C0S3>,\n\nYou can do the following steps:\n\n1. Simply enter any name for a new contact property to view the status of user verification.( Default value would be \"No\" or Null or whatever )\n2  Once a form has been submitted, automatically send the user an email with a button that links to a HubSpot page or another location where an API call can be created.  ( Note : Add a user email as a parameter ).\n\n3  once they have reached the URL Update the user's new contact property (from point 1) to \"Yes\" or whatever you want then  Send them to your thank-you page after an API call is successful.\n\n4  The final step would be to use the new property filter to create an Active contact list that includes only contacts who have verified status.\n\nLet me know if this helps"
