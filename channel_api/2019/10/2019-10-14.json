If a customer is encountering “You don’t have permission to connect this integration” errors, the quick fix is to have a Super Admin do it. The alternative is to list out every permission and make sure the user in question checks all boxes. As such, HubSpotters often opt for the former, although it may not be as technically accurate."

Integrations have varied requirements, so we recommend referencing a given app’s documentation. Learn more about changing a user’s permissions (<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/articles/kcs_article/settings/edit-user-permissions>).\n&gt; If you are still encountering errors after following an integrator’s documentation, please contact support for assistance.\n&gt; Finally, Super Admin roles have every permission an integration may require.
