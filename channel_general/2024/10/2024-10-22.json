    "text": "Hey everyone! I’m new to this community and excited to connect with you all. I’m currently facing an urgent issue while migrating data from Userlist to HubSpot, and I’m hoping someone can help.\n\nWe’re porting over a large portion of data in the form of JSON, with three main categories that contain multiple nested values. The problem is that HubSpot isn’t allowing us to filter companies based on specific criteria within the JSON.\nFor example, here’s a sample JSON:\n```json\n\n\n{\n  \"addons\": {\n    \"File Uploads\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"Clinics Location Service Duration\": \"\",\n    \"Text Messaging\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"Practitioner Mobile Support\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"Insurance\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"Partial Insurance\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"Waitlists\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"Google Analytics\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"Call Reminders\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"Go\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"Booking Labels\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"Packages Membership\": \"TRUE\"\n  }\n}```\nWhen I try to filter companies using a condition like `\"File Uploads\": \"TRUE\"`, HubSpot also pulls in companies that don’t meet this criteria.\n\nIs this a known limitation with JSON filtering in HubSpot, and is there any workaround or solution for this?\n\nI’d really appreciate any insights. Thanks so much!"
