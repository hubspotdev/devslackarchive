If a client has specific needs, that's fine, but it's going to take longer to debug a modern design to fit an old browser like that. that cost should be passed on rather than us investing that additional time into EVERY project when 99% of our sites aren't seeing significant IE traffic"

    "text": "I totally agree with you. The use case that we primarily see a need for this actually doesnt come from visitors like you said but manufacturing clients who have legacy systems built on ie. And their internal teams refuse to update. I def think your average internet users has long since left ie11 but there are still a lot of businesses that rely on it. I think that this last edge update is really the final push to get them off it."
