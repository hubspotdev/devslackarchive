I was building an overly complicated logo hover effect in a codepen, but when I move it over into a HubSpot module, it partially breaks.\n\nI've got an `&lt;svg class=\"clock\"&gt;` and I'm trying to add a class to it on `mouseOver`.  \n\n`$(\".clock\").addClass(\"active\");` is working fine in my codepen, and then not working at all in a HubSpot module.  Anyone else experienced something like this before?  Everything else in the function works as expected... just won't add a class to an SVG",
