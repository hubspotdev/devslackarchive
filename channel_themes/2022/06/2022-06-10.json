    "text": "Thanks Andreas. That sounds like a good plan, but in my case, I would like to stay away from handling the form submission manually since the client will have their own workflow for that part. I would love to hear more about the option with JS and CSS injections, could you explain a bit more? The preview button will basically be just a link to another page, but I didn’t find an good way to put the link next to the checkboxes in the Form, should I define them as the fields of my custom module, and then mapping them via JS, and if so, how?"

When the module is converted (locally) from a global to a local module, each field type group within the module as the toggle in the Editor Options to Prevent editing in content editors flipped on.  I had to go into each group and flip them all off. That did the trick.",
