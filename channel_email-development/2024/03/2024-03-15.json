    "text": "I want to create a page where someone can enter their email address to kick off the unsubscribe process. Most of the guidance I find only discusses the part after email is sent and they arrive at the preferences page. But I'm having trouble with the first page, showing the input box for the email address field.\nI tried using the \"Backup Unsubscribe\" directly on my page but it just shows the -Error message- value, never the input box.\nI also tried making a page with template where the templatetype is `email_backup_unsubscribe_page`. But it seems these template types are not available to be used for pages, only can be used in settings (Settings / Marketing / Email / Subscriptions).\nHow can I complete step 1 of just creating the unsubscribe page for the user?",
