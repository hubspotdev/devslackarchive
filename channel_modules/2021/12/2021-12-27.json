It seems to be still slightly buggy currently, from my initial testing, in that a select input in a module field inheriting a global theme setting value seems to update when you change a global theme setting value, before the actual global theme settings changes are published, but that shouldn’t be a problem for my use-case at least. I haven’t tested it thoroughly or with other field types yet though."
