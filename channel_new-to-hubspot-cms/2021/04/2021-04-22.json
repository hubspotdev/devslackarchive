    "text": "Hello Everyone! I have a quick question. We have embedded our custom HubSpot Knowledge base into our application and are presented when a \"three dashed\" toggle on the top right of the screen. When editing the Knowledge, it's not presented, but when I switch to phone view using F12 it's visible. It seems to be on HubSpot's end, as it's present before even embedding it into our application. Any way to get rid of it? I've been redirected here, so if this not a tech-heavy question my apologies. (I'll attach a image below, circled in red, of what I'm talking about)"
