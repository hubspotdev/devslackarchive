Ideally adding a signature field that someone can sign within a HubSpot form. <https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-signature-addon/> I've pitched the idea of a checkbox line but...no bueno :disappointed:"

I haven’t seen someone do it but theoretically there might be a signature javascript plugin that could take the signature and record it as SVG. and you could pass that code in as a value to say a text input.\n\nThen if there’s a value to that input you know it was signed. and if someone ever needed to recall the signed value you could simply pull the code out and pop it into a text editor and voila the signature"

    "text": "the short, snarky answer: the local developer experience. Open Source and Git are just about married at this point, if we're going to open source a template or module or something, we need a manageable way to develop locally, store our work in repos, and tie into a version control system that allows for collaboration (and ultimately import that asset into our portals). I guess there could be something HS could build, like a shared portal or something (coining the term now.... HubHub. or HubaHuba. GitSpot? working titles) that we could pull and commit etc from our in-browser portals, but I would think the better investment for HubSpot would be creating a way to easily and logically structure projects and tap into the structures already standard in the industry. Just my two cents.",
