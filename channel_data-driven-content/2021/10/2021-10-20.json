    "text": "*I guess I found a Bug!* \n\n*There is a Problem with the default Template Object of Pages that use Widgets*. I know that the widget object only included in the template object if its content is different to the module defaults. But now I have a Blog-Page with a widget (module) and it's published in the past, because it's from an existing blog import. If I check the planner Tab from the editor, the publishing date is not now, it's pointed to a date in a past. So I can't publish recent change until I change the option to publish now. Okay I do that, well now the message in the editor tells me, that my changes are released. But I'm still missing one of the widget object in the listing-template context. The widget is a module, where you can select a HubDB row for additional Data related to the Blog Post. Those HubDB module field change is not recognized as a change from the module defaults, and because of that it doesn't get included in the release, even if it's changed before. So this widget data are still missing in the Listing- and Blog-Page object.\n\nHope you get my point. Thx for noticing.",
