    "text": "Hello, I built a \"Styles\" HubDB that contains a name column (such as Teal Button) and a corresponding class column that refers to a Bootstrap class (such as btn-teal). There are many hand coded modules attached to pages with these styles. Today I got into work and the Styles HubDB is not connecting to live and preview pages, HOWEVER they still work in the page editor. Were there any HubSpot updates rolled out that could have caused this issue? Has anyone else experienced HubDB issues in the last 24 hours?",
