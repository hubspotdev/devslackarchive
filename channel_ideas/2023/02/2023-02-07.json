Just adding safeguards/warnings in the code, I don’t think is enough, it could still lead to confusion. I think it would be nice if there was a Blog post specific field. Or maybe add an option to the Page field to limit the options to only Website pages or Blog posts, and if doing that, maybe also add an option to limit choices to a specific domain (if choosing Website pages), or a specific Blog (if choosing Blog posts).\n\nThis did make me remember some of the reasons why I hate the Page field though."
