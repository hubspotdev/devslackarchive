    "text": "Hello everyone :wave:,\nI’m using HubSpot to perform operations with my NestJS app, and I’m having trouble with a particular method.\nIt turns out that the client wants an email to be sent with a Welcome message when a new deal is created, using a template that is already set up in the UI.\nTo do this, I first need to get the list of email templates that are already created. After looking through the documentation and the beta-docs, I found that it’s possible to make a GET request to `<http://api.hubapi.com/content/api/v2/templates>`. The response returns the following:\n```{\n    \"limit\": 100,\n    \"objects\": [],\n    \"offset\": 0,\n    \"total\": 0\n}```\nI expected it to return an array with all the available templates. Could someone tell me if I’m missing something or if I’m doing anything wrong?\nI’ve seen this issue raised twice: once in the HubSpot forum and the other time in this channel, but I haven’t seen a response yet. Thank you very much.",
