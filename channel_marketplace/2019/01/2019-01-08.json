I also feel any features added by other devs would always stay free unless they themselves wanted their functionality to be part of a paid version.\n\nbesides a paid version I don’t think would be the right way to monetize the extension. I think personally I’d rather have it be a sponsorship. The sponsor would get a “sponsored by company/product name” in the pop up of the extension a callout on the github and the web store description. Preferred sponsors would be HubSpot development related, like other tools.\n\nFiguring out how to handle money with the extension would be hard too - since I personally feel everyone who contributed substantial amounts of work to the extension should be rewarded."
