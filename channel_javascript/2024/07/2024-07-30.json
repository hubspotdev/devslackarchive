    "text": "Hi everyone,\nHas anyone here worked on generating dynamic PDF files, such as an Evaluation Report, that can be rendered dynamically on a HubSpot website? I'm exploring the possibility of using serverless functions for this task.\nI'm considering using the `pdfkit` library for generating these PDFs. According to HubSpot's documentation, it's feasible to include packages beyond their preloaded ones by using webpack to bundle your node modules into the function files.\nThe documentation states:\n&gt; \"If you want to include packages outside of the preloaded package set, you can use webpack to combine your node modules and have your bundled files be your function files.\"\nHas anyone attempted this approach?\nThanks in advance for your help!",
