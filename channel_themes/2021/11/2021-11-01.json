It’s pretty weird, since the same kind of code works for some modules and not for others. File paths are mostly wrong in child themes, and sometimes even in parent themes if you have a child theme created from it.\n\nSo as an example, using this in a module:\n\n{{ require_css(get_asset_url(‘../css/module-1.css’)) }}\n\nand this in another module:\n\n{{ require_css(get_asset_url(‘../css/module-2.css’)) }}\n\nThe problem is the paths in a page created with a template from this child theme containing these two modules are:\n\n…*parent_theme*/css/module-1.css\n…*child_theme*/css/module-2.css\n\nSo one gets the theme settings from the parent theme, and the other from the child theme."
