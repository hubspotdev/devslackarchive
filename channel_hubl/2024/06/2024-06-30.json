Did it a few times in the past.\n\nTechnically you could build this by utilizing tags(name them like \"location_easternsuburbs\") for location and type. The \"when\" could be a custom option.\n\nThe module would be like\n```&lt;ul&gt;\n{% for location_tag in tags %}\n{% if tag is containing \"location_\" %}\n&lt;li&gt;{{location_tag.name|cut(\"location_\") }}&lt;/li&gt;\n{% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n...```\nFurthermore you could use something like isotope.js for the filtering option\n\nAs of the time - you'll need to write some javascript/jQuery to get the current date and pass the \"when\" value to the equation of filtering the events..."
