    "text": "Hello <@U061EJQJ738>\n\nThe error you're encountering seems to be related to the Hub ID or how the request is being processed. Here are some potential reasons for the issue:\n1. Hub ID Issue:\n    ◦ Verify that the `HubSpot_GRATA_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `HubSpot_GRATA_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` variables are correctly set to the client ID and client secret of your HubSpot app.\n2. Refresh Token Issue:\n    ◦ Ensure that the `refresh_token` variable contains a valid and unexpired refresh token.\n3. Endpoint and Headers:\n    ◦ Confirm that the `HubSpot_TOKEN_ENDPOINT` is accurate and corresponds to the HubSpot OAuth token endpoint.\n    ◦ Check that the `headers` are correctly set. In your case, you're using `\"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"`, which is appropriate for this type of request.\n```import requests\n\nHubSpot_GRATA_APP_CLIENT_ID = \"your_client_id\"\nHubSpot_GRATA_APP_CLIENT_SECRET = \"your_client_secret\"\nrefresh_token = \"your_refresh_token\"\nHubSpot_TOKEN_ENDPOINT = \"<https://api.hubapi.com/oauth/v1/token>\"\n\nrequest_body = {\n    \"grant_type\": \"refresh_token\",\n    \"client_id\": HubSpot_GRATA_APP_CLIENT_ID,\n    \"client_secret\": HubSpot_GRATA_APP_CLIENT_SECRET,\n    \"refresh_token\": refresh_token,\n}\n\nheaders = {\"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"}\n\nresponse = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(HubSpot_TOKEN_ENDPOINT, data=request_body, headers=headers)\n\nprint(response.status_code)\nprint(response.json())```"

    "text": "<@U01K3NFJ7U0> Thanks for your detailed response. Actually, in our situation, the refresh token we are tested is an expired token for over 8 days. Our needed is how to refresh and get a new valid access token in this situation.\n\nIf we cannot use this refresh token API when the refresh token is already expired, is this still possible for us get a valid access token?\n\nWe can ask our client to reconnect thru OAuth to get a complete new access token and refresh token, but it is not a good user experience for them.\n\nIn other to avoid the refresh token being expired, should we call this refresh_token API call every 29 minutes? (Assumed the expiration time if the refresh token is 30min.)"
