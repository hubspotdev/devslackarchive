    "text": "Yes, there was for the longest time version 6 or something that was in workflows and npm v was 10 or something. All of the documentation was wrong online and it was super terrible to manage that. now they managed to get this updated so there are two versions (because they changed syntax of the calls — that is why I decided to just go with axios and calls based on the api vs the package so I didn’t have to worry about this anymore"

    "text": "Hi everyone, I have a question about *populating hidden field in HS forms* :arrow_down:\n\nI’ve been trying to populate the hidden field called “marital_status” (just to test it, after that we’ll create a custom field) with the quizz result made in a custom module/javascript.\nHowever, I’ve been debugging a lot and all the logs looks correct but I still cannot see the property populated in the contact’s information.\n\nThe current code is like this:\n\n```// On HubSpot form submit\n// When HubSpot form is loaded\nwindow.addEventListener('message', event =&gt; {\n  if (event.data.type === 'hsFormCallback' &amp;&amp; event.data.eventName === 'onFormSubmit' &amp;&amp; event.data.id === quizz.dataset.form ) {\n    console.log('Form submitted');\n    const results = document.querySelectorAll('.quizz__result');\n    \n    results.forEach((result) =&gt; {\n      if (puntuation &gt;= parseInt(result.dataset.min) &amp;&amp; puntuation &lt;= parseInt(result.dataset.max)) {\n        result.classList.remove('hidden');\n        result.classList.add('result');\n      }\n    });\n    \n    // Set the quiz result in the hidden field\n    updatePuntuation();\n    const quizResultField = document.querySelector('input[name=\"marital_status\"]');\n    quizResultField.value = puntuation;\n    \n    console.log(quizResultField.value);\n    \n    const modal = document.querySelector('.quizz__modal');\n    modal.classList.remove('hidden');\n    prevBtn.classList.add('hidden');\n  }\n});```\n\nAny advice about what am I missing in this situation? I really need to get it ready as soon as possible and I’ve searched in many KB/community but could not find anything that helped me. Thanks in advance.",
