I have created and tested my Hubl template and that works as expected per the documentation. I am now at the part of creating a dynamic page. The documentation drops off here and I don't understand how the Hubl template and the Dynamic page interact. Under advanced settings, I have selected my HubDB table. Past that, I'm not sure how to proceed. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks!",
