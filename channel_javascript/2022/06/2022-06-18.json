    "text": "Hello everyone;\nI have an issue about jquery location and version. We were getting bad result from 'Lighthouse' and I updated the jquery(<https://developers.HubSpot.com/cms/guides/jquery/upgrade#:~:text=Add%20new%20version%20of%20jQuery%20in%20a%20testing%20mode&amp;text=In%20a%20new%20tab%2C%20open,Include%20jQuery%22%20checkbox%20is%20enabled.|here>). But I cant change the location from 'head' to 'footer'. When I change the location, some of the functions (e.g Slick slider) not working. I tried to put all 'slick's scripts' to the page footer but its not working. How can I able to put my jquery to the 'footer' without blocking 'Slick Slider' working?",
