But I cannot access the private apps, is there any permission that needs to be set up other than making my user account a superadmin, or perhaps am I missing something else here?",

    "text": "Hi Dixon, that messaging should probably clearer, but private apps are not available to be used with developer accounts (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/apps/overview|product documentation about app types>). In order to create a private app, you'll need to use a customer account and if you would like to use with projects you'll need an Enterprise subscription to Sales or Service Hub."
