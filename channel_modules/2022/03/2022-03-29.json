    "text": "Hey Fiona, there are a LOT of field options available in modules. For an accordion, the closest option would be a repeater of a group of fields (usually a headline, body text, image, etc…) and for a table you can use the HubDB Table or HubDB Row fields. IIRC some fields are available in the code only (CRM Object comes to mind) but I haven’t built a module in the design manager in a while so I may be wrong there.\n\nHere’s a full list of fields available: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/module-theme-fields>"

    "text": "Hey <@UTQQ4TXCH>, I think I got the same question so I try to provide some clarity. So as you mentioned and tested, a module is able to be used in a template of a different theme by putting in the snipped directly in the template. What I (and maybe also <@UH4V7E3AT>)  trying to do is give content editors also the possibility to use a module from a different theme. The template they use might be from theme A. But they might want to use a module from theme B. I doubt that this is possible since this is more or less against what themes are intended to do. In our case we have a theme from the marketplace (created a child theme of course) and a custom coded one with loads of serverless functions and other stuff we want to keep separated. Any thoughts on this?"
