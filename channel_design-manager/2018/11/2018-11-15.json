Added this CSS\n\n.container-fluid .row-fluid .page-center {\n    float: none;\n  max-width: 900px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n3. Grouped all of the modules I'd like it to affect.\n4. And added the class name to the group ( page-center )\n\nNothing has happened, and I don't understand why. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sjmd_vxYs&amp;feature=youtu.be>"
