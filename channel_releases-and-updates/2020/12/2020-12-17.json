Hope you all had fun.\n\nWhether you won or not, remember your theme is out there on the marketplace. You can keep improving your theme, it’s listing, and it’s documentation making it better for customers and making it stand out from the competition.\n\nWe’ve already heard reports from participants they’ve had some sales, and new clients for ongoing work come out of it."
