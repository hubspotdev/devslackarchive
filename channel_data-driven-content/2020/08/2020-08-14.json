    "text": "so I am creating a hubdb to parse the data via the hubdb json api and i am wondering what the real difference is between making a field in the db a url data type vs text data type. They seem to be the same when I am looking at the json api, like in the wysiwyg the person entering content can choose options like making a url link external or select a pick list of internal pages and also they can choose what ever text for the link not just have it show the actual url. Is that something that the hubdb datatype can do or not?"

They are also wanting some breadcrumb menus that keep track of how deep that have clicked. I see that you can grab a rows parent row using ‘dynamic_page_hubdb_row.hs_parent_row’. Is there anyway to grab up to a tertiary level of parent, or up one aditional level?",
