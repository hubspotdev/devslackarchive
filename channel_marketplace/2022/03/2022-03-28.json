    "text": "WordPress recently introduced <https://wordpress.org/patterns/> and it made me think about how some customers request using their global header/footer on a purchased theme/template. Has there been any thought on how to accomodate someone who wants to add functionality to an existing theme?\n\nBuyer 1: I am brand new to HubSpot and need a theme that contains everything i need.\nBuyer 2: I already have a primary theme with a global header and footer. I want to add more functionality to this existing theme.\n\nWhat if all of these are buyable in the marketplace? You can buy a kit or parts.\nThemes - header/footer - global theme styles\nTemplates - Can be added to any theme. All styles and scripts are scoped or inherit global values. (includes sections and modules)\nSections - Can be added to any theme. All styles and scripts are scoped or inherit global values. (may include modules)\nModules - Can be added to any theme. All styles and scripts are scoped or inherit global values.\n\nIn order for this work I think there would need to be some standardization for themes with mandatory theme style fields and header/footer partials. Then any sub elements can use those values and be interchangeable between themes. This standardization could be optional but if used the asset could have a flag that says \"supports cross compatibility\" OR \"interchangeable\"."
