Is there a way to check up in HubSpot how many times a given URL was shared? Something that, allows you to enter any URL to find out how many times it was shared on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn. Sorry, I know I have opened the same question to the HubSpot community (<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Blog-Website-Page-Publishing/Is-there-a-tool-or-module-in-HubSpot-that-shows-how-many-times-a/m-p/218674#M2044>), but I am hoping I can get a direct answer from here. Or if there is a channel you can recommend that I can ask this question? Thanks in advance :blush:",
