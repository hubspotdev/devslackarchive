    "text": "Hello!\n\nI am constructing an email using custom modules set for programmable email, and I am trying to limit calls to HubDB. What I have done is created one module that makes the HubDB call, gets the table row that I need, and then sets variables based on the column values.\n\nWhat I am trying to do is then access those variables inside of other modules. From what I read you can do the following, for example:\n\n```&lt;img src=\"{{ content.widgets.module_161606177463.body.state_icon_dark }}\" style=\"margin: 0 auto !important;\" /&gt;```\nWhen I try this, however, the image source is not getting populated. I can confirm that the variable in the \"main\" module are getting set correctly, but I can't seem to access them from other modules.\n\nJust to note, the main module that makes the HubDB call is not set as a global module, as I read that content.widgets will not access global modules. The other modules (the ones trying to access the non-global module) are set as global, which I don't think should matter.\n\nHas anyone here successfully pulled this off with programmable emails? And if so, any pointers or examples?\n\nThanks so much in advance, and Happy Friday!\n\nBobby",
