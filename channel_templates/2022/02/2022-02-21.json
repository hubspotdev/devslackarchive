    "text": "Hello. I'm using TYPO3 as a CMS for over 10 years and I did many many HTML templates for it, usually based on Bootstrap. I'm pretty new to HubSpot CMS and I try to understand the logic. I get the idea with the deployment of the Templates but what is still a question for me and I couldn't a proper answer online is. When I take the HubSpot CMS Boilerplate there are already so many CSS rules given and also a Grid framework. Do you build your templates on that or do you add Bootstrap 5 to have all the styles from it and also SCSS support. I'm just curious, whats your workflow?",
