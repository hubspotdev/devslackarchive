    "text": "Hello everyone! I posted this on the <#CD432DF3K|new-to-HubSpot-cms> channel, but was asked to submit it here too. I'm trying to build a simple template partial with one `h2` tag. Here's my code:\n```&lt;!--\n  templateType: section\n  label: Title\n  isAvailableForNewContent: true\n--&gt;\n&lt;!-- Begin partial --&gt;\n{% dnd_section padding={ 'top': '4rem', 'bottom': '1rem', 'left': '0', 'right':\n'0' } %} {% dnd_column offset=0, width=12 %} {% dnd_row %} {% dnd_module\npath='@HubSpot/rich_text', html={{ context.content || '\n&lt;h2&gt;Title section&lt;/h2&gt;\n' }} %} {% end_dnd_module %} {% end_dnd_row %} {% end_dnd_column %} {%\nend_dnd_section %}\n&lt;!-- End partial --&gt;```\nProblem is - I'm unable to publish this because it says that I need to include `{% standard_header_includes %}` &amp; `{% standard_footer_includes %}` and also asks me to add a `dnd_area` tag. When I do that, however, it says `The section can only have one root-level \"dnd_section\" tag`. What's even more confusing is that when I try to accomplish this on my local dev environment, it works just fine without any problems whatsoever, it's only when I try to use the HubSpot platform that I see these errors :thinking_face:"
