The values of theme fields don’t do anything on their own — you have to their value somewhere, and you have full control over how broad or narrow you want that to be.\n\nFor example, if you want a theme field to only influence elements with the class `.special-section`, you can add the theme field and only call it in your CSS for the `.special-section` class."
