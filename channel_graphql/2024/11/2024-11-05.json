    "text": "Hi everyone, I have a couple of questions:\n\nRecently, we encountered a bug that caused a “connection” loss between GraphQL and HubDB. We realized this not only because content wasn’t rendering on the site but also because the “pages” and “pages_collection” tables disappeared from the GraphQL explorer. I wanted to know if this has happened before, understand the reason behind it, and if there’s a solution.\n\nMy solution was to clone the “pages” table in HubDB and point to this new table, but the old one is still there and has completely disappeared from the explorer.\n\nAlso, while cloning tables, I accidentally cloned a few more, and when I tried to delete them, I got an error, even though I’m a superAdmin.\n\nAny thoughts?",
