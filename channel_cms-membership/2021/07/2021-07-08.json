    "text": "Hi people! I have a doubt about how to update contact property through memberships.\nThe use case:\n- I need to set a property of the contact that allows me to track the step in which it is currently, triggered by a CTA or a form.\nThe solution we have found so far was to create all the CTAs, and once the user is logged in, capture that click through a workflow and set a property.\nThen, we bring this property to the front end to render the step where the user is currently.\nMy question is: Is there a better way to do it?\nCan we post information to the contact through a memberships feature? There's any documentation of that?\nThanks in advance for your answers.",
