I am authorising for these scopes: `content, automation, forms, tickets, e-commerce, sales-email-read, crm.objects.contacts.read, crm.schemas.contacts.read, crm.objects.feedback_submissions.read`  Anyone know what the problem is?",

Companies can share a domain.\n\nThat means you would need to look to see if a company exists, and if it didn’t, create it.\n\nThis is my understanding, I could be wrong, but this is how I would do it. Well, I wouldn’t even create companies, I would create contacts, and companies would be created based off that automatically, as HubSpot matches contacts to a company with their email domain. This doesn’t work if you have a bunch of gmail emails, but that is a different edge case"
