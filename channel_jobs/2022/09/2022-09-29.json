Stateless components, React Hooks, and etc...\nAnd also I am familiar with React Hooks. Hooks are comfortable to use and easy to read for engineers as it is functional based. And I can build the functionality to handle API responses in Redux using Axios.\nI use several libraries like TailwindCSS, Material UI, Semantic UI, AntD, Bootstrap, etc.. I do pixel perfect design and it should be fully mobile responsive.\nI specialize in Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga, Redux-Form, React-Hook, Reselect, Context, Axios, and many other useful React/Redux libraries.\n\nCurrently, I am available full-time, and I can start this project immediately.\nKindly reply to this message and let me know when would be a good time for us to connect this week.\nLooking forward to hearing from you for further process.\n\nBest regards.\nJoseph"
