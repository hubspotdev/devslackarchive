Like clicking “Apply” or “Edit Call-To-Action” and you can see it clicking but it does nothing? In addition, I’m seeing the slide out function fails to size properly and is either cutting off a portion of the custom modules fields or just freezing completely. I’ve seen this happening on-and-off then it fixes itself. We’re seeing a lot of instability right now in any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). I feel like I’m going crazy trying to figure out what is our code and what is HubSpot having issues. Anyone else?",
