    "text": "Hi all! I'm looking for some input on how to best handle the issue of module IDs when working in local development with GitHub actions and contentstaging/sandboxes.\nThe issue I'm having is the following\nI'm trying to create a staging environment for our websites using github actions to push to two different themes, one called Web and one called Web Staging. I'll be working on the staging theme and through a github action, I'll push the content into the Web theme once it's ready.\nMy issue however is {% module \"module_48309189302\" path=\"...\" %}, i was hoping i could just use an environment variable in the path to distinguish between Web and Web Staging but it seems I'm required to include the module ID. These aren't the same - so what do I do?",
