    "text": "Hi <@UF0KAKRB8> sounds like this what the Custom Properties are for.  These are not saved as Contact Properties.  One point that might be confusing is these Custom Properties that you see in the screenshot you posted that these are not Custom Contact Proprties, but properties only for this email.  In the JSON to the right of the screenshot it shows where to put those properties in the API call.  you can reference those in your email in the HubSpot by using `{{custom.tracking_number}}` or whatever you want to call your property. Key is that it starts with `custom.`"
