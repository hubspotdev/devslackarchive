The HubSpot recommendation is to use the cli to view it however it’s forbidden to fetch a marketplace theme.  Additionally I can’t right click the json file an copy to the child theme.  The only options on right click for the fields,json is version history file information.  Anyone know how I can view the fields.json?",
