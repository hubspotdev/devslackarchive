    "text": "I know this is a year old now, but I was recently trying to solve the same problem--I was creating an HTML/Hubl template and was trying to set default icon values for a custom module.\n\nAfter trial and error I was able to get it working.\n\nFor Andrey's specific situation, there were a couple things missing:\n1. It was missing a `\"fields={}\"`\n2. and it was missing the icon-set field\nHere is what the working, completed code would look like.\n\n```{% dnd_module \n    path=\"../../modules/icons-block.module\", \n    horizontal_alignment=\"LEFT\",\n    label=\"Icons Block\",\n    fields=\n      \"icons_block_items\"=[\n        {\n            \"icon_block_icon\": {\n              \"unicode\":\"f3c5\",\n              \"icon_set\":\"fontawesome-5.14.0\",\n              \"type\":\"SOLID\",\n              \"name\":\"Alternate Map Marker\"\n            },\n            \"icon_block_text\": \"Icon A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"icon_block_icon\": {\n              \"unicode\":\"f3c5\",\n              \"icon_set\":\"fontawesome-5.14.0\",\n              \"type\":\"SOLID\",\n              \"name\":\"Alternate Map Marker\"\n            },\n            \"icon_block_text\": \"Icon B\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n%}{% end_dnd_module %}```\nHope this helps anyone else struggling with this.\n\nBe sure to check out this page in the documentation for a lot more helpful tips.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/using-modules-in-templates>"
