Is it an error page? Will you call the OAuth callback URL with a failure response? Unsure if there is a new scenario we need to handle in our app and less than two weeks notice on the changes.\n• How would you recommend that — from inside our own marketplace app — we determine if a user has the permission to grant us new scopes? If we add a new feature that requires additional scopes, we need to prompt them to re-install with the updated scopes but now it seems that much fewer HS accounts will be able to do that?"
