    "text": "Hi all, still learning to use HubSpot here.\nI was wondering if there was an easy way to write code blocks within the rich text editor? Currently from what I found the blockquote from the WYSIWYG editor doesn't display code with any particular syntax highlighting.\nI've opted to use Prism.js but that would force people to mess around in the source code of where they are writing so might not be the easiest?\n\nIdeally I would like to not use any external online IDEs to embed into the rich text module but if anyone has any good recommendations for one that you can write bash, python, java and javascript with then I'd be more than grateful :slightly_smiling_face:",
