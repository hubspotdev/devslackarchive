    "text": "Hi community\nHope you all are doing great!\nI have a question regarding the default contact and deal properties managed by HubSpot. Some of the contact properties like \"Became a Customer Date,\" \"Became an Evangelist Date,\" \"Became a Lead Date,\" and \"Became a Subscriber Date,\" as well as deal properties like \"Invoice Due Date,\" \"Invoice Recipient,\" \"Invoice Status,\" and \"Recurring Revenue Amount\" are missing in my new HubSpot account. These properties were present in my previous HubSpot account. Has HubSpot changed how these properties are managed, or do they now come with any add-ons? Is there another way to access them? Please let me know.\nThank you!"

For some reason, when I call the API using the `companyId` with `crm.companies.basicApi.getById`, I only receive the name of the main contact. However, I can’t use it with the *ownersApi* or *contactsApi* to retrieve the rest of the information. Does anyone know how to resolve this?",
