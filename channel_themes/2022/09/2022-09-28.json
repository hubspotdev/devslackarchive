    "text": "Hello Guys,\n\nRecently, I've been facing issues, so I'm hoping you can any assist me.\n\nMy issue is version history; I am currently working on this project and yesterday when I opened the JS file, all the code got removed and reverted to the previous version. This has been happening for the past 15 to 20 days.\n\nI was writing code for *about us page with else condition* when I was working on 26th Sep ( 00:37 seconds), so when I returned to this portal on 27th Sep, I discovered that about us page code had been reverted to *about us without else condition* on 25th Sep ( 00:10).\nIs there anyone who can help me figure out what the issue is?\n\nLoom Link: <https://www.loom.com/share/6e21bf2258cf46e1a0770261e156a136>",
