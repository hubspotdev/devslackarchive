    "text": "Hi guys, I need help. So we are using the workflows for our pipelines, that change the status of a ticket after answering (switch to \"waiting for contact\") or after getting an answer from our customers (switch to \"open\"). So its nice to have that. But the problem is, the process didn't work in the case of a customer, or we opened a new thread in the ticket. So, the workflows seem not to be triggered. We can change the way we answer, but its difficult to change the way our customer answers because maybe the contact has to forward the email to a third person, for example. Does any of you have the same problem or a solution? Or do you have information about why the system is designed like that? Because it seems to be a descision: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/tickets/customize-ticket-pipelines-and-statuses>."
