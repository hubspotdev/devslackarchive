If I add another property to the query, `lastmodifieddate` is always returned and the last one added as parameter.\nIs anyone else having this behaviour? Am I doing anything incorrect?",

    "text": "Hi <@UK277PCMP> I'm able to get back the right response when including all those properties in a request to my own account so the API seems to be working as expected. All existing properties will show up in the `properties` array when using the Get all contacts endpoint. Be sure to read the part in the docs next to the `property` parameter:\n\n```NOTE: Contacts only store data for properties with a value, so records with no value for a property will not include that property, even if the property is specified in the request URL. ```"
