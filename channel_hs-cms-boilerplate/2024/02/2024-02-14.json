    "text": "Hey Markus â€” The icons sets have been updated across the fields/modules, AFAIK. There were a few stragglers but I think we got them all. Regarding the downwards compatibility issue there has been some internal movement,  however, that movement is not yet customer facing. Im not quite sure when it will be customer facing. It is still on the list, though, pretty sure that some higher priority initiatives are taking precedence. In the interim I would still recommend just adding some additional logic to modules that need to swap between font sets as mentioned above."
