    "text": "Hi experts,\n\nI experience a strange behaviour with caching of CMS pages, which show HubDB content. The pages show the content of the HubDB pages via HubL, like shown at the end of the post.\n\n\nPreviously, there was a \"trick\" to disable caching, the use of the HubL local_dt variable. But even this stopped working a while ago, now the page show the current time, but still the old content.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks,\nLuis\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n{% set records = hubdb_table_rows(\"test\") %}\n{% for row in records %}\n&lt;div&gt;{{row.name}}&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/div&gt;"
