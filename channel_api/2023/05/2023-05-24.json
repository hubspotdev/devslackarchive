But somehow the Unix milliseconds created in C# are not accepted but the ones created with Moment (library to manipulate dates in JS) are okay.  Sample code below for C#\n\n```var currentUtcDate = DateTime.SpecifyKind(DateTime.UtcNow, DateTimeKind.Utc);\nvar unixTime = new DateTimeOffset(currentUtcDate).ToUnixTimeMilliseconds();\n\nvar now = DateTime.UtcNow;\nvar unixTime2 = new DateTimeOffset(now).ToUnixTimeMilliseconds();```\nBoth _unixTime_ and _unixTime2_ values are not accepted.\n\nThe unix time from Moment (JS) is accepted though. Sample code below.\n```const format_date_time = \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss\";\nconst format_date = \"YYYY-MM-DD\";\nconst getTime = (date) =&gt; {\n  let formattedDateTime = moment(date).format(format_date_time);\n  let dateOnly = moment(formattedDateTime).format(format_date);\n  let convertedDate = new Date(`${dateOnly}T00:00:00.000Z`);\n  let unix_timestamp = moment(convertedDate).valueOf();\n  return unix_timestamp;\n};```\nError message from Postman\n```{\n    \"validationResults\": [\n        {\n            \"isValid\": false,\n            \"message\": \"1684914035320 is at 7:40:35.320 UTC, not midnight!\",\n            \"error\": \"INVALID_DATE\",\n            \"name\": \"user_created_date\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"isValid\": false,\n            \"message\": \"1684914036292 is at 7:40:36.292 UTC, not midnight!\",\n            \"error\": \"INVALID_DATE\",\n            \"name\": \"user_updated_date\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"status\": \"error\",\n    \"message\": \"Property values were not valid\",\n    \"correlationId\": \"af185936-94dc-4b20-82d0-f385c9ed0123\"\n}```\nAny ideas why Unix time from C# is not accepted?",

    "text": "nah there's not stupid questions <@U051U23LBKP> and I will say depending on what you are trying to do. Is hard to say because I don't know what are you trying to do lol. If you just need the table in some page, you could create a serverless function, add your code there that fetches your data and creates the row. There's a button in the design tools in your portal that allows you to create a new serverless function. Also if you are making an integration you can host your app somewhere. If you want to build a custom module to handle your code with client-side you can just use jquery or vanilla js to make a request to the HubSpot API it all depends on what you are trying to do. I asked the same question before, and although I did not get an answer for it I just try-error and figured what worked for me. It would help if you could tell us a general idea of what you are trying to do, to see if I have done it before and point you the where I would add the code. Here is an example how you can add your code to a custom module:\n\n```{# Custom Module in your theme inside design tools #}\n&lt;div id=\"{{ name }}\"&gt;\n  &lt;div id=\"blogTable\"&gt;\n    {% hubdb_table id_goes_here %}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n{% require_js %}\n&lt;script&gt;\n    HERE YOU CAN ADD YOUR JAVASCRIPT CODE TO FETCH THE BLOGS TITLE\n    THEN CREATE ROW IN THE TABLE \n&lt;/script&gt;\n{% end_require_js %}```"
