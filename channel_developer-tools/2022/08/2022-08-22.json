    "text": "Hello,\nI have a question regarding react development for a HubSpot dev team. I have created a react app for a single page on a website my team is working on, so far I have been creating the backend the modules and react app while my coworker has been working on the frontend of the modules. We are nearing completion and he is able to start working on the frontend / styling of the react app. However, we aren’t sure how he can actually get the react project on his local machine. He can download the compiled build that exists in our portal, but not the project itself. My question is basically this:\n\nHow can my coworker get the full react project that exists on my machine on his and how do we keep our work synced like we have been doing for the modules and templates?\n\nSorry if this isn’t the right channel for this question, but any help would be much appreciated.",
