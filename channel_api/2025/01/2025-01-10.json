We want to make an an API call every few minutes to CourseKey to see if a student has completed a course.  If they have, that respective course gets a closed date in HubSpot and in turn, HubSpot sends a text message with the course code for the next course to the student, so that the student can enter that code in their app and start the next course.  Is this possible in HubSpot?"
