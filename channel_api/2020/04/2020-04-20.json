    "text": "Hello! :slightly_smiling_face: I seem to have encountered something weird when restricting visibility to Deals on a user in a Team. What we are trying to do is hide deals created by an integration from the rest of the users on the portal. We put every user except the user that we will assign the deal to in a Team, and set deal view/edit on the team. It does hide the deals of the integration for all user in the Deals view as expected, but on the contact/companies page where it shows the deals that contact/company have, it is still visible. Is this a expected result or should they be hidden here as well?",
