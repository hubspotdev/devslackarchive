    "text": "Since you aren’t hosted on HubSpot, you can’t use personalization tokens for this (I mention that in case others wan to do the same but are on HubSpot instead of Wordpress).  One way to accomplish this is to use this endpoint <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/get_contact_by_utk> to get information about the visitors to your website from HubSpot. I strongly recommend you cache the results of these calls and not refresh them too often as you can quickly run out of API calls to HubSpot if you attempt to make them too frequently. This would let you know to tell GA to assign the custom attribute of “higher education” to that visitor"
