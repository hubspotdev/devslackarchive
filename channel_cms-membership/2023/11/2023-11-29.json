Afterward, they can log in, use the forgot password feature, etc.\n\nNow, I have a new requirement from the client. If the user is already in the contact list, their email for resetting the password should be sent from HubSpot. How can this be achieved?\n\nCan you please assist me with this?\n\nThank you so much :pray::pray::pray:"
