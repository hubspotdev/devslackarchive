    "text": "Gonna post this here for more visibility - please visit the link and upvote this idea! *One of my biggest problems is refactoring a module or adding / removing fields in the module -- then having to reload all of the content on the page level*. Currently you need to add another instance of the module, copy and paste your content, then remove the old iteration of the module on the page level. Let's see if we can get some upvotes behind this idea so we can have a \"reset\" button on the page level that brings the new module in and keeps the content in place. A HubSpot support person has setup the current idea for us to upvote. He will be meeting with the product team later this week. Let's get some steam behind this so we can streamline updating modules  <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Option-to-Reset-Module-at-Page-Level/idi-p/252089#M29361>",
