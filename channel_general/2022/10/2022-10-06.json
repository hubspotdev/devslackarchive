However on a weekly basis, expect that they will either not work or will be delayed by hours.\n• General access to platform - Oh you wanted your revenue teams to be able to log in? Make sure it's not the day of the week that \"HubSpot is currently unavailable for some customers\"\nWhat the heck is happening there? Is anybody even aware of just how bad and unreliable HubSpot has become in the last 6 months?!?! Stop building new product and focus on making sure the existing product is stable.
