    "text": "This is a fairly standard (and sometimes preferred) link format — omitting the protocol before the `//` indicates that the link should use the same protocol as the referring page. In most cases, this would communicate “continue using HTTPS” to the browser. If a tool is flagging this as a potential SEO issue, that is very assuredly a false positive.\n\nAs to why your links are being formatted in this way: I can’t say for certain, but this type of link is relevant when there are multiple valid access protocols — in the case of HubSpot CMS, that’s going to be HTTP and HTTPS. So, my hunch is that you may not be forcing HTTPS in your domain settings, so protocol-agnostic links would be necessary.\n\nTo check this, go to your settings panel and navigate to Tools &gt; Website &gt; Domains &amp; URLs &gt; [your domain] &gt; Edit &gt; Update domain security settings &gt; Force HTTPS."
