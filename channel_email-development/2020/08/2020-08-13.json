    "text": "Hi all-\n\nA few days ago I wrote on this channel about how to include the featured image of an external blogpost in an RSS email. (See <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/CJ5DN6RKP/p1596607425294900|here>, for reference.)\n\nWell, I'm trying to hodgepodge a template my client can use until we get everything on the HS blog. Template I'm using is here (if you are a HubSpot employee and can access): <https://app.HubSpot.com/design-manager/3404911/templates/33561204132>\n\nI'm also including a screenshot. Obviously, because I have three separate modules so I can line them up with an image module, I keep repeating the same three blog posts. Does anyone know what code I'd put in to point to post 1, 2, 3, etc.? I thought it was \"data-hs-link-id\" as that altered, but no dice.",
