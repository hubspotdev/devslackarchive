    "text": "Hi. I have a question regarding the CTAs. We have a website which is not in HubSpot. On this website you can open an internal page directly in a popup. Now the clients want to use the CTAs from HubSpot. When you create a CTA, you have to choose a destination page which is internal (in HubSpot) or external (websites not hosted on HubSpot). Choosing an external page builds this process:\nCTas on our website --&gt; click --&gt; goes to HubSpot --&gt; grab tracking parameters --&gt; go back to our website with the parameters. Because of this redirect logic, the popup doesn't work. In order to keep the popup function and add a specific tracking to some CTAs, I would like to use the custom events.\nDo you have any better idea?"
