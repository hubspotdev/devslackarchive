In our space this is a significant source of new leads, but we can't credit the events appropriately without them being considered a first touch interaction. We get the leads from these events as a spreadsheet that we import into a list, which is then associated with the event's campaign. There might be some nice bells and whistles available on the Enterprise plan, but for us on Professional it seems like we're stuck doing proper attribution outside of HubSpot"
