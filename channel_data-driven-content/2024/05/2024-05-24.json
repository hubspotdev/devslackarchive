    "text": "Hello everyone! :relaxed:\n\nI'm experimenting something new that I think will be the future of marketing: ungated campaigns.\n\nWe are basically driving traffic from Linkedin Ads to a HS landing page without any form to access it. The conversions on the assets (content/videos) are tracked via CTAs.\n\nThis is the idea, but in practice I am unsure what can/should be tracked in an ungated campaign vs a gated one. :melting_face:\n\n:point_right: *Does anyone here have best practices or state of the art documentation on how to run an ungated campaign in HubSpot?*\n\nThanks!!! :sparkles::pray:"

    "text": "Hi  there, is it possible to use macros in dynamic templates that control the call of HubDB data as parameters? The following code does not work and renders the macro directly for the frontend. Is there any other way to achieve this?  Unfortunately, I cannot use modules because I can only include them but not edit them in the content editor.  All in all, I would like to avoid having to repeat the same code in my dynamic template, where only the query parameters change.\n```{% macro image(parameter_1, parameter_2) %}\n&lt;img src=\"{{parameter_1}}.{{parameter_2}}.url\" alt=\"{{parameter_1}}.{{parameter_2}}.altText\" width=\"{{parameter_1}}.{{parameter_2}}.width\" style=\"max-width:100%; height:auto;\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;\n{% endmacro %}\n\n{{ dynamicContent.image(item,image)  }}```"
