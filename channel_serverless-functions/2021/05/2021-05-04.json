This connector application will first GET the data through other application REST APIs and PUSH(POST) the data to HubSpot app REST APIs. So this will be an additional effort for creating connector application and top over that I need to bear the infrastructure cost for connector application. So I am looking forward to call REST API from HubSpot App to GET the data into custom CRM object. And I think serverless-functions can be used for that but I am not sure. Hope you got the context of my query."
