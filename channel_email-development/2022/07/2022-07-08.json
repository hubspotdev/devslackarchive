    "text": "Hi guys. I hope this is the right place to ask this. I am developing an app and want to use HubSpot e-mail sending capabilities. I know that I can use the API to send either using SingleSend or the SMTP api directly but I am struggling to understand how I should obtain the OAuth token from within my application. I have done the OAuth tutorial but it basically requires a user to login in the browser and give access to the app before receiving the token. Is there any resource where it demonstrates how to obtain the token solely using code? Thank you",
