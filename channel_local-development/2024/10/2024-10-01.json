    "text": "If I want to make a public app and put it in the marketplace do I need my own server setup? \n\nI want to build something that would just require a settings page (think like the settings page the Salesforce integration but much simpler) and I don’t plan to use anything other than server-less functions and ui components like a private app would on hs infrastructure. And the app wouldn’t need to exist outside of HubSpot in any way. \n\nI’m pretty sure this isn’t possible, but would love to know if anyone’s found the “leanest” setup possible for just building cool functionality and distributing it better than an open source private app. ",
