We added the `var _hsq = window._hsq = window._hsq || []; _hsq.push(['setContentType', 'standard-page']);` script to the head and noticed the single quotes are changed to the hex value `&amp;#x27;` in the resulting output. The content type in contact attribution reporting is still coming through as “Page without a content type.” The site is using Next.js.\n\nAnyone have advice about how we can fix it to load correctly?",
