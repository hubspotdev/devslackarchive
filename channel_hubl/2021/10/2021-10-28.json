This means if you use HubL to display immediately on that page something the user just submitted the value may not be ready for the page to display just yet.\n\nYou can adjust for this by using JavaScript to either set a cookie with that value, or change the redirect to include the value as a query parameter. That way you can access it with HubL on the subsequent page."
