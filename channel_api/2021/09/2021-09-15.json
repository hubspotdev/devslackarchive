    "text": "Hello all!\nI have a question regarding the use of the HubSpot api to pull contact data. As a little background information we use Airbyte as the ETL tool (previously we were using Stitch) to transfer data to our redshift instance. It has been working very well for over a month now, but between Thursday (9/9) and Friday (9/10) of last week something changed and we began getting ‘414 Request-URI Too Large for url’ errors. One of my team members said they only added 4 new columns to the contacts properties table but I have no idea if I can verify if that was the only thing that changed. I have spoken with an Airbyte developer directly and done my own research which has made me aware that this is a known error that can come up.\nAirbyte does not allow me to select specific properties from the contacts table, it just tries to pull everything it sees which is (as of right now) 554 properties. Does this seem like an abnormally large number of properties to be handled by the api?"
