    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI asked this a couple of weeks ago, but didn't get a response.\n\nDo CRM action components provide for callbacks? The buttons are great, but I want the extension to trigger another action once the first is done. For instance, I want to associate a custom object with a deal, and then refresh the card (very simplified example).\n\n<@U01NRM1BS3A> suggested using a rollup property to increment the number of associated objects, however, it looks like `onCrmPropertiesUpdate` doesn't get triggered by a change to the rollup property because it's not being changed in the UI.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions, or know how to implement a callback function on a CRM action component?",
