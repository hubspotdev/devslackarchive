    "text": "Hi Team, hope your week-end went well!\n\nI faced a problem implementing the HubSpot API.\n\nThe goal is to update some field on my companies, I want to use the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/imports?_ga=2.199278446.1753207875.1595838474-1533911020.1595601878|bulk import> but it seems like I can't update companies like that.\nCalling companies by domain or name create new ones and calling them by their ids just don't work, using hs_object_id : (FAILED_VALIDATION,COMPANY,\"Property value 'XXXXXX' isn't valid (from column 'ID')\").\n\nI know I can use previous version API to get and update companies one by one but it's a scheduled task (CRON) and I need to optimize the number of requests.\nIs there any way to use bulk import for this specific case ?\nPlease let me now and have a nice day :slightly_smiling_face:",
