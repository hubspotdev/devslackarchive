    "text": "Hey guys. I'm working on an email module that will pull a random image from hubdb and insert it into email (I would like to be able to send a different image for every email sent).\nI am trying something like:\n```{% set randomImage = (hubdb_table_rows(module.hubdb_table)|random).image %}```\nand then inserting the image info into a linked_image module.\n\nThe problem I am experiencing is that I always get the email with the same image. I think the email content is being prerendered and cached somehow. Can someone please explain what is going on ant point me to the solution :smile:",
