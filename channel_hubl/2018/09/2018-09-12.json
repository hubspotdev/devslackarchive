    "text": "Good morning (or good evening wherever you are :wink: ) I have a question that I think someone might be stumbled upon already. In a blog post, I'd like to have two different images for the feature image (the one that is used in links, Open Graph) and the hero/main image on the site itself. I think it would be great to have second variant with the title in the feature image, like other blogs are doing it (e.g. moz <https://moz.com/blog/absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-analytics>)\nAny help is much appreciated. You guys rock!",
