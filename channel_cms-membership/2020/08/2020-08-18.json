    "text": "hey question for you all. working on a site with memberships where we have two different sets of memberships. membership to pages \"A\" and membership to pages \"B\". We have lists running to control the audience and they do not match (they are entirely different lists for A and B).\n\nHowever, when someone is signing in, they apparently now have access to both pages tied to A and B.\n\nWe created A awhile back and it worked well, but when now that we've created B, we're finding that people who never were added to A can access it.\n\nAre we doing something wrong? or is this supposed to happen? Essentially it's like an idea of creating an LMS for a client where the users can purchase several different courses, but only have access to those they purchase. It will defeat the purpose if you can purchase one time and have access to everything haha."
