Some of us have been devoting a lot of time towards another project, and just haven’t been able to devote enough to CrankShaft. The project is not slowing down, just many of the contributors have been working on throwing an awesome Developer focused event - taking place during Inbound week.\n\nAre you a developer? You’re invited.\n\nWant to stay connected to this event - join: <#CCGU4R4ER|extend>\nAfter that head on over to\n<https://devday.splashthat.com>\nfor more information. We are so excited to see you there, and if you can’t make it, we plan to live stream."
