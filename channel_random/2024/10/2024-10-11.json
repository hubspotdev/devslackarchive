This is where all your page templates, including headers and footers, are stored.\nFind the template that's linked to the page you want to update for your private content. Once you're in the right template, look for the section with the logo, usually under `&lt;header&gt;` or `&lt;div class=\"header\"&gt;` tags.\nLook for an `&lt;img&gt;` tag that has the current logo's URL. To change the logo, replace the URL in that `&lt;img&gt;` tag with the URL of the new logo (you can upload the new logo to your HubSpot file manager).\n\nLet me know if this works or not. Thanks!"
