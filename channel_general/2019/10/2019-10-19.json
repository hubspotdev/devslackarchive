Go on mobile (by android or by using Chrome debug tools) and you can see that clicking the + and then a child item works fine. Click the \"Company\" or \"Resources\" parent item in mobile and then attempt to click a child item. It collapses and doesn't navigate properly. The best I can tell this is a conflict with the tutorial code and the flyout code."
