    "text": "Hey HS Staff I have a page that has a lot of HubDB queries going on because there’s a lot of crazy data organization and filtering going on. Most of the queries only actually fire under specific conditions and can never all happen at once.\n\nAnyhow I was wondering if there’s a way to temporarily raise the limit for this one page to buy us time to restructure the code to avoid this. The page suddenly broke due to the query rules kicking in right ahead of Thanksgiving killing our ability to solve the problem ahead of time.  We would only need until Friday of next week.\nHappy Thanksgiving BTW!",
