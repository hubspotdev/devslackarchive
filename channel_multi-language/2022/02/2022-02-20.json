As you can see on a normal page we will have this edit interface, where we can use the language selector, and then click the module we need to localize and finally key in the content.\n\n\n\nBut it's not the case with the system pages like Login, Reset password, Set password, etc.\nBasically, all the URLs that have this structure <http://domain.com/_hcms/path>\n\nI'm aware that we can hardcode it at the template level. But that will be the last thing we will do. \n\nis there any option to enable edit page on these system pages? or is there any better solution to localize system pages?\n\n2. We have a scenario where the user comes from the Login page (in Chinese) and then after the successful login, the user is redirected to the English home page instead of the Chinese home page as we expected. is there any way to override this behavior to make sure that the login redirect will always point to the same language?",
