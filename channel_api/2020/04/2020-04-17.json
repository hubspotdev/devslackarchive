    "text": "Hi all - New to this channel. I am trying to use the API for searching Contacts with a first name or last name containing part of the names. It looks like *CONTAINS_TOKEN* expects the full word and not part of it. Is there any other alternative to accomplish what I am trying to do. I also tried using query=\"abc\", but that seems to return results from unused properties or properties that were updated later on, thereby not giving current and useful result.\n\nAny help is much appreciated.\n{\n    \"filterGroups\":[\n        {\n            \"filters\": [\n                {\n                    \"propertyName\": \"firstname\",\n                    \"operator\": \"CONTAINS_TOKEN\",\n                    \"value\": \"kuma\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"filters\": [\n                {\n                    \"propertyName\": \"lastname\",\n                    \"operator\": \"CONTAINS_TOKEN\",\n                    \"value\": \"clint\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}"
