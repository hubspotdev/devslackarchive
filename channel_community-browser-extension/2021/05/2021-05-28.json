    "text": "Hey all, it just came to my attention that in chrome 91 the extension suddenly has a strange width glitch that occurs squishing the content of the popup.\n\nI won’t be able to fix this myself for a bit and to do so I have to do a little extra legwork since this is technically not a HubSpot owned project. So anyways it may be a little bit.\n\nA temporary workaround is to inspect the popup, on the body tag a `width` attribute appears. Toggle the style off, then back on. Doing so for some reason resolves the issue.\n\nThe project is open source and if you’re willing to take a stab at fixing the issue, feel free to throw up a PR.\n\nThe file that needs updating is: <https://github.com/TheWebTech/HubSpot-Developer-Extension/blob/master/popup.html>",
