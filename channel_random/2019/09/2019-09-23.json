The features we need from Uberflip would be to create a content hub for our internal customers/sales team to search all our content by keywords or topic. Also the ability to create custom content \"streams\" on the fly for prospects.\n\nIn my searching, I haven't seen anything that comes close to offering the same functionality :disappointed:"
