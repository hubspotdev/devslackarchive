It might be worth tracking down the `content.post_summary`  or `content.post_list_content` variable (whatever renders your post description) in your listing template and adding the `truncatehtml`filter (docs <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/filters#truncatehtml|here>). It should close any stray tags."
