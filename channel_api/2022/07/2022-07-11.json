I am going to pull data from HubSpot Acct using CRM API v3.\nWhen I pull Deals, I was going to pull the associated Company together with Deals. That's why I used this api.\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/deals>  (first screenshot)\nI was expecting I would get the Deals with associated company. However, I didn't get the associated company, but only got Deals list.\nHere is the response of api call - second screenshot.\n\nI'd like you to check it out and let me know what's wrong.",
