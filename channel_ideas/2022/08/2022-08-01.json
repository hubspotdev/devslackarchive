    "text": "Hey all. Quick question. I find a limitation for HubSpot in blogs is that you only have tags so unlike WordPress you don't have Categories and tags to work with. Having both helps you to filter down content you are looking for and give you additional options for feeding a collection of posts into a module instead of just a certain tag.\n\nDoes anyone know if or have had success with using the Campaign field as like a \"category\" that you can set up and use it to pull blog posts?",

I would advice against using the campaign field for that... if that is not properly documented and communicated, i am sure it could cause a lot of trouble in the future.\n\nThere is also this Blog Post:  <https://www.gonzalotorreras.com/blog/sub-categories-in-blog-posts> from <@U7ADCU3BM>"
