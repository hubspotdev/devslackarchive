This affects all pages you are currently hosting on HubSpot.\nIf that is too much, you can find a similar section for each page in the settings tab of each page.\n\nIf the code needs to run before the page is loaded, you would add a script in the head that generates your body element and append it to the body.\n\nIf the code can run after the page is loaded, the footer option would be preferred as it is not blocking the rendering."

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.
