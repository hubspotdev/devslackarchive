    "text": "Thank you all for your patience and flexibility this week as we try to navigate the difficult decision of launching themes in the Marketplace. I appreciate all the feedback we’ve received on our approach and will continue to leverage it as we move forward. \n\nAfter much discussion and initial feedback, we have decided to launch the Marketplace storefront experience for themes on June 25. As we approach this date we will continue to check in with you, providers, our customers, and our internal teams to make sure this is the best timing for all involved. \n\nFor those of you who were notified last month of stale assets removal, you may have noticed assets that had not been downloaded for 180 day weren’t removed on June 1. Instead we will be rescheduling the removal of stale assets to 7/8. If you have any questions or feedback please feel free to reach out."
