I would recommend in your advanced menus to simply use span tags with classes assigned in the labels to make this function as you need. Ideally, you would want to recreate your menu using the `menu()` function as that would give you way more control on the output of the code of the menu and in return, the ability to assign classes directly to the `&lt;li&gt;`'s"
