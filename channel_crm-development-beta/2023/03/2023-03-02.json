    "text": "Hi (this is crossposted from <#C011F74BKQW|serverless-functions>)\nI have a question regarding accessing an external API within a CRM Extension.\nI need to generate a JWT token in order to authenticate my calls to the external application. However, in order to generate the token, I need a specific library (using jsrsasign from <http://jwt.io|jwt.io>). So I have two questions:\n• is there a standard way to authenticate to an external API using JWT (so I don’t have to reinvent the wheel)\n• if not, how do I import an external library in a serverless function environment)?\n",
