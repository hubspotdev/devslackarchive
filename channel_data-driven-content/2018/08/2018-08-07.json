Need to display tons of custom data on your site like a staff directory? a store location finder? your favorite sci-fi movies ordered from 1 star to Back to the Future?\nHubDB it’s got your back.\n\nYou can pull values via HubL - see HubL description - you can pull em via javascript. All with simplified Google Docs like direct editing of the tables. Need to update the tables automatically? There’s an API for that. Need to import a csv with over 15,000 rows, theres a UI for that.\n\nThink you’ve found something HubDB can’t do? Yea right, <@U6GNQ7JBU> just released that feature yesterday. #robot #wizard \n\nHubDB GET IT!",
