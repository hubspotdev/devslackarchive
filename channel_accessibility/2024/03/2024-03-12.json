To my understanding, you shouldn’t really ever need to add `aria-label` a link if the element’s contents are sufficiently descriptive. There’s a good chance you don’t need to do this at all.\n\nScreen readers should already announce the text content when the link is selected. Adding an `aria-label` with the same content would just make it announce the text content twice, which I would consider to be a degradation of experience."
