Use encryption: Use encryption to protect sensitive data that is transmitted over the network.\n3. Validate input: Validate all input to your API to prevent injection attacks and other types of security vulnerabilities.\n4. Monitor your API: Monitor your API for suspicious activity and unusual traffic patterns.\n5. Keep your software up to date: Keep your serverless function and any dependencies up to date with the latest security patches and updates     <https://blog.HubSpot.com/website/api-security>"
