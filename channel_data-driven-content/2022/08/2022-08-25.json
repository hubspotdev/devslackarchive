    "text": "Hey GraphQL BETA developers!\n\nI wanted to inform you all of an update to the GraphQL schema that we are going to be rolling out on Wednesday, August 31st, at 11am EST. Currently, HubSpot User type properties just return an ID of the user. We will now return additional properties of users, so you may need to update code that uses fetched data to specify which property of the user to use. Queries for HubSpot user type properties will get returned like this:\n```...\n\"HubSpot_owner_id\": {\n  \"owner_id\": \"120552061\",\n  \"firstname\": \"William\",\n  \"lastname\": \"Spiro\",\n  \"email\": \"<mailto:wspiro@HubSpot.com|wspiro@HubSpot.com>\"\n}\n...```\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!",
