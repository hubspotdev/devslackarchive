    "text": "Hi Max, I'm not sure about capturing the entire user journey and passing that info to HS, because no one has ever asked me to do that before, but I have been asked several times from different clients about the same thing you are describing with the ads, where someone clicks one and then navigates around the site before filling a form in. I have found the best way to to handle that is to set a cookie for the user that contains the UTM parameters, then pass the cookie data as hidden form fields, and then finally map them to your CRM (HS in your case, but I have also done this with marketo and SF). This method has been successful for me, so I hope it helps you!"
