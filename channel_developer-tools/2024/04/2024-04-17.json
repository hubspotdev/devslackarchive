    "text": "HI everybody, I am new here so I don't know if this channel is the right one. But I am just going to try and maybe someone can point me in the right direction.\n\nFor my client I am looking to connect their externam phone provider with HubSpot.\nIn order to do that they need an API connection. But since API Keys are no longer available I am trying to set up an app.\nHowever I am not sure how to set up the app and what to select in order to get it to work.\n\nSo basically, my client wants to use the phone provider to make calls via HubSpot with the current phone provider.\nAlso receive calls. So we can log the calls in HS when they come in.\n\nInbound calls\nOutbound calls\nAnswered calls\nUnanswered calls\nRecording uploads\n\nCan someone help/instruct me how to set up the app so I can send them the right info to make the connection?",
