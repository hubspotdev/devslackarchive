There are marketing courses though that may be of interest to you on <http://academy.HubSpot.com|academy.HubSpot.com>\n\nSince you said you stating html, js,css files your options for using them on HS are basically learn HubL, the design manager, HTML, CSS, JS and then convert the files over to HS. the majority of the changes will be with the html file. the other two may not need much real change."
