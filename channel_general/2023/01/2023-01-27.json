    "text": "Hello all, I have a design that I need to be turned into Hubl, all is straightforward apart from the Knowledge base section. Apparently, the design of the knowledge base can be slightly modified (I dont know if anything changed in the meantime and I can fully customize it). My main problem is related to display a feed of the latest knowledge base articles on the home page. The website is on <http://domain.com|domain.com> while the knowledge base is on <http://learning.domain.com/knowledgebase|learning.domain.com/knowledgebase> &gt; on the <http://domain.com|domain.com> I need to showcase the most recent articles added on the knowledgebase (similar like I would do it for a blog/blog feed). Please advice. Thank you"
