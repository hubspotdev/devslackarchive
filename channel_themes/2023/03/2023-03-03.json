Currently referring to <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes/custom-fonts|this documentation> for the steps, but when I get to the theme preview, I'm able to select the font in the typography dropdown, but it doesn't necessarily get applied and uses the fallback font or something. I've double-checked the naming and font path in the font.json and theme.json files, but nada. Any ideas?",

On my development environment, it’s working 100% as expected, including in the page builder.\n\nIf I poke around with the element inspector, I see an empty value where the font name should be. I’m frankly a little stumped — it feels like it can’t be my fault given the incredibly specific context in which it fails, but I’m welcome to any and all suggestions as to how I might be able to solve it.",
