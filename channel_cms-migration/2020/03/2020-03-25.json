Although it's difficult to say exactly what went wrong, here are some hints. It is preferred (but not required) for your posts to use the post_type \"post\". If using a custom post type, please ensure post items contain the standard elements for: author name (usually \"creator\"), publish date (usually \"post_date\" or \"publish_date\"), post body (usually \"content\"), publish status (usually \"status”)"
