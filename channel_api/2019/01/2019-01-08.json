Pulling these will give you the pre-rendered structure of a page created in-app. Coded files are not accessible from the Layouts API.\n\nA 'template' is the actual html template used to render a webpage. Pulling these gives you the HTML and related metadata used to render a page. Coded files are included in the Templates API, and you can programmatically create templates here too."
