    "text": "Hi Binod, I ran into the same issue when trying to integrate Zoho Projects with HubSpot which requires a new token to be fetched each hour. As a work around I did store the key within a draft HubDB table (not publicly exposed) which still requires your HubSpot API credentials to access and modify. Only issue with integrating the keys this way is that anyone with access to the table within HubSpot can both see and modify the key so would depend on your use case internally as to if this is an issue or not. Alternatively if you do require the storage of the keys within HubSpot but don't wish to have them publicly seen by users in your HubSpot account you could apply an encryption key to the API Key when it is fetched and store the encrypted API key in a draft HubDB table and only decrypt the key when its needing to be utilized, this way you can store the key without having to worry about users in your HubSpot account using it. But I am sure others would on this slack have much better ideas to approaches."
