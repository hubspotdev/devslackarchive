    "text": "I'd go with HubDB, put the author data in some table, you could have them in some spreadsheet and then import data – author images are a bit difficult to import though b/c you need the files *somewhere* but I think it's a coin toss if it's worth it to build some API thingy to upload image, get it's URI, then do a HubDB update with the author data instead of doing that thing manually.\n\nOf course if the images are hosted elsewhere then you'd just use that URI in the data.\n\nHubDB takes in CSV imports so if you need it done by Friday I think it means leg work. Also tell someone that Fridays are not good launch days. Tuesdays are good. Then you try to get it done by Friday, and still have Monday to do some testing and final adjustments, and most of the time Fridays no-one cares about your thing...\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/cms/hubdb>\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/files/files>"

Especially after Squarespace, lol.\n\nSo, I’m wondering how easy it is to find a project on HubSpot CMS and what is the average hourly rate for developers.\n\nFeel free to DM me.\nThanks.",
