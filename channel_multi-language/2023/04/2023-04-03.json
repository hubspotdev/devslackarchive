    "text": "Hi there!\n\nI am working on a quote template. In particular, on a 'child' template of the CMS theme 'Modern'.\nI am having problems with the translation modules. When I apply custom translations to certain modules, they are not applied to the quotes created. In the module preview it does apply the changes, but not on the quotes (linked to the Modern CMS child).\n\nI change the language of the quote template linked to the CMS child theme to reset all the quote values and put the corresponding language back.\nAfter doing these steps, the translation is still not updated.\nI don't know if the problem comes from the cache, or if there is a problem between the 'parent'and 'child' template.\n\n Does anyone have this problem?",
