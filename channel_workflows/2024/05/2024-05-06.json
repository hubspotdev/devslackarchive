    "text": "Hello Everyone!\n\n*I have an issue with forms containing with a multi select property and a workflow that sends internal email notifications to different users.*\n\n*What I am trying to achieve:* When a user selects multiple options from the multi select, the workflow can then send internal email notifications to different teams based on the selections.\n\nExample: Multi Select\n• Partner\n• Customer\n• Other\nI have not been able to achieve that. I tried an *if then* branch and it killed option 2 & 3 when any of those is selected and - 2. Tried to use a Value branch but goes to none-met as multiple selections are selected.\n\nI appreciate your help in advance! I am looking to resolve this in the most efficient way!",

First branch you check if criteria is met for partner, then for those that match “partner” will get the internal email, both branch then go into checking the next option..",
