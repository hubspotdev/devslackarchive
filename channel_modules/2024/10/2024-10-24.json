    "text": "Hi,\nI built a custom module and added field variables. I grouped some of the variables and was able to access them in the html no problem. After this I tried to add a couple of new variables within some of the groups. When I hover over the slug value, I am unable to copy the value. I tried accessing the newly added variable in the html, but it's not included in the group. I've logged the group and only the previously added variables are included, none of the new ones are showing in the log. How do I fix this so that I can add a new variable to an already created group and access the variable in the html?"
