    "text": "Hi!\nHoping someone can help me on this.\nI am trying to combine my existing blogs (5 different languages) into one multilanguage group (primary - English). The others have been live for at least 2 years and a lot of link building, backlinks, SEO work etc.\n\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/blog/create-a-multi-language-blog>\nAfter reading this article I have tried to do all the steps and I am now at the \"combining them\" part. There is a note saying: \"Please note: changing your blog's language will update the URL structure of your blog to include the updated language slug. Redirects for your existing blog URLs will be created automatically.\".\nSo my question is, if I do this, will this affect our ranking, SEO work etc? Has anyone done this before and is it an efficient/smooth process?",
