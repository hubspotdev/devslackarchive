    "text": "Hello everyone! I'm thrilled to be here; I started with HubSpot a couple of months ago, and I've managed to earn three certifications already. I'm doing the GDD right now and I'm really impressed with all the new information I'm receiving. \n\nI'm new to programing and digital marketing and I love it, I'm in a major turn in my career and life in general and I'm so exited that HubSpot is part of this. I'm hoping that this new begining becomes a new life of successess. :metal: \n\nThe CMS is kind of intimidating although it looks simple.  It's very flexible and I have some questions; I'll post them once I exahust the online documentation.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nDavid",
