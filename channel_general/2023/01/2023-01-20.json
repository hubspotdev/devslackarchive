    "text": "Hi I was sent here by HubSpot help as they didnt seem to have any information. I have various dev accounts to test my app integration. Some are for manual tests and others are for integration tests which i dont want to mess about with. I recently got an email for all of my dev accounts saying:\n\n\"Your HubSpot plan has changed and doesn't allow primary Email, Knowledge base HubSpot (system) domains, so you'll need to head to Domains &amp; URLs within 89 days to remove them. Or, if you do nothing, on Apr 19, 2023 we'll automatically remove them.\"\n\nproblem is that I cant really understand what it wants me to do as I do not have any domains registered on these accounts...\nI might just be misunderstanding what it wants me to do so please clarify if you have any ideas.\n\nThanks in advance - also apologies if this isnt the right place to be posting this.",
