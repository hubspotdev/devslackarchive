My client has various domains that are Wordpress sites. I’d like to be able to possibly send the cookie data to the api and it somehow identify the and return their HubSpot properties (via api call most likely I would assume)\n\nIs something like this possible, if the user’s cookie knows that it is a contact in HubSpot??"
