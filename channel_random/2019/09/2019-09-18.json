    "text": "yea it’s on my radar see <#CBBAW6Z3R|community-browser-extension>\nA feature that is disabled required additional permissions. There is nothing taking advantage of the permissions right now.\n\nI plan to get that resolved this week. just have not had a chance yet.\n\nThe additional permission slipped in with an update I made that fixed a ton of bugs and brought beta and stable channel up to parity.\n\nIntent is not to ever request that permission but make it optional, and make it so that if you do not use that permission you can grant a permission on an individual site basis. For context this is related to a feature that grabs developer info for the current page, so you can use that information easier"
