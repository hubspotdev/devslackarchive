I tried searching docs but with little success\nI got webhook subscriptions in my app and I’m trying to identify which account did those events originate from. AFAIK in the event there’s `portal_id` or `app_id` but from what I can see the ‘account’ actually correlates to `hub_id` (which isn’t available in the event data)",

Deal is just a single deal with required properties. However lineitem is a batch of different product. I want to create association between those two. After some research if I guess correctly since the way I create lineitem, lineitem will be return as array so I have to associate them 1 by 1 (Please Correct Me if I am wrong) However after running above code I get\n```Error: Required parameter toObjectType was null or undefined when calling create.```\nCan someone help me and tell me what's wrong?"
