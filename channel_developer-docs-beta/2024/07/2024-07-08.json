    "text": "Hi all, very belated closing the loop on this thread.\n\nIn short, it is not currently possible to reliably associate tickets and threads.\n\nThere's actually a disconnect between us in Inbox/Help Desk land and the decision from a CRM API team to publicly expose some new association types, and whether those types are helpful vs confusing.\n\nWhat it comes down to is that\n1. The Conversation CRM object is not a first-class HubSpot framework CRM object, and thus is not publicly addressable via API (and there are various reasons why this should continue to be true)\n2. The object ID you are getting back on `ticket_to_conversation_v2` is _*not*_ the same as the id of a thread from the GET threads endpoint in the conversations API.  Though the text contents are the same, a 'thread' in the conversations platform isn't exactly the same entity as the CRM Conversation object around the same contents.\n3. Indeed, `ticket_to_conversation` is a legacy concept.\nThe way we are thinking about solving for this as we plan out moving the Conversations API towards general availability is to do it within this API and not have to rely on the Associations API. Something like\n• Add an `associatedTicketId` property to the response on thread endpoints\n• Add an `associatedTicketId` to parameter to the filter query on thread endpoints \n"
