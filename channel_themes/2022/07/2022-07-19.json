    "text": "Hello, quick question - one of our clients wants to find a hero module to use with their HubSpot boilerplate theme. Is it possible to purchase modules in the Marketplace to use with themes like we used to with Templates? I have  not found anything yet so I suspect the hero module must be custom created in the design manager. Thank you for any insight you have to share!",
