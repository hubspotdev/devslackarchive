    "text": "It appears that the current version of Node used to build projects on HubSpot after upload is v16.20. I cloned the cms-react repo and used Node v16.20 to do `npm i`. This generated a lot of package compatibility errors especially for Vite. I tried adding an `engines` entry to the package.json file with “&gt;=18” to see if that would cause the upload build/deploy to use a different node version - it did not. It looks like LTS/gallium is no longer in “maintenance.” Is there a plan to upgrade the node version used to do builds?",

We have been working to move our Build and Run environments for CMS React to Node 20 in recent weeks. At this time the Build environment is now Node 20. Any new builds will also result in a Run environment which is Also Node 20. We do not anticipate this should cause the need for any change in how you all are developing, but as always please let us know of any issues you encounter."
