    "text": "(Mac User) I've setup a local environment and now need to fetch changes that were made in HubSpot since my local environment was created. I tried using what the fetch doc says \"hs fetch --account=&lt;########&gt; &lt;/my-website-theme&gt;[dest]\" and I get this odd error \"zsh: parse error near `&lt;'\" I tried every combo I could think of and finally was able to do just \"hs fetch /my-website-theme\" no account number if I try to add the name it says doesn't exist. So if I back out one one directory and run the bare hs fetch /file-path it overwrites it and I'm good to go unless I have made local changes. Can anyone explain to me what is happening and what are the best practices. My thought is to always push to my git for a backup (beginning of day) and always push at the end of the day and just pull and overwrite in the morning.",
