See below.\n\nFor workflows, I'd also tackle the associated objects like forms, ctas, custom properties, etc and ensure the linking is proper and accounted for when migrating it over. Auditing the current workflows you have and identifying and custom properties/etc you'd need to create in the new portal that would be associated with the workflow. youd need to configure the properties and stuff first so that the pipelines will be properly built when things are moved over."

Unless it's a contact based workflow and even at that it's pretty complex due to things like enrollment triggers (are all the property cloned, form submissions (impossible to bring over), and other stuff like that).\n\nTLDR: you can get all workflow but only create contact workflows and even that is pretty complex"
