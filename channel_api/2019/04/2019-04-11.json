    "text": "<@UDU6KEBFB> I think it is really about what your preference is/what you'd be comfortable with. Node.js is a great back-end programming language especially if you're already comfortable with JavaScript. As an added bonus for Node.js, you can currently use Node.js for code snippets if you work with the bots tool at all (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/bots/running-code-snippets>). On the flip side, Python is a definitely one of the easier back-end programming languages to learn if you did want to start from scratch."

I'd take a look at learning the basics of NPM (node package manager, which you may already be using) along with Express, a framework that makes API development very simple imo."

My goal is to be a decent full stack to be able to touch every kind of projects in HubSpot."

    "text": "Another option you may want to consider is Ruby on Rails. It's a framework where the front-end and back-end are connected in one codebase by default, and it will also force you to learn more about actual database structure, whereas because I'm more familiar with node and express I'm more apt to work with APIs and JSON. These aren't exclusive cases, you can use APIs and databases with anything, it's just about workflow and what comes with what by default.  I'm currently learning more RoR myself and for building something fairly robust for production, it's a great system"
