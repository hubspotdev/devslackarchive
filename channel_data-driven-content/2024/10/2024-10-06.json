    "text": "Hi Team\nI am encountering an issue when trying to add a GraphQL file to a module. I have created multiple files in our portal, but only four files are showing in the dropdown menu. When I attempt to create a new file, the previously created file is removed from all modules, and the newly created file is added to all modules. Additionally, if I change a file within the same theme but in a different module, the file in the previous module also changes. For example, I have created two modules: \"Course Search\" and \"Course Details.\" When I change a file within the \"Course Details\" module, the file in the \"Course Search\" module also changes. Furthermore, previous files are not showing in the dropdown. Is there a limit to the number of files that can be created?, I want to use 2 different files in different module",
