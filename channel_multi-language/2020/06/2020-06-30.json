    "text": "Hey <@UUX58C0S3>, right now there are some limitations on blog listing pages in regards to checking for the content.language.languageTag variable. For example, if you added `{{content.language.languageTag|pprint}}` to that page, it would return a null value.\n\nWhat you can do in these cases, however, is do a string check against the group URL. Doing something like the following would work:\n```{% if group.slug is string_startingwith \"es-co/\" %}\n{% global_partial path=\"../partials/partials co/header co.html\" %}\n{% else %}\n[...]```\nAs a heads up, someone from your team looks to have already contacted our Support team about this issue recently, so I've reviewed this use case with the Support Rep and walked through the above implementation for your listing page with them."
