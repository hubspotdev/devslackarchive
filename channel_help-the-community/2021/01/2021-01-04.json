    "text": "I'm troubleshooting a HubDB issue on a client's website that resulted from a HS migration and would appreciate any help. The client's portfolio page is built out using HubDB. Every time a new portfolio item is added, the correlating page/URL is generating correctly but multiple other pages with incorrect page paths are getting created as well. For example, this <https://www.bellweatherdesignbuild.com/portfolio/sun-room-addition-eat-in-kitchen|portfolio item> has 6 additional pages with incorrect page paths."
