I am trying to clone pages in content staging and switch over the templates that way, but I am noticing that none of the theme templates are showing up when I try to do so.\n\nNote that the templates are showing up as an option to select when I create a new, blank staged page. Is this expected behavior? Can we not swap templates from a legacy drag and drop template to a theme template? Do we need to make a blank page starting with the theme template and then copy/paste content into it?",
