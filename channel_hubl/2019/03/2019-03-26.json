I believe related_blog_posts is new, I'm pretty sure up until last month there was a workaround on this link, so that's cool :slightly_smiling_face: Anyway, I wanted to ask if anyone knows of a quick way of checking if there are no related posts, like {% if !related_blog_posts %} {% if related_blog_posts.count == 0 %}. Thanks! <https://designers.HubSpot.com/tutorials/creating-a-related-post-listing>"
