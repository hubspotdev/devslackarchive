    "text": "yeah, but serverless_fn_1 would need to validate authentication with 'something' (credentials, token, key, whatever) or else anyone can hit and get the token. <@UDU6KEBFB> in our case we're not using an external service for user authentication, we're using hs in the front end(private pages). The serverless function should use that auth token to re-validate auth, but there doesnt seem to be a way of validating  the __hsmem cookie (the session auth token given to authed users) through the API. So maybe we look into using an external service for auth that both front end and 'backend'(here, serverless func) can authentify to. This is were that path as taken me."
