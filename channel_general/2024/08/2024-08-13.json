Not sure is it a right address to ask a question on HS form submission outside the HS pages.\nI have non-HS landing page which has HS form.\nThe goal is to put sumission into active lists which will be imported to marketing event.\nIt wouldn't be the problem to solve only one event. Bu I have it 60. So, I'm looking for solution. Whatever I get on idea, I can't reach website URL property, so I can put it as a criteria for the list.\n\nDid anybody have this kind of challenge?",

    "text": "Hey <@U05UV02FUP7>, if you're reffering to the enterprise \"Sandbox\" function - from my experience - it's not really ment for CMS work. For CMS sandboxing I'd use content staging and a seperate/standalone CMS sandbox.\nIf you're using <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/website-pages/redesign-and-relaunch-your-site-with-content-staging|content staging> - everything is in your live portal and won't interfere with the live pages unless you push them from staging to live. Then the pages from staging will be replacing the live ones.\nWith a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/get-started|CMS sandbox>* it's a bit different. Those sandboxes are great for theme module development, especially if you're using <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/cms/quickstart|local development>. If you should build pages in the sandbox you could move them via the pages API - but - I recommend to use content staging. Saves you a lot of time and potential headaches :slightly_smiling_face: Another possible solution might be to create a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/cms/setup/github-integration#use-the-HubSpot-cms-deploy-github-action-(recommended)|GitHub action>. So you're pushing changes from local to a git repo, this repo pushes it to your dev account and your live account.\n\nIn terms of showing the navigation on an external service - you will most likely run into CORS issues displaying something on a different domain so my recommendation would be to recreate the navigation from HubSpot in your external eCom platform.\n\n\n*the CMS Developer Sandbox accounts might be limited. I'm recommending to create an App Developer account on the page, which let's you create up to 10 \"almost\" Enterprise level portals(there are a few limitiations for good reason but not in terms of most common functionalities)"
