    "text": "We have a quite complex HubDB structure that generates pages 3 levels deep. The problem is that the site search api delivers outdated results, almost 2 months old. The domain and url still contains sandbox url’s, and also the titles contain information that is not in HubDB anymore. We already moved the site to production, so the actual url should show, as well as the updated data from HubDB.\n\nThe url format we use to get the search dropdown information is: <https://api.hubapi.com/contentsearch/v2/search?portalId=***********&limit=100&offset=0&term=********&type=SITE_PAGE&autocomplete=true> also with autocomplete=false the results are outdated. An example of the cachekey is:\n`cacheKey\": \"******::SITE_PAGE:100::/nl/beesd:1:horren:1:LONG:0:1.0:5.0:0::::0:0:/**.***.***.***:[]::1:UNKNOWN::::0:0:0:0\",`\nMaybe this could help identify the problem?\n\nI’ve tried different times with support, but they keep telling it should be re-indexed while apparently it’s not the case. Anyone knows what to do here?"
