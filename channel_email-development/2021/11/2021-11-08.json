    "text": "Hi all - I'm experiencing what appears to be a bug in the HubSpot email editor. I have a shell MJML template I use over and over, but I edit the body / main content of my email campaigns in Litmus Builder, and then copy + paste them into the email by selecting `Advanced` &gt; `Source Code`. It's worked fine every time until now. When I paste in my code and hit `Save changes`, it just won't update - anyone experience anything similar before?",
