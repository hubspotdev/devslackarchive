    "text": "Hi everyone. We’re getting started with HubSpot and have a data wh (sql) where all of our contact, company, deal info lives. We’re using hightouch to map the wh to HS but are having issues because the company email doesn't always map to the contact. It seems like we may need to use the associations API? Looking for a freelancer to help figure this out for us. Thanks! US based but you don't have to be. "
