    "text": "Hi folks,\n\nHaving a question around *meeting api.*\n\nI’d like to get all occurence of meetings. From what I understand from the UI interface and the api doc, there are 2 sorts of HubSpot Meeting :\n• 1) the meetings you can associate with a contact *from within the contact page* (where you can also assign other activities such as email, call etc) \n• 2) the meetings *within the Sales section* where you can create “calendly like” meetings which are also referred as scheduling pages  \nI can get the 1) meetings from the api through `<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/meetings>` endpoint, *but I would like to get also results/bookings from 2) meetings*\n\nAny idea / suggestions on how to achieve that ?\n\nThanks in advance !",

    "text": "The documentation for the v4 batch association endpoints is incorrectly listed under the \"association schema endpoint tab\" instead of the \"association endpoint\" tab. Also, the \"association endpoint\" tab batch section has batch object endpoints listed instead of the batch association endpoints.\nThis cost me the better part of a week, because when I didn't see batch association support in v4 (and the official libraries don't support v4 associations) I developed my code using the v3 endpoints through the official Ruby library. The v3 create batch association endpoint works for v4 created association labels BUT only for custom objects. It silently ignores trying to associate companies and contacts !\nI really hope there's ongoing work to move to release a unified version of the API with full support in the official libraries. The current state of HubSpot APIs and libraries is disappointing, to say the least.",

How do yo query them ? \n2. When are they recorded ? each time a user selects a “calendly like” slot or when the sales “associates” it ? \nThanks for being so helpful to the community :slightly_smiling_face:"
