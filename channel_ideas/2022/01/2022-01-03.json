    "text": "I feel like the UI for switches in fields is off. Typically, switches are lined up with each other, preferably on the right, but rarely on the left as well; I think checkboxes on the left, and switches on the right is the way to go. It looks a little chaotic and haphazard when they're not lined up, especially if you have much more varied label lengths. <https://cdn.vizality.com/u/cbOZjJrLdm.png> <https://cdn.vizality.com/u/oYXUF7LJOT.png> <https://cdn.vizality.com/u/ov2K3Y2NxD.png>",

It would be nice to have properties of `default_lines: 3`  `max_lines`, `min_lines` or something to that effect, and or add a `textarea`  field type with properties such as these.",
