    "text": "Hi, we have a custom code block in our workflow to execute a weighted round robin. The issue is often times, one of the reps leaves on vacation, and we ned to alter the round robin, and remember to add them back in. So, instead, I was going to do a if then, IF today is between these dates, then do this weighted round robin (with out the rep that is on vacation), BUT if not in those dates, then run the regular weighted round robin.\n\nIssue is, my python code needs to import modules (date and time), but doesnt look like custom code allows importing. Do you guys know of any work arounds? It works perfect in VS Code!\nThe error I get\n```[ERROR] Runtime.ImportModuleError: Unable to import module 'HubSpotHandler': No module named 'datetimerange'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nMemory: 38/128 MB\nRuntime: 1.23 ms```\nHere is my date code:\n```from datetime import datetime, date\nfrom datetimerange import DateTimeRange\n\n\ntodayTime = datetime.today()\n\n\nleaveDate = datetime(1995, 3, 20)\nreturnDate = datetime(2025, 1, 1)\n\noutCome = todayTime &gt;= leaveDate and todayTime &lt;= returnDate\nprint(todayTime &gt;= leaveDate and todayTime &lt;= returnDate)```",
