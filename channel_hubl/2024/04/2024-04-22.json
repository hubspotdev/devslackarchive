    "text": "Hello everyone I found an issue in our production website this morning and having a hard time figuring out why HubDB foreign columns are not working as expected  as of 12 noon central. More details below.\n\nRendering out the dynamic variable  {{dynamic_page_hubdb_row}} will show the result:\n```{id=67618770856, createdAt=1646323896809, updatedAt=1646323942763, path='memorial', name='a name', 1='{type=string, value=Memorial}', 2='{type=string, value=location-600}', 3='{type=list, value=[{id=66546137478, name='location-600'}]}'}```\nattempting to render out the following:\n{{dynamic_page_hubdb_row[1]}}\n{{dynamic_page_hubdb_row[2]}}\n{{dynamic_page_hubdb_row[3]}}\nwill display:\nMemorial\nlocation-600\n[]\n\nFor context column 3 is of type “Foreign ID”. As of yesterday i was able to retrieve information by using the column name “foreign_id_locations_table_join” and it was pulling in data from that record successfully, now there’s an empty array\n\n{{dynamic_page_hubdb_row.foreign_id_locations_table_join}} renders an empty array.
