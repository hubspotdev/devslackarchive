    "text": "Hi! I'm not sure if this is the right channel. I already tried the support but unfortunately it was a peculiar case.\n\nI am managing a client's account for wordpress to HubSpot hosted website. All is good with the development of the website and we wanted to test it on the live domain so we changed the DNS record to match the HubSpot values. The HubSpot webpages are displaying with no problem and we are quite satisfied with it but we need to go back to the old wordpress site while working on somethings.\n\nThe problem now is when we removed all the HubSpot values from the DNS records and used the old values from the previous wordpress site, we are still being served the HubSpot webpages we made in HubSpot. We already checked the DNS records and it already propagated but it is still serving the HubSpot webpages. If anyone have any idea what's happening please kindly explain.",
