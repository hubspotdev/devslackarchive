    "text": "Hi! I am trying to increase and decrease a value number on button click with hubl. Is it possible to trigger a macro function onclick? My code below is not working, but it would be ideal to solve it that way. The reason why I want to do the increase/decrease with hubl and not javascript, is because I want to use the same variable to multiply to a list of numbers in a repeatable group (that part of the code is working great).  Any ideas how to solve this?\n```{% set my_num = 4 %}\n\n{% macro add_number() %}\n  {{ my_num|add(1) }}\n{% endmacro %}\n\n{% macro subtract_number() %}\n  {{ my_num|add(-1) }}\n{% endmacro %}\n\n&lt;button onclick=\"{{ subtract_number() }}\"&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"text\" value=\"{{my_num}}\"&gt;\n&lt;button onclick=\"{{ add_number() }}\"&gt;\n\n{% for item in module.ingredient_list %}\n   &lt;p class=\"recipe_ingredient_number\"&gt;{{ my_num|multiply(item.ingredient_number) }}&lt;/p&gt;\n{% endfor %}```",
