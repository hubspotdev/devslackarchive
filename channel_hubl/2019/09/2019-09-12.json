    "text": "Great <@U7V9DQ31P>, it works. All `macros`, `if`, `elif`, and `for` instructions written like this `{%- if stuff -%}`, `{%- endif -%}` delete all blank rows and spaces. I just had to put the last statement (`{{my_variable}}`) on the same line of the last instruction (`{% set my_variable = stuff %}`) to prevent line break in the returned value. The last line is so: `{% set my_variable = stuff %}{{my_variable}}`. Thank you Stefen. It does the job. <@UHGJ1MN14> you can use it if you want, it works like a charm."

By the way, it's just not proportionate to create an integration (server/oauth/webhooks/etc.) to solve an easy problem like this one.\nProbably we will create a lambda function to address this particular issue, but we can't do it this way everytime, because of the unjustified growth of \"useless\" properties in CRM"

I can hardcode the staged homepage url instead but it’s one more thing to update at site launch, or consider when using content staging for further changes.\n```\n&lt;a href=\"{{ company_domain if group else '/' }}\"&gt;\n  &lt;img&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n```"
