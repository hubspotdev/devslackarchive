    "text": "<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/creating-an-efficient-development-workflow|https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/creating-an-efficient-development-workflow>\n\nWe suggest in our docs having each dev use a sandbox portal if they need to dev at the same time. You can use github actions to auto deploy branches like main or a develop branch to your production portal or to a shared test portal.\n\nEach team or individual will have different preferences on how they want to set that up. For example if you only have 1 developer they may only care to have the production and testing/develop portal. \n\nYou can adjust the workflow to fit your team and your teams needs."
