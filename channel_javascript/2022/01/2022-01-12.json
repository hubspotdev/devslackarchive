    "text": "In this case, you don't need to search all contacts in the entire database, you should just get the contacts that are associated to the deal, and then filter them until you find the right one.\n\nThat's possible using the associations API. There are a few examples in the Use Case Library that show similar patterns, but you'd have to customize for your specific use case.\n\nTwo samples that come to mind (actually both written by me! :smile: )\n• <https://www.HubSpot.com/programmable-automation-use-cases?offer=associate-contact-deal-to-company|Use case> - from contact workflow, get all associated deals, then associate to the contacts company| Code: <https://github.com/HubSpot/sample-workflow-custom-code/blob/main/samples/associate_contact_deals_to_company.js>\n•  <https://www.HubSpot.com/programmable-automation-use-cases?offer=high-value-line-items-deal|Use case> - from a deal workflow, get associated line items, get details about those line items, filter the line items where amount &gt; 1000, update deal | Code: <https://gist.github.com/robertainslie/12314f50a8d2073f64a6ebef65953447>\nThe second example is actually pretty close to what you're trying to do, except it's getting associated Line Items and filtering to only the line items with an amount &gt; 1000. You would likely want to customize to get associated contacts, and then filter to just the one/ones with the property value you want"
