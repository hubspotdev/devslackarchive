    "text": "Hi Everyone! I have two questions that I could use some guidance on.\n1. Using HubSpot ctas on a theme site, and there is a small period of time where the ctas do not render, and then they ‘pop in’. Is there anyway to reduce that time to make it faster or anything I can do to make it less noticeable?\n2. I have a client that has a separate application with a sign up form. They are wanting to track conversions on that form of where a contact came from. Is the best approach to pass the referrer information into a hidden field on that form to send over via HubSpot’s forms API or is there a better way?",
