    "text": "Thanks for the feedback.\n\nYou're right:\n• today Standard Sandboxes can be created either through the UI or using the CLI\n    ◦ Dev sandboxes can only be created using the CLI. \nThe creation logic for dev sandboxes is to ensure that technical users are able to have their own isolated sandbox for when the job to be done requires them to have an isolated replica of the production account and when they want to do testing that could impact other testers active in a standard sandbox.\n\nSome other noteworthy differences are:\n• Today *`standard sandboxes`* are available to all customers who have at least one Enterprise level hub (CMS, Marketing, Sales, Service, Ops)\n    ◦ *`Dev Sandboxes`* are part of the CRM Development Tools beta which is currently only available to Sales and/or Service Hub Enterprise customers. \n• *`Standard Sandboxes`* support syncing of the the same production account's features and functionalities, crm object definitions + custom objects, and all assets appearing in the screenshot.  \n    ◦ *`Dev Sandboxes`* are bare-bones, only syncing production account's features and functionalities + production account's crm object definitions + custom objects. \n&gt; As long as the standard sandbox can support serverless functions and I can access it with the CLI, I think I will have what I need to setup our staging environment.\nYes, you should be able to.\n\nHope this helps clarify some of the nuances, but let me know if you have any other questions, or feedback!!",
