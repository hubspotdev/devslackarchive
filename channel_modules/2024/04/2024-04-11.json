In design manager, I cloned an existing quote template that we use and added new line items. The problem is, these choices still dont show up in the actual quotes.. What am I missing?\n\nI can see the options in the preview and when I'm doing the quotes, but if I click on next, it only pulls in the description of the product and not the values that I entered for the line item column properties. The third photo is the actual quote",
