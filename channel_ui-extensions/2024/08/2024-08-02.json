Historically as well search API but in many cases this was replaced by GQL which helps us to not get into the narrow API limit for search API.\n2: It is something like all deals attached to a ticket and the line_items of the deals. When we do a CPQ solution it is searching the products as well which is not possible at scale so we use external cache / database instead.\n3.: a.) Product searches with logic like a pattern in a certain product category b.) a good error handling when GQL complexity points reduce the size of the returned message"
