They need to make some changes to the code on that template (actually to a global module used by that template). Since it's a marketplace theme, HubSpot won't let me edit the module itself and recommends creating a child theme. Is there any way to do this where we don't have to open every single landing page and manually change their template to one from the child theme?",
