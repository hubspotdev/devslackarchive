I'm not sure if I'm using this correctly but I created another Figma file and started copying components from the HubSpot Figma file, then it took some learning to work with the bigger components but I ended up with a good mockup, better than the ones I built with lucid before (much better) so I think im good now."

What are the most common HubSpot APIs have you been using. What are some common operations?\n2. Any example of some complex operations with data fetched from API calls, or stacking API calls one after another?\n3. What has been the most challenging aspect of HubSpot data fetch operations through serverless functions?\n4. Do you prefer to use REST or GQL when you deal with HubSpot data?",
