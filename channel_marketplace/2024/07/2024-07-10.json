    "text": "Hello HubSpotters :wave::skin-tone-2: !\n\n:awesome: Great news in the world of themes today. The restriction on membership templates has been removed for themes. So, if you have been thinking of building membership themes or just wanted to add membership templates to your existing theme, there are no restrictions on doing so. The current theme requirements can be found <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/marketplace-guidelines/theme-requirements|here>.\n\nPlease note, the use of membership templates is only possible with Content Hub Professional and above. If you are looking to build a membership theme where it would be absolutely necessary to use the membership templates, you would need to mention that in your theme’s overview on your listing page. For example: “_This theme requires the use of membership templates that are only available in Content Hub Professional and above”._",
