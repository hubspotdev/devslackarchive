    "text": "<@UBT0AHWLD> <@U2H3TT8F2> Currently, I'm using *macros for the markup* and the *module for the fields* values, to do that. Below is just a simple example. I'm  also using it in different advanced ways to share markup between global and local modules, as well as dynamic pages.\n\nmodule has on field to select a page:\n```  {% from '../../templates/macros/item-macro.html' import item %}\n  {{ item( content_by_id(module.page) ) }}```\nand _item-macro.html_ has the markup:\n```  {% macro item( content ) %}\n    &lt;a href=\"{{ content.absolute_url }}\"&gt;{{ content.name }}&lt;/a&gt;\n  {% endmacro %}```\nIn the case of a submodule it would extend the existing fields of a module with the submodule fields. But I'm not sure if I like this, macros seems to me the better way, even if you have to create the module-fields you need to reuse a markup-macro."
