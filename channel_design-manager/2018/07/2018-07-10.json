    "text": "This week we’re learning that page modules using {{ var.flex(“”) }} are now broken. This affects almost all of the websites we’ve built in the last year, in particular for resource pages, portfolio pages, team member listings, things we built (hacked?) so they would filter nicely in HubSpot.\n\nThis is of course a bit of a challenge b/c now we’re thinking we’re going to need to re-build a lot of things, urgent work for which there is not budget.  \n\nSpecifically, the problem is for modules that are used on multiple pages. Their flex columns have different ID, which means we have to create a separate locked custom module for each page.\n\nI’m not a dev, but sharing this costly challenge we just ran into. I realize this use is not expressly supported, just alerting in case others did similar things.",
