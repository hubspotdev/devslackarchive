    "text": "Hello,\n\nCurrently i have quotes up and running, and each quote is fetching the custom objects associated to the deal generated from using the below line of code:\n```{% set customobject = template_data.quote.associated_objects.deal.associated_objects.custom_objects.ObjectID %}```\nThis is returning all the custom objects associated to the deal.\n\nHow can i add to this line of code the association type ID. I already have the association type ID(297), just don't know how to add it to the existing scenario.\nThis way, i want to fetch only the custom objects associated to the deal and that have a certain association label.\n\nThanks!"
