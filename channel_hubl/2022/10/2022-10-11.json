    "text": "Hey everyone!\nI have a custom module that references a HubDB table of ~75 items that I'd like to display in batches. I currently have the table items pulled in by batches of 7. I'd like for the 8th card to be a recent blog post, and have a different recent blog post shown for each of the batches.\n```{% set table = hubdb_table_rows(TABLE_ID) %}\n{% for row in table|batch(7) %}\n                \n{% for cell in row %}\n&lt;div class=\"card-item\"&gt;\nCARD CONTENT\n&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n\n{% set posts = blog_recent_posts(\"default\", 1) %}\n{% for post in posts %}\n&lt;div class=\"card-item blog-card\"&gt;\nBLOG CARD CONTENT\n&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n\n{% endfor %}```\nThe code above is only displaying the same recent blog post in each batch of table items.\nIs this sort of functionality possible with this method? Is there a better method I could be using?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "text": "I think the issue is that each loop the posts will be set to the first recent posts since you’re going to call blog_recent_posts each loo, so it’ll always be that first most recent posts. Maybe initialize it outside of the loop and use the loop.index0. Would something like\n```{% set posts = blog_recent_posts(\"default\", 12) %}\n{% set table = hubdb_table_rows(TABLE_ID) %}\n{% for row in table|batch(7) %}\n                \n{% for cell in row %}\n&lt;div class=\"card-item\"&gt;\nCARD CONTENT\n&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n\n\n&lt;div class=\"card-item blog-card\"&gt;\n//use posts[loop.index0] to get content here?\n&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n\n{% endfor %}```\nWork for you?"
