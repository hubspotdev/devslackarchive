Basically the auto-blocking scripts caused either delay or acceleration of the DomContentLoaded state which in turn affected our init function, so we rewrote it to the following which works:\n\n`if (document.readyState !== 'loading') {`\n    `initCode();`\n`} else {`\n    `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {`\n        `initCode();`\n    `});`\n`}`"
