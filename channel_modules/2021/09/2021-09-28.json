Would it be better to create separate CSS files and call for those in the main CSS file? Would that reduce requests, or would be the same thing? Thanks in advance!",

    "text": "Hi Antonio what do you mean by a lot of requests? I'm currently building themes and  using custom modules then I inject CSS and JS in each module. This has greatly reduced the weight of the pages and JS blocking issues. I can't be for certain but I would think one of the reason HubSpot is moving to this model is it reduces the overhead of irrelevant CSS and JS that effects page loading. I don't work for HubSpot so I'm just making some big assumptions."
