The images were displaying very well and from one day to the next they are no longer displayed.\n\nYou can see the problem on this page: <https://www.asys.fr/gestion-temps-activites/logiciel-gestion-temps-de-travail> In the section: “Découvrez nos solutions complémentaires à la gestion des temps de travail”.\n\nHas anyone had this problem before?",
