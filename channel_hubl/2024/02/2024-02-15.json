Ideally you would be able to choose this color somewhere the page settings, but not sure if this is possible to achieve. Basically somehow the global menu module need to access a variable that is set in HubSpot and tells the module what background it should render for the current page.. Any suggestions on how to solve this?",

This function doesn’t seem to be documented anywhere, and I don’t seem to be having any luck trying to switch out the default selection of fonts for my preferred ones.\n\nDoes anyone have more info on `load_fonts` or know where I could find documentation for it?
