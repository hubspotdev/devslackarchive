    "text": "The HubL VSCode extension needs a lot of improvement, some things like: autocomplete (if I start typing in `get_asset` in a HubL file I would expect an autocomplete for \"get_asset_url()\"), and hover information for variables, functions, and filters. It would also be nice to have syntax validation when using default modules (e.g. if I use `@HubSpot/linked_image` it would let me know that `img` arg needs to be an object and that it's required)."
