    "text": "Hello,\n\nI am working with a client that has a specific module on a Landing Page. She couldn't add this module to a \"regular\" page, and at first we thought the module was LP only.\nHowever, I cannot find this module anywhere in the Design Tools. I have checked the Landing Page's template to check if maybe the \"name\" was different in the page editor only, but couldn't find it there.\nI realized I can't even add this module in the very Landing Page it's currently on. It's a \"Recent Blog Posts\" module and I wonder if this might be some old module that no longer exists?\n\nIt made me wonder, is it possible that a module no longer exists in the Design Tools, but is still working on the site?",
