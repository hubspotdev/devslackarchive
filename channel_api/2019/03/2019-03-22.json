The third party service needs some required schema, and i dont know how can I do this with Webhook. Is it possible or I will need middleware for this?",

Does anyone know the correct data format to send the value in?\n\nI have tried sending as an array which although the API doesn’t error, the value on the contact in HubSpot becomes blank. If I try sending it as a comma separated string, it is rejected because it doesn’t match one of the allowed values. I am not sure what else to try.\n\nThanks!!",
