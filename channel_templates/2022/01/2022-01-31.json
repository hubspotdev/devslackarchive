The module is created and working fine, but the problem is the HTML coded section renders as if it is not within the same template. (When i test the email, this section appears out of the email template dimensions, as if it is not inside the email frame)\nI am used to code emails using tables approach. Is there a specific way to code this for it to be treated as an embedded section in my email body ? It is a multiple column html section."
