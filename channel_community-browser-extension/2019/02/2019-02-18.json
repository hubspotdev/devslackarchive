    "text": "minor update coming to beta users likely this week. If you have UI tweaks enabled. the back to module link when in the page editor is going to be moved to the bottom of the pane. Before this feature goes live though I want to evaluate better ways of toggling this feature on/off as I donâ€™t feel like lumping it under the UI Tweaks is a great solution, we have a lot of UI tweaks now that the extension makes.\n\nIf you run into any issues with the new feature let me know."
