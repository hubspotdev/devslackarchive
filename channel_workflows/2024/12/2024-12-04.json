    "text": "Howdy Folks!\nI recently added the SMS addon to our HubSpot, and I'm trying to trigger SMS messages via the API - is this possible?\n\nI have a livestreaming website, and users want to subscribe to SMS alerts when a show starts. I have a serverless function that triggers whenever a show starts, but I'm trying to learn how to trigger the SMS when that function fire.\nI tried using the webhook-driven workflow, but when I send a `fetch` to the address I was given I get a 415 unspported media type error.\n\nHas anyone done something like this? TIA!"
