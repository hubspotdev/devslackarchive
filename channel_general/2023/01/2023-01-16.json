    "text": ":wave: Hello all!\n\nI am looking to add Telegram support to HubSpot.\n\nIt seems like the most ideal way would be if the `Crm.Engagements.Communications` <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/communications|API> supported a `TELEGRAM` type natively, but I see that isn’t possible (as HubSpot would have to add it as a feature).\n\nNext best thing would be if we were able to create a custom engagement type (or a custom communications type) — is that possible?\n\nTo get something up and running quickly, I was thinking of creating a custom <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/timeline|Timeline Event> <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/timeline|Template>, and batch telegram messages into the same event.\n\nIdeally, it would look very similar to the native `Email` timeline event — Emails are threaded, and you can respond to the thread directly from the Timeline. Do we know if I can create an input box on my custom timeline event, letting the user type in a message and click a “send” button (which would make an API call through my app)",
