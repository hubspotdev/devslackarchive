    "text": "Hi all - I'm Phil, co-founder of Blend, a HubSpot diamond partner based Reading, near London, in the UK. While I'm technically minded, I'm not a developer - I have a great team of them here thankfully (<@U7VHQMEV7><@UGML1K20G><@UGASRPTU5><@UHNBCT0Q1>). However, from time to time I could really use the help of the developer community to help me solve issues relating to complex customer requirements, integrations and the like - so I would like to thank you all in advance for your support. I will try to return the favour when I can - though it may not be that often given the subject :grinning: - I am, however, doing my bit over on <http://community.HubSpot.com|community.HubSpot.com> - Great to meet you all!"
