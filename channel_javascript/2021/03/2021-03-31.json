When i click on the element i get the error:\n\n&gt; â€œUncaught ReferenceError: filterSelection is not defined\nThe element is inside the HTML &amp; HubL Block of a module. The JS-function is inside the module.js of the same module. When i put the JavaScript Code into an external file and link it with the module then the function is working. Does anyone know what the problem is with this solution? The script of the module.js and the external JavaScript are loaded at the same place (below the HTML-Code).\n\n```&lt;li class=\"btn active\" onclick=\"filterSelection('all')\"&gt; All&lt;/li&gt;```",
