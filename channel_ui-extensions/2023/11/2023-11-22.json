    "text": "Hello everyone:wave-yeti::stable_parrot:We saw that a lot of you had questions about Layout Management, specifically `&lt;Flex&gt;` and `&lt;Box&gt;`. To help you in this process, we’ve released a new sample project called “<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/sample-projects#managing-layouts-flex-and-box|Managing Layouts: Flex and Box>”. This sample has two cards (see GIFs below) that show you how to :\n• Use many components together in a Tile format\n• Play around with the properties of `&lt;Flex&gt;`\n• Implement good UX Practices with spacing\n• Create two cards in one project\nWe hope this makes your custom card building experience even better and smoother! If you have any feedback we'd LOVE to hear it. Feel free to reply to this thread or we can set up a quick call:sprocket-dance:",
