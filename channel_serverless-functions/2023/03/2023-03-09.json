As a result, CORS is occurring.\n\nFor example, the domain I use is: <https://xxxx.com>...\nThe blog post creation page domain is: <https://app.HubSpot.com/>\n\nI know it's a simple problem to solve if you have a server outside.\nBut honestly, I have serverless functions and I don't want to have an external server, and I want to know if I can solve this problem.\n\nIf you have friends who know the solution, please let me know.",
