    "text": "SMART RULE AND CLONING ISSUE\nHS support is looking at this but wanted to cast a wider net. I've created a web page utilizing referrer type smart rules. That is working as expected. However, when that page is cloned the clone looses the rule variation content and seemingly the rule itself. Yet, when I click to try to add (re create) the rule the cloned rule is listed but not its content. The behavior is happening across all Windows browsers. HS is able to reproduce the issue within our account but not within their test account. Anyone else experience this? Might it be template related? We are using Neambo's ACT 2.1."
