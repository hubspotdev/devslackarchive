That appears to be related to something that happens upon sending the email (does not happen in the preview or preview page.) I've also tested the email in a third party email tester both sending through HubSpot and by directly uploading the code.\n\nWhen the email is sent through HubSpot a table appears to get closed early, breaking the layouts. and I can confirm the code is different when inspected in gmail after being sent through HubSpot.\n\nHere is the email preview page\n<http://www.bbdcpa.com/-temporary-slug-91c804c7-dfb9-432f-b5dc-3d3b0b8e044e?hs_preview=GziSqauZ-5462488615>\n\nHere is a screenshot from outlook\n<https://ol2010.capture.litmuscdn.com/ec924db1-d2a8-4784-b5d6-b59a2ef54c14/results/ol2010-vertical-allowed-1366.png>\n\nAs you can see once you hit the text that says beginning of image and text modules - it breaks. \nThis issue is not specific to outlook it happens across the board. One would assume I've got something going on with my code but it appears it's something that only happens when sending from HubSpot. Will test with Mailchimp  shortly."
