When documentation articles were a sort of dive in into detail on more specific level.\n\nSo my recommendation would be academy course first &gt; documentation then.\n\nI’m also practicing code rewriting technic. Manually writing code line by line from HS boilerplate or their default theme helps me understand and remember the structure and how things work inside."
