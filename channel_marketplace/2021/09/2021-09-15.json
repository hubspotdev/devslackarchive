    "text": "Hey <@U0276HSQAE8>,\n\nThere could be several things based on your solution but, here are a few general points:\n\n1. The installation may differ based on the solution you plan to publish in the App marketplace like App or Theme.\n2. Please check for the minimum requirement of Installation before submitting an App to get approval from HubSpot...probably the installation should be &gt; 3\n3. If you are building an app that requires HubSpot scopes, take care that only necessary scopes should be used during OAuth call.\n4. The most of themes get installed directly from HubSpot App Marketplace.\n5. You can utilise the direct HubSpot link at your side as well, and users can access it.\n6. Keep checking for the users' feedback once your App/ theme gets live.\n7. If you need feedback for your newly launched Theme or App, you can post the requirements here:\n      <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Share-Your-Work/bd-p/designers_bestpractice|https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Share-Your-Work/bd-p/designers_bestpractice>"
