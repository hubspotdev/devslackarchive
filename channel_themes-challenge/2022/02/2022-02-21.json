    "text": "Hi <@U2H3TT8F2>! Thanks for posting the update. I'm still a little bit confused though, and I'd highly appreciate it if you could shed some light on the review process.\nWe were one of the first who submitted their work (back in December), it took a while to get the first feedback from your review team. We implemented changes instantly within just 2-3 days and re-submitted the themes (please see the screenshot attached).\nI've just checked the queue and there're 70 items in the queue and it's February 22. You've mentioned that semi-finalist will be announced on February 28 (in just 6 days!).\nDoes this mean that we aren't eligible for the contest?",
