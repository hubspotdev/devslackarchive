    "text": "Welcome to developers Kavitha! Basically there are two main methods to integrate apps to HubSpot:\n1. Direct connection between HubSpot and other app with API key or OAuth. More <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/overview|here> and in <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/overview|legacy docs>. This might need a middleware if the other app canâ€™t make request to HubSpot API directly.\n2. The easier way is to use <http://zapier.com|Zapier> or  <http://piesync.com|Piesync> if both apps are listed there. \n\nIf you want :rocket: start to building own app, you could use this Github repo as a base of your own project: <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs|https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs>"
