    "text": "Yeah, as obnoxious as the bloated dnd HTML is (and boy, is it BLOATED), it’s the exact kind of stuff that gzip or brotli can take down to nearly nothing. Looking at my network tab, the compressed HTML is only a 13.6kb download.\n\nI’d second Byron’s comments, that `1. Dashboard(1).png`,  `2. Risks.png`, `3. Assets.png`, `4. Technologies.png` and especially `5. Graph.png` account for the majority of the page’s load time.\n\nSince it seems like these images are pretty important, I’d suggest taking some time to manually optimize them using something like <https://squoosh.app|Squoosh>. For example, I was able to get `5. Graph.png` down from ~520kb to ~80kb by pre-scaling it to 1750x1244 and saving it at 50% quality with MozJPEG. I’m sure you could get even better results with a little bit of tuning."
