    "text": "I guess i wanted to bypass the process of having to save the menu items in a hubdb table dinamically and then fetching them from somewhere else (like a completely different app), because my project is composed of two parts:\n1. static content witch is served by HubSpot and is hosted on HubSpot\n2. dinamic content witch is created in nextjs because of great pre-rendering and performance capabilities and is masked under HubSpot with a reverse proxy.\nSo that is why i need the navigation to be identical on both. User must not see the transition between basically completely different apps.\nMy idea was to find out if there is an api endpoint that can get me the whole menu object since the menus are set up in the navigation page in the HubSpot settings.\nBut nevermind that because i will end up using the hubdb as you mentioned.\nThank you :smile:"
