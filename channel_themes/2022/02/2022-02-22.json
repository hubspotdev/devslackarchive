    "text": "HubSpot no longer adds the height attribute to images in Rich text, which is bad practice, because it causes layout shift if the images are lazy-loaded: <https://web.dev/optimize-cls/#images-without-dimensions>. This is especially bad if the user wants to link to an anchor on another page. It won't correctly scroll to that anchor if there are lazy-loaded images without the height attribute defined before the anchor, because the browser doesn't know the aspect ratio of the images (the height is missing) and cannot correctly calculate the top of the anchor. This is also true if you want to build something fancy with JS where page scrolling and position of elements are involved. Could you please look into this and add the *height* attribute back to images in Rich text? For example:\n\n```&lt;img src=\"<https://f.HubSpotusercontent>.../test.jpg?width=1200&amp;name=test.jpg\" alt=\"test\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 1200px;\"&gt;```",
