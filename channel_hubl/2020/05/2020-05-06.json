I want to create the theme, that when i switch the domain to HubSpot i dont need to change all the absolute links or images. So i need to have two variables:\n1. Link-URL of Homepage (just the basic url of the page)\n2. URL to Media-Folder - The URL of the media folder so that i can use the images of the folder inside a hubl-theme\nThank you so much!",
