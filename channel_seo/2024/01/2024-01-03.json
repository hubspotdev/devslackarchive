Is there anything that might bias changes in reporting from that client’s audience? Is traffic dropping or remaining constant in other audiences?\n\nIf the traffic is almost _exactly_ double and the other traffic is staying steady, I’d guess that you’ve got some sort of double-counting issue from a duplicate pixel or page view trigger."

    "text": "Normally I’d say that I’m 90% confident that this is an issue of double-dipping on page views, but the numbers are just ever-so-slightly off. It’s looking like direct is closer to ~2.5–3x, whereas a double-dip would usually hover between ~1.8–2.1x.\n\nI’d still check for double-dipping, since the discrepancy could be explained by a real spike in direct that just happened to be amplified by an implementation issue. Maybe someone slipped a duplicate tracking code snippet or an `_hsq.push(['trackPageView']);` into Google Tag Manager and forgot to prevent the trigger from firing on the main site, or added something to the page head via the settings panel.\n\nMy next suspicion would be bots or other automated traffic. Most professionally-configured GA instances will use a filtered view as their default — it’s possible you wouldn’t see a spike in bad traffic because it’s being excluded from the dataset you’re looking at. If there’s an Unfiltered/All Data view, I’d check if the spike appears there.\n\nIf your client has a Facebook pixel installed, you can also check traffic numbers against what you see in Facebook Analytics to determine whether HubSpot or GA is the outlier."

    "text": "Something of a side note: that disproportionate climb in direct post-August is also a somewhat suspicious. It’s very unusual to see direct grow significantly while other channels are stagnant or shrinking — that behavior is _usually_ a sign that direct is erroneously getting credit for other channels’ traffic."
