    "text": "Hi there! I have an old, existing project which I need to work on locally. I have node 12.18.0 and CLI v 1.1.7. I can run `hs init` , can get and paste in my key and give it a name. I then get the message `[SUCCESS] HubSpot.config.yml created with Personal Access Key.` BUT - no HubSpot.config.yml file has been created. I have searched everywhere but it does not exist so when I try `hs fetch [NAME]` I get the error: `[ERROR] The request failed because \"mastered\" was not found in portal XXXXXXX. resource not found`  I ahve also tried manually creating the file and also using `hs auth` but with the same result.\nAnyone any ideas?",
