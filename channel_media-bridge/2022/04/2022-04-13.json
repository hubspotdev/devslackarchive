Did you include any form of authentication with the request?\n\nFor most of the Media Bridge Apis related to configuring the app, we require developer api keys (<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/faq/developer-api-keys|docs on developer api keys>) to authenticate requests. Once you have that key, you can include a query parameter  `?hapikey={key}` and that should allow you to register and configure your media bridge app."

Can you try to use something like curl to see if we can isolate the weirdness we are seeing to an issue with the docs?\n\nHere’s an example curl:\n```curl --request POST \\\n  --url <https://api.hubapi.com/media-bridge/v1/798202/settings/register?hapikey={youApiKey}> \\\n  --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\"\n}'```"
