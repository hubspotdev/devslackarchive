For example, if I have created a module displaying a repeater of linked PDF files that I would like to include in another module for visual display but don't want to repeat code (I want to avoid a maintenance nightmare), what is the best way to do this? I have come across older articles, but nothing for the most recent design manager. Is there an \"include\" type statement?",
