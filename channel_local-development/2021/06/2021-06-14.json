Unfortunately I'm never going to be able to analyze your code, inspect your site, or piece together a solution to a complicated multi-faceted issue. What I can do is talk about concepts of the HubSpot platform and often point you toward some useful related resources. Hopefully over time I will be able to help troubleshoot issues developers run into. To get started feel free to ask me a question like \"what is a theme?\", \"How can I make my site faster?\" or \"How do I install the CLI?\"\n\nI'm new and very much still learning, so I apologize if I don't always answer your question correctly but the more conversations I have the better I will get over time."

If you use the Design Manager \"Live preview with display options\" tool for a template, as you save changes, you will automatically see them reflected in the rendered output of the template preview. To view the live preview of a template, select Preview &gt; Live Preview with display options within the template editor of the Design Manager. ```\n"
