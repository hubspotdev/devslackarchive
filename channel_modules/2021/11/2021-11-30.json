    "text": "<@U02NVBTKCKF> Ahhh well a few things — looks like your css declaration for the background image is inlined css — which is loading after what youve just added. So at the same level of specificity - the new declaration isnt taking effect. To fix that you can just make the new declaration more specific. So instead of `#blog-footer`   You could say `body #blog-footer {...}` That should work.\n\nYou could also add an important flag to the style, but that would make it more difficult to override later on… so I wouldn’t recommend it.\n\nLastly you have `background: 0`  instead of `background: none;`\n\n``` @media(max-width:768px){\n     body #blog-footer {\n      background: none;\n    }\n}```"
