    "text": "Is there a way to get a meeting link through an API or something based on the contact owner of the contact? So let’s say we have a chatbot to extract some more information from the contact, and on the last step we want to send a meeting link so they can schedule a meeting with their contact owner. I can do this with some workarounds and custom properties, but I am curious if there is a better way of doing this."

    "text": "Hi everyone, we are developing a membership portal using HubSpot. Along with subscription plan, we also have 2 more criteria(Chapters, PPN) based on which the amount to be paid will be calculated. For Ex: If a user purchases Monthly subscription ($20), and chapter 1($100) and PPN 1($100) then the total payable amount will be $220. When auto renewal happens, the  user should pay $320 and not $20 which is subscription fee.\nis it possible?",

A error message indicates that \"Tag not found by slug\". I am niot sure how can I fix that issue. Anyone can kindly provide with the solutions please?\n\nALSO, how come those three tags are all the same for all the blog posts. Isn't it supposed to be dynamic?\n\nExample blogpost: <https://www.realtimenetworks.com/blog/smart-police-lockers-make-police-work-easier>"

    "text": "Hello everyone! I'm having a problem with the HubSpot API as of today, as it won't allow me to link my HubSpot account to my app and it keeps loading without giving a response. It seems that the problem is in the function api_client.auth.oauth.tokens_api.create_token(), because I receive the code in the URL but when it has to create the token it never creates it and throws an 'EXPIRED_AUTH_CODE' error. I have not made any changes to the code and yesterday everything worked perfectly. I have checked that the HubSpot servers are up and running and they are. Any help or someone who is experiencing the same?"
