    "text": "Hi all, any thoughts on this? We’re trying to set up our theme so that we can automatically assist the users with WCAG (when they pick a dark background color the text will change to a light color).\nThis works very well on a module level, but since every time you drag a module into a drag &amp; drop area it wraps a Section around it.\n\nThe issue is that the section doesn’t seem to be customizable - do we have no way to add/remove fields on Sections? (see attached image for module vs section)\nWe can customize Sections on a template level, but that doesn’t help when it doesn’t apply when the users drag in new modules beyond what we defined in templates.\nThat leaves us currently with them using our background-dropdown in modules, but then presented with a ‘default color picker’ when setting background on the Section.\n\nIs it possible to ‘ignore’ sections and have modules go full-width if it’s no way to add custom fields to Sections?",
