    "text": "i don’t know if this is helpful, but there is “quirk” with HubSpot that once content gets connected with a particular module, it is locked to that module until the end of time. I tried chaning the module paths, even keeping the same field names for a module, and the markup never updated. I have had to go through and manually replace then modules and copy over the content from each instance of the module. So if the module is on 12 pages, I have to dup the content for those twelve pages, one at a time. Really frustrating, but I have talked to support, and this is a functionality of the CMS that would take a lot of hustle to rectify"
