Cracks me up though.\n\nFor now - good news is you can use emmet in your local code editor of choice.\n\nRight now it’s not a high priority, since if you want emmet, you can already use it locally.\n\nWe’re currently setting our eyes on bigger more impactful changes right now.\n\nWe’re certainly listening for feedback. If folks want this: I’d recommend starting an idea forum post, linking to it from here. The upvotes give us a way of tracking true demand for it."
