    "text": "Hey All, quick question:\n\nWe have a redesign client moving to the CMS, but their current site's domain contains some API endpoints in addition to their site, delineated by directory rather than subdomain (i.e. <https://example-site.com/api/endpoint> rather than <https://api.example-site.com/endpoint>). They are asking if we can leverage URL redirects on HubSpot's end to forward requests to the old addresses to a new location, but when I tested in a sandbox portal I always got a 403 error. I'm assuming this is because CMS Hub only allows GET requests and denies all POSTs, but wanted to confirm.",
