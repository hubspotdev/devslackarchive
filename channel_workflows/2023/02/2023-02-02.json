    "text": "We learned how to use workflow custom action to access the HubSpot api and define outputs and see them show the output when testing.  We then try to add a Send Email action after that, but it appears the workflows system doesn't allow sending email this way.  Why don't you make it possible to have the output be wired as an input to the send email action so that we don't have to use the transactional email add-on instead.  It seems like HubSpot has forced the purchase of the add-on in this situation.  Is that true or are we missing something here?   We need to access data in a more complex way in a custom object due to limitations of how our customer's data is represented.  Our customer is a pretty big HubSpot account, we're trying to automate integration with their oracle database, and its almost done.  If you need to direct message me for more details, that would be fine.  Thank you!",

Maybe you can write out this a bit more into a document and then we can review it and talk more.\n\nThat being said — It sounds like you need to create contacts for these users in HubSpot. Then enroll them in a workflow to email them. If you want to use workflows to send emails, they are a 1:1 relationship. Contact workflows trigger on contact property updates. So if you wanted to email someone on X days later, you would create a contact, or update a contact in HubSpot on a date property. For discussion, lets say this is “Send Email Date”, you would push todays date into that contact. Then a workflow on that date or X days after date, you could send this email.\n\nIt also seems like the biggest issue you have is your data source. It might be worth exporting those as CSV files of the objects and importing them. Once they are imported, then you can build out the workflows you need to associate the records to each other, and then you can look to improve upon them. It might be worth not worrying about the sync right now until you get the base of this up. Diving into the deep end on this stuff can really get you into the weeds."
