We use to have this ability intermittently I believe in the past. I see 2 use cases for this:\n1) If we are working on a template and don't want it to appear as usable by the HubSpot user yet.\n2) To clean up what templates show up to the user when creating a new page, but not requiring us to actually delete the templates from the portal.\n\nDefinitely coming from an agency perspective here so can understand if the broader use case wouldn't support this.",

I can’t say for certain (insert HubSpot internal confirmation here) but I would imagine that a significant portion of template , page, and module use comes from agency (and or consultant) work when setting up a HubSpot instance. The client (end user) would greatly benefit from whoever the expert is being able to clean up the portal to be as easy as possible for them to learn and use."
