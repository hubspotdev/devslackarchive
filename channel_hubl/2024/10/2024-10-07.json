    "text": "Hi! I just joined this group. I'm working in a HubSpot that has two HubSpot business units. We are trying to set up private content through a separate business unit (new logo header and all) so that it isn't branding the wrong company. I was told that I might be able to find help here. What I understand is that I can edit these \"templates\" in under actions, but I need help locating the specific lines of html that illustrate the logo header as I'm not that well-versed in html. Can someone help with this?\n\nI asked this in the random group as well, but I think this is more of a HTML + HubL question"
