    "text": "Hello,\n\nI have written a Joomla plugin that fills out a form on Hubsport using the API.\nI have set up a private app for this and send my data via POST using the following URL:\n\n<https://api.hsforms.com/submissions/v3/integration/submit/portalId/formId>\n\nAs long as I use a local development environment under Localhost / PHP 7.4 or 8.0 and submit the form, everything goes without problems and I also find my form submission in HubSpot.\n\nIf I now put the page online with exactly the same code, I get a 404 error from HubSpot without any further error information.\n\nAmong other things, I have already opened a support ticket, but I had hoped that they might be able to help me here.\n\nMany thanks"
