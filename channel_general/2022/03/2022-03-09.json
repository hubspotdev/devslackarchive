    "text": "I’m looking for a way to manage subscriptions (e.g. subscribe or unsubscribe) *without* actual e-mail.\nFor example, when you get marketing e-mail, at the bottom, in the footer there is a *link* to manage subscriptions page. I’d like to embed that page into a webview inside an application. However, the trick is how to get that link?\nOn HubSpot Ideas Forum I see the same request (generate URL to access subscription preferences page) but it’s status is: _not currently planned_ since 2017! I guess this is not going to happen anytime soon, sadly.\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Generate-the-URL-for-a-specific-contact-to-access-the/idi-p/22909>\n\nThus, as a workaround I have created Unsubscribe landing page which is connected to a workflow that can unsubscribe customer.\n\nYet, I’m wondering if there is a better, easier or preferred way to manage subscriptions? My goal is to have this embedded directly in mobile phone app.\n\nAny help?",
