    "text": "Hi team.\nI have developed a custom theme for a client, but their Google Ads stopped running a week after we went live.\nThe theme is quite simple and has no complex scripts on it (apart from the menu toggles, accordions, and such DOM manipulations)\n\nThe message on the google dashboard is a strange one, Google Ads is disapproving ads because it’s listing Malicious Software: <https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6020954?hl=en#311>\n\nCould it be that there is a script on HubSpot causing it? I have spent more time than I’d like to admit on this, but can’t seem to figure it out.\n\nAny help would be appreciated :pray:",
