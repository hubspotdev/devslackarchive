I'm semi familiar with WordPress, and you were able to create a child theme to extend and enhance a theme.. any help or documentation around that would be much appreciated!!",

We don't have any themes in the marketplace quite yet, but if you've purchased any (non-theme) templates or modules already, you should be able to either edit them directly in the design manager or again use the CLI to download them and edit them locally"
