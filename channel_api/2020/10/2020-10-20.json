It seems v3 would require 2 API calls to fetch 1 set of contacts, and the process seems a bit roundabout too.\n\nI checked the legacydocs and decided to move to deals v1 API for this case. It provides simple solution for my case, and it seems to have some advantages over v3.\n\n- 'since' parameter to fetch deals created after a particular time.\n- 250 records fetched in 1 API call along with associations, while v3 fetches 100 records and requires 2 API calls (to include associations).\n\nWould this be addressed in v3? I don't understand why the 'since' parameter has been removed from the deals v3 API. And would v1 be deprecated soon?"

So halving that would still only be 250. If I set the max for 1000, I get 1000, but HubSpot quadruples the values (meaning I'm still only getting 250 unique values). I should have 340 companies.
