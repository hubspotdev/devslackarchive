The slow in growth is partly artificial - there are 14 users of the beta version of the extension(those people have the extension disabled or uninstalled to prevent conflict). Thank you guys for testing! _As always - remember rating the extension increases it’s visibility, increasing the number of users, increasing the number of people interested in contributing, and inspiring those who contribute to contribute more._"
