    "text": "I use custom fields for this type thing, I let editors turn on/off modules, add in module content (forms, CTAs... etc.), use fields for colours, styling (e.g. add a class around the body post div)... etc. The beauty as well is that the content in these fields is tied to the post and the content can be pulled into new templates. I have an example here: <https://www.stephanieogaygarcia.com/HubSpot-website-development/adding-custom-fields-to-HubSpot-blog-posts>"

    "text": "<@UBUNBSM24> Hi Stephanie, I wish I had checked Slack earlier, I stumbled across this functionality this afternoon, I had no idea it was possible to access custom blog modules from the listing page! I spent a bit of time dumping out JSON objects trying to find the properties I needed. Your idea around using custom blog modules is a great one and up until now I would never have thought of it, thanks for your help!"
