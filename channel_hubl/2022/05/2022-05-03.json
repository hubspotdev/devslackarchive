I’m familiar with the icon field and can see some `name` formatting discrepancies like you describe between the field’s different environments. Can you provide a bit more context on what you are trying to do, particularly the context for switching the icon format to unicode and the embed you mention? And any more details on the environment you are trying to render the icons in would help me troubleshoot this issue with you. Thanks in advance!"
