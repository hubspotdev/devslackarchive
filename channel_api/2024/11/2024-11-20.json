The \"Export\" endpoint is limited to <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/api/crm/exports#limits|30 exports within a rolling 24 hour window>. Do you all know of any way that he could have access to a test instance with a higher limit? Alternatively, could he have access to a higher limit if he used more than one private app token? The 30-a-day limit will significantly increase his dev time.\n\nI already reached out to their HubSpot Customer Success Manager and she directed me here. Thanks!",
