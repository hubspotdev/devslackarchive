When I try to reconnect, I get a \"waiting for the debugger to disconnect...\" message. Is there a way to force disconnect or something? How do I fix this? Refresh doesn't do it.",

Alternatively, you could look at all of the running `node` processes on your machine and try to narrow them down to the one running `hs project dev` and terminate that."
