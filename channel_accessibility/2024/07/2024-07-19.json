    "text": "Hello HubSpot Team!\nI am running a project of setting up a Knowledge Base in our company. Our app is Microsoft-based and we want to place the access link in the tool itself. Redirection works, but can we also protect the HS Knowledge Base link from external sharing and avoid the additional registrations process in HS for our users? EG., we used to have a KB on Share Point and if the link was shared with someone who didn't have an email address registered in our AAD (azure) they were automatically re-directed to Mictosoft login page, hence only our clients could have accessed it.\nI was just wondering if you have any ideas that might work in case of integartion with cloud based app? Thank you!"
