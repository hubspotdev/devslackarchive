    "text": "Hey Daniel,\n\nI actually ran into a similar problem over the weekend. And drove myself insane trying to fix it. Was convinced I'd done nothing wrong and it should be working.\n\nI tried to duplicate existing themes, tried the boilerplate and tried building a theme from scratch. Could never get the theme to link to any images.\n\nThe same issue was happening with the fields.json, where the theme just wouldn't recognise the file.\n\nI raised a ticket with HubSpot and turns out there was a bug affecting these things specifically. Which has since been fixed me, sometime yesterday afternoon. So this may have resolved itself for you too, by now."
