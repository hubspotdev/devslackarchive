    "text": "Hello Everyone,\nI'm wondering if there's a good way to target iOS devices specifically in my CSS file. My navigation menu is rendering differently between iOS and Android devices (specifically the\n`left: 50%` piece). I've tried a few standard methods (see below), but they haven't worked... so I'm looking for some other ideas. Here is a link to the nav menu: <https://www.attigo.com/>\n```@supports (-webkit-touch-callout: none) {\n  .mobile-header-container-new button#mobile_menu {\n    right: 0.5rem;\n  }\n}```\nThank you in advance! (edited)",
