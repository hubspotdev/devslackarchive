    "text": "Hi All,\n\nI am developing on VScode and have added the necessary highlighting extensions. (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HubSpot.hubl>) This is working as intended for highlighting, however on saving a file the formatting is very cluttered. Just wondering if there is a Prettier extension or something similar I am missing to help with the formatting?\n\nAt the moment I have turned formatting on save off and doing it manually, any advice on how to automate the formatting :slightly_smiling_face: ?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",
