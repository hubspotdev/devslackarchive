    "text": "I have run into an issue with the CLI. We're building a theme in a portal and when I use `hs fetch my-theme my-theme` it all works great. However when I create a new file such as an image or font and then call `hs upload my-theme my-theme` I get an error. The error looks something like:\n```failed due to a client error. Unable to create folder: Conflict CachingHttpResponse{statusCode=409, body={\"status\":\"error\",\"message\":\"A folder already exists at this path\",\"errorType\":\"FOLDER_DUPLICATE\",\"errorTokens\"```\nIf I rather upload to a different folder that does not exist it works 100%.\nI am using version 3.0.2\nAny ideas?",
