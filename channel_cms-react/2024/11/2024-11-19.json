    "text": "Curious what others thoughts on this are...\n\nAt the moment, if you link a `Project` to a `GitHub repo + branch`, it prevents the use of `hs project upload .` , giving an error like:\n\n```[ERROR] Couldn't run `hs project upload`. The source for the `PROJECT` project is managed by `USER` through the `REPO` GitHub repository. To continue, remove the link between this project and GitHub in the project's settings.```\nI think there are still instances where you may want to \"force push\" a hotfix (or something like that). Should manual deployments still be achievable?\n\nAlternatively, I know that there is a GitHub action _`HubSpot/HubSpot-cms-deploy-action`_ - I don't know if this works for `projects` or just `themes` - but potentially that could be a way around this problem... since I don't think it would result in this \"linked repo\" error."

The docs seem to imply I need to setup an `OAUTH App`, but the sample repo is too old for me to run (both locally and failing in `Docker`)."
