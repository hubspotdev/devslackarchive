    "text": "Thanks, Tom, so to summarize this - because you can now create custom user properties on user object, you would like to be able to fetch those through context. Did I get that right?\n\nUnfortunately, we may not add a lot more into context, but we are thinking of some better native options that allow you to fetch the first party data easily. We are still in brainstorming stage, so your use cases are handy, and I will keep you all posted through product updates!\n\n<@U07AF9L3G12> <@U04FYBV18UE> since you upvoted these, would you mind sharing your use cases?"
