To display as check boxes in the page, you can iterate the list of values from that column. Also you can get all the available values for that column using `hubdb_table_column`  HubL function and check it against the list retrived for each row."

I need a field where i can make a list for every car separately, i can not predefine them like\ncar1:motor,pump,wheel,\ncar2:manual, automatic, some simple text about the car,\ncar3:some other specific about the car\n\nand all this to be shown as a check box on the dynamic page"
