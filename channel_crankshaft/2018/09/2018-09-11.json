The most similar thing I can think of is Shopify’s Timber Framework. Other similar projects would be Foundation by Zurb or Bootstrap.\n\n<https://github.com/TheWebTech/CrankShaft>\n\nThis project is open source, we encourage contributing if you like the idea.\n\nWe’re just starting it so there isn’t much to see. we’ve currently just forked the COS Boilerplate we’ll start building on and changing from this starting point. Feel free to invite people, this isn’t a secret society."
