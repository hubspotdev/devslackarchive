    "text": "Maybe in theme.json or in the theme editor UI? I figure it'd make sense to apply the (new) defaults only to freshly created elements.\n\nI mean, the problem is, now if I create a fresh row/column/section whatever structure by dragging modules onto the board they all get 20px left and right padding (or something).\n\nIt's just a chore for me to set those to 0 as I usually want, but the content editor people are perhaps unaware or miss small details like this, also I've had to answer the question \"why is this element not aligned top\" too many times :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nOf course I can also provide scaffolding but tbh marking up dnd areas is not super suave nor foolproof if people remove those things or just go haywire outside the scaffolding."

I did some testing on a blank theme and the theme that has been giving me gray hairs has CSS applied to the dnd-columns and that gets inherited (as it should) to those columns so you can forget about this whole thing.  Next time I'll author this myself (and know where to look)\n\nThanks anyway!"
