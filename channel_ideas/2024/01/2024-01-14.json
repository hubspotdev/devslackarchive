    "text": "Hi,\n\nI created a blog, and in that, there's a section called 'latest articles' with a module. I cloned the same module to create another section called 'all articles.' Both sections have default pagination. Now, when I click on the pagination of 'latest articles,' it affects the 'all articles' section. However, the intended behavior is for 'latest articles' pagination to work independently. How can I fix this issue?\n\nIn addition, when clicking on the 'All posts' link, it redirects to another page where only 6 out of 11 posts are displayed. For the home page, I want to showcase 6 posts in the 'latest articles' section, so I adjusted the total post count to 6 in the blog settings. Unfortunately, this adjustment is also impacting the 'all' page. How can I display all the posts on the 'all' page. Does anyone have any suggestions?\n\n<https://www.highroadsolutions.com/highroad-solution-blog>"
