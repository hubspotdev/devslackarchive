So I just want to confirm what I would like to do before I pull the trigger. I was able to \"Clone the theme\" and apply that theme to the five new pages. What I would like to do now is change the menu/navigation that theme is using in the global header to the new menu/navigation I create. Doing all of this I should be able to keep these five pages as an \"Intra Net\" that the person would click around on. Am I correct? Mainly I want to make sure that the updates I do to the global header on the cloned theme only affects that cloned version of the global header."
