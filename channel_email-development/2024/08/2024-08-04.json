    "text": "Hey HubSpot community, I'm quite new to HS development and would like to modify the email preferences template. If the user clicks the ‘manage preferences’ link on an email, it’ll take them to the ‘update email preferences’ page. At the moment, all existing subscription types are listed and have already been ticked. I’d like to make it so only the current subscription type is ticked. How can I access the subscription type the user is part of?"
