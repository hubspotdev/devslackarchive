Actually, I do not even see the \"Add\" tab there and based on the error in the terminal, they seem to be unsupported in the Blog. I found this post on Community forum -&gt; <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Drag-amp-Drop-functionality-for-Blog-Posts/idi-p/408909>\n\nWhile it also suggests that currently, it is not possible, I got confused by this message there -&gt; *The only way to achive this right now is a custom module with all possible content types and pre-defined layouts and a repeater function.*\n\nWhat does it mean? :face_with_raised_eyebrow:",
