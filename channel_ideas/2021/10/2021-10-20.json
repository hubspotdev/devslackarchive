    "text": "We have unique URLs we have imported as contact property values for different users. We then send these URLs via email to the users with the appropriate property token. When we do this we a) Do not get click analytics for the URLs and b) Are not able to add the URL to text (for example instead of \"view your report here\" with the link embedded within the text we can only insert the token as the URL outside of text which is long and ugly.) I'd love to be able to insert unique token link into text like any other link and also be able to get click tracking information."
