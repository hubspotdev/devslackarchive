The issue I'm having is that I need to add a containing div around 3 posts at a time. Is there a way to do this within the posts loop? My container ends up wrapping every post. Would I do this with loop.index or is there another way to make this happen? Basically I need to be able to say - for every 3 posts, add this container around those posts",
