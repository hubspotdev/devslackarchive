    "text": "Hey BJ, this is not ideal, but not a bug.\n\nSo it turns out this is actually a result of how our module system works. We hear you that this is a bit painful.\n\nThe way our module system works, our posts only store the data if data was saved to it. Because nothing was changed in the fields it’s using the template defaults. If template defaults were not set, it’s using module defaults.\n\nSo… that’s basically the reason it is this way today. I’ve relayed this internally, we agree it makes it a bit hard to do some things with the API especially if you don’t know what that default state looks like.\n\nAddressing this requires a substantial under-the-hood change to revamp it, as well as new safe-guards. (for example if you did get all of the default content back, and you used the API to get data from a post and wanted to update just 1 field, but you send back all of the data, you would then change every field from being it’s default to be set to a value.)\n\nUnfortunately while we’re looking at addressing it. It’s not a change we can quickly roll out."
