    "text": "Hi, I am following this as it seems we have a very similar issue on one of our islands. It's the book meeting area so it's quite critical function for us. Last Monday (10th) it was down (they island failed loading), and today (Monday 17th) was again down. In preview from editor everything seems to work fine. The issue is in the published page.\nThe fix is just pressing the editor 'update' button, but ofc not really ideal to have unexpected downtime, is there any investigation possible to take around this?"
