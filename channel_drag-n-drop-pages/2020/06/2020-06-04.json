I have gone into global settings and changed my colors, fonts, etc. However, I want to be able to have the website menu stay visual on the page as I scroll down. How do I accomplish this or what snidbit of code can I apply to this page for that function to happen. I also want to be able to remove the green hover color on the top bar navigation. \n \nPlease help Thank you in advance."
