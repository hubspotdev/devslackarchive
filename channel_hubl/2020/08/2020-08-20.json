Otherwise hubl doesn't know which blog you're aiming for.\n\nsetting the blog:\n```{% set blog = blog_recent_posts('default') %} \n\n// if you have mutliple blogs replace default to the blog ID you're using```\n\nYou should also create a for-loop to grab all the tags.\n\nI'll come back later and give you a more detailed code"
