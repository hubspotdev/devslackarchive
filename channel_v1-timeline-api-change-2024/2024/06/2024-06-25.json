    "text": "Hi <@U04B32JHTUZ>,\nWe actually have a few cases we're working on for different customers.\nThe conversations we're looking to bring into HubSpot is happening in channels we \"own\".\nThe first step is information stored in HubSpot for use by for example Sales reps. Here we have a few projects. I can provide you with a more detailed business case if wanted for one of the projects we're close to implementing into HubSpot.\nAnother case is coming later this year the interaction will start with the GPT, but in cases a customer care rep would potentially take over. For this case we were looking at the Conversations Inbox as a possibility. In this case we're also planning to implement the other scenario with just storing the Conversation, as it will have high value handling any inquiries later in the process. Again I can provide with a more detailed business case(s) if needed to get access to the private beta"
