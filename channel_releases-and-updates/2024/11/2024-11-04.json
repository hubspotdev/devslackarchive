There's also an option to opt in for follow-up conversations indicated on the form.\n\n_Please note that this ‌form is only for feedback and shouldn't be used for specific questions or support._ \n\nAdditionally, we’re working on a two-way update process scheduled to launch in the first half of 2025. This will offer more transparency about how your input influences HubSpot's future. :bulb:\n\n*Ready to share?<https://developers.HubSpot.com/feedback| Check it out here!>*\n\n—The HubSpot API Tooling and DevRel Teams"
