    "text": "Hello everyone,\nI'm a developer new to this platform.  Does anyone know if there are limitations on the amount of times you can use the menu() function on a single page?\n\nWe are having an issue where our secondary nav will not render on the client site, and occasionally the primary nav will be missing some items.  When we print the results of the function on the page, as you might expect the navs that aren't rendering are not returning results.  When we delete one of the menu function calls, then one of the 'later' functions will actually render and return results.  This is why we're wondering if there's a limit on the number of calls on menu()? Anyone experienced this before?\nI've attached a photo of an example of the code just in case we are overlooking something, and I can also confirm that the menus do exists on the site.",

I would start by commenting all that out (in .image-block) and see if anything changes I'm going to guess not. Then I would start by adding object fit there but you may need some other adjustments. Here is a good explanation of how it works. <https://css-tricks.com/on-object-fit-and-object-position/>"
