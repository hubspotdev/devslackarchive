I've followed <https://designers.HubSpot.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-modules> and pasted the module code in to the template as explained in step 13. But all I get is a missing block in home.html - see screenshots. <@U7SL518D6> am I missing something obvious? Step 13 says replace the module, I just commented it out (I think I've done that correctly) and pasted in the code in Step 13. The module itself previews find in Design Manager.",

The problem Derek is running into is between using a template leveraging DND areas vs. a regular HTML template (with HubDB values inserted where needed).
