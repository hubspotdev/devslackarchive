On one site it’s causing a client to get really frustrated with us. I’ve added a bunch of HubSpot URLs to their approved domain list and it worked initially but now it’s broken again - oh and to make matters worse, the issue doesn’t affect everyone all at once - it appears to be affected by however HubSpot’s CDN works, people accessing the site near me get the same result, people a city over are likely closer to a different cdn server and are getting the problem.\n\nJust wondering if anyone’s found a solution to this, because it’s really frustrating for both us and our client.",
