I’m going that route bc I need to customize a theme module, but I don’t want to recreate the module design every time just run tests. I can target just the staging and the remove the page id to make it go global once I’m happy with the changes. Thanks!",

How do I disable the current custom module footer? \n2. How can I create a new global footer using drag-and-drop? \nAny help is greatly appreciated! Thanks.",

If you are using <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/templates/drag-and-drop-templates|drag and drop> template then you can remove footer from it directly.(but I suggest to clone template first and do the changes on cloned template to be on safe side) \n2. You need to create <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/templates/drag-and-drop-templates#global-groups|global group> for this and then you can easily add widgets (modules) to that global group"
