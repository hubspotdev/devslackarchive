Also comes with the side benefit that if JS is disabled browser based lazy loading still works."

You would also likely notice when going under site settings that it tries to add a URL path convention communicating the language/locale.\n\nI am doing some digging internally but the jist of this feature is that it’s a way to easily provide localization for your modules across languages. I am still looking into it, but my current hunch is that it’s only supposed to be active on sites that have multi-language pages."
