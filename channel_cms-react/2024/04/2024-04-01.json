    "text": "Hello there, I've deployed a module built in react on my HubSpot account. I can see it in my content editor when I search it and use it from there but I don't see it in my design manager. I've also uploaded the hello-world-theme from the cms-react github repository and I face the same issue there. I can see the theme folder but I don't see any module there in my design manager. I think this is an expected behavior since react modules don't consist the typical html-css-js structure. The issue is: I'm trying to create a blog-post template from scratch and there I want to add this module. The syntax for this code is: {% module 'blog_comments' path='@HubSpot/blog_comments', label=\"Blog comments\" %}. But I can't provide any path here since the module isn't visible in the design manager. Is there any way to solve this issue?",

Try uploading it again. If the problem persists, contact HubSpot support with the error id.`), see screenshot attached. I only changed one small part of a module for this to happen, dev server works fine, very frustrating. Un-descriptive build errors are a still a big issue imo, been using React modules for 6+ months now and still there haven't been many advances on this front. I tried re-uploading 3 times and same thing happened.\n\nI don't even get an error in the log trail, I get a \"Done\" message.",
