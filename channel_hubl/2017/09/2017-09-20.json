I took another look into this with my team to see if there is an alternative workaround for you, but currently I'm unable to find one specific to your end goal because it involves personalization tokens. That being said, I can see that there is a lot of ideas about this that have been submitted on our Ideas Forum, and as a result, our developers and product team is revisiting this to see if there is anything they can do to ensure that moving forward, HubL filters and functions can be used on contact or company personalization tokens in emails. As this is currently in the discussion phase, we don't know when this will be implemented per say, but I can see that it is currently on the table for our team."
