    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. We are seeking assistance with an issue that has arisen following our transition from using Hapikey (v2 version) to a Private App (v3 version) for our API calls. Since making this change, we have encountered a problem with tracking Google and Facebook leads in our HubSpot contacts list.\n\nPreviously, when we used a [specific code], tracking for contacts originating from Google functioned correctly for v2 version. However, after switching to v3 version, the tracking no longer seems to differentiate properly between Google and Facebook leads. Instead, [specific code] appears to aggregate contacts from both sources under a single filter in the HubSpot contacts list, particularly under the \"Original source drill-down 2\" filter option.\n\nCould you please help us resolve this issue so that we can correctly track and differentiate leads coming from Google and Facebook separately as we did before?\n\nThank you in advance for your help and support."

    "text": "Hi, anyone else experiencing issues with the HubSpot API? At my company, we use the HubSpot Email APi to send in email content and send emails via an external tool via our HubSpot account. We have been using this API with no issues for quite a few years now, but all of a sudden we are getting the following errors:\n\nmessage\":\"The rate limit for this endpoint has been exceeded.\",\"status\":\"error\"\n\nwith no ryme or reason. There is no policy given in the response as to why it has been rate limited and it is causing us issues with our Editorial content emails getting sent out to our users across all of our publishing brands.\n\nThe endpoint in quesion:\nmarketing-emails/v1/emails/{{emailIDhere}}/publish-action\n\nWe have the API rate add-on, so we can do:\nBurst: 200/10 seconds\nDaily: 1,000,000\non our API calls, and we are WELL under that limit, yet we are constantly getting these errors with only a small amount of emails getting sent out if we are lucky.\n\nWe use a Private App to make these calls to our account with oAuth, and the volume of calls is in line with what we have been doing now for some qutie time. There has not been any increase that would justify this error whatsoever. Today for example, we have made just over 200 API calls, and every single one fails on that one endpoint - causing the content coming in from the external system to just sit in draft, as it fails to do the publishing/sending of the email.\n\nSupport haven't been much help yet, and I have also posted this in the developer forum and raised with out account manager, as this is a serious issue for us",

I'm using this endpoint to fetch data:\n`<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/feedback_submissions?properties=survey_id,record_id,response_date,respondent_project>`\nWhile stakeholders are able to export this data into a file format, indicating that the data exists, my API calls aren't returning all the expected properties. For example, here's a typical response I get:\n\n```{\n    \"id\": \"47448785650\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"hs_createdate\": \"2022-07-13T07:44:31.294Z\",\n        \"hs_lastmodifieddate\": \"2022-07-13T07:44:31.294Z\",\n        \"hs_object_id\": \"47448785650\"\n    },\n    \"propertiesWithHistory\": {},\n    \"createdAt\": \"2022-07-13T07:44:31.294Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2022-07-13T07:44:31.294Z\",\n    \"archived\": false\n}```\nAs you can see, it doesn't include the properties I specified in the query. We have about five custom surveys created; does this endpoint not access all survey data, or am I missing something?\nHas anyone else experienced this issue, or does anyone have advice on how to ensure all custom properties are returned in the API response?\nThanks in advance for any help!",
