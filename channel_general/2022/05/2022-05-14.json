    "text": "Hi all, It is fantastic to have this resource!  I will be creating private apps for our account moving forward but have an initial question not related to development, I hope that is ok.  We are setting up a round-robin calendar booking link for our sales team.  I wanted to have the link something like domain/companyname/demo rather than using a specific users meeting link.  I have created a separate user just for meetings.  Do I have to assign a paid seat for this user (which will be there JUST for round robin meeting links) or should I be setting this up a different way? Thanks! (if there is another way I should be asking these questions, let me know)."
