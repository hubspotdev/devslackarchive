    "text": "Heyo. I’m currently creating a property listings module that pulls data from a custom object and iterates through it for each listing.\n\nI have it generally working, getting all my properties and putting them where they need to be… but I can’t for the life of me figure out how to access the attachments on the object record to get the URL for an attached image. I’m currently using a call to `crm_objects` to get my data and as far as I have been able to tell I can’t get the attachment data from there… \n\nIs this even something I can do with HubL or am I going to have to write some JS to deal with this?
