Just plug in “ticket”, “deal” etc.\n\nWith the big caveat being, I’m pretty sure it won’t give you label data. Just the default.\n\nAlso, I’m pretty sure they more or less stopped enforcing/supporting cardinality options. Everything ends up being created as a many to many (there are a few exceptions to this rule when it comes to HubSpot created associations). Though, depending on the direction, the association ID will be different, which might be what you meant."
