    "text": "Hello! I am a Salesforce consultant that is looking to set up a custom integration between Salesforce and HubSpot. I realize there is an OOTB integration that can be performed between HubSpot  and Salesforce, however, this will not meet my clientâ€™s needs. If I was to implement a custom integration between the 2 systems, am I able to define a custom mapping between the HubSpot Contact Email field and custom Salesforce field? Natively, the SF Lead/Contact native Email fields map to the HubSpot Contact Email field. Instead of this, I want to map a custom field in Salesforce to the standard HubSpot Email field. Is this possible?",
