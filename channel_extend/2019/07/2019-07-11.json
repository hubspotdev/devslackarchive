We will try to let you know if you are selected soon after. Topics can be on API use or building for the CMS - basically anything HubSpot development related.\n\nI can say from speaking at HubSpot’s developer day 2018 it was a purely positive experience for both myself and my company. We are still getting new clients almost a year later because people watch the video with my talk in it."
