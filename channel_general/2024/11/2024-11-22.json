    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI'm working on tracking email events through the HubSpot API using the following endpoint:\n`<https://api.hubapi.com/email/public/v1/events?recipient=xyz@abc.com&amp;eventType=SENT&amp;limit=100>`\nMy approach is to use the `sentBy` ID as a unique key to match events for `OPEN`, `DELIVERED`, and `SENT`. For example, if the `sentBy` ID appears in both `SENT` and `DELIVERED` or `OPEN` events, it indicates that the email was first sent, then successfully delivered, and eventually opened by the client.\nHowever, I am encountering a discrepancy where HubSpot UI shows the event as \"DELIVERED\", but according to my logic, it should be marked as \"OPEN\".\nCan anyone help resolve this issue, or should I consider using a different API or approach to track these email events more accurately?",
