    "text": "&gt; <@U2H3TT8F2> <@U01J52DNGH2>. I sent our HubSpot Sales rep a heated email last night on this. We've been using the custom code feature in beta and on July 1st, several workflows stopped working. $800 for a workflow code action is absurd! Considering I can do it in Zapier for a fraction of the cost. This bundle and pricing needs to be re-thought.  I can see rating limiting the number of apps or custom properties through the sync feature.  However, the code, webhooks and formatter actions should be part of the starter package, as I can say $45 per month is worth it and comparable to Zapier. But $800 is way out in left field. It seems like the new model has been to bundle new features into yet another pricey addon or split into another Hub with it’s own separate pricing. It makes it much harder to evolve with the product when the cost increases exponentially. This is opposite of HubSpot’s philosophy to delight customers and I can say I’m not a fan of the direction the hub pricing is going. Pricing seems reminiscent of the cable providers where your forced to buy 160 channels to get the one channel you want to watch."
