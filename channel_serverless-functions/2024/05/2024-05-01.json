    "text": "Hey folks, anyone know this?\nA while ago I updated a json card to a new one leveraging react, but I uploaded the whole bunch as a new project, including a new private app with scopes and access token. But now I find that the serverless function is still using the old Private app for making API calls to HubSpot. In the code there's only a reference to the secret, but I can't figure out A) where these are managed and B) how to update that to use the new Private app's token. Because I want to get rid of the old project/private app.",
