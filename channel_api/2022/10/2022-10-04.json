I have written logic that allows a user to search for all Contacts in our account by distance to an address.  I can take this list of Contacts and create a static list… but I was curious if there was a way to setup a custom Active List filter.  I noticed we already had a few third party integrations that have List filters in an `INTEGRATION FILTERS` category.\n\nWhere would I find the api documentation for creating such a filter?  Is there an easier way?\n\nThank you!"
