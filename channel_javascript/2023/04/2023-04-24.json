    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nQuestion about HubSpot Forms. I create a GTM and I want to give the HubSpot ID when the form is submitted. This is my script for the form that I have:\n```&lt;script&gt;\n$(document).ready(function() {\n var HubSpotId = '{{ contact.hs_object_id }}';\n  hbspt.forms.create({\n   region: \"na1\",\n   portalId: \"{{ hub_id }}\",\n   formId: \"{{ module.form_field.form_id }}\",\n   css:\"\",\n   target:\"#HubSpot-form-wrapper\",\n   onFormReady: function($form) {\n    $('input[name=\"HubSpot_id\"]').val(HubSpotId).change();\n   },\n  });\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;```\nBut if there is a new person on my website that is filling in the form, the contact.hs_object_id is not being created yet and wonâ€™t being shown after submitting the form. Is there any way I can implement a delay before really submitting my form so the contact.hs_object_id is created and I can implement that in my new parameter HubSpot_id.\n\nThanks in advance.",
