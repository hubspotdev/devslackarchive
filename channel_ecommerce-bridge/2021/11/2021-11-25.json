    "text": "Hi <@UMEGEQ1GS>\n\nTo do this, we are going to have to make some API calls. If that makes you stand back in fear, don't worry, it isn't that hard. \nFor something like this, I recommend using a <https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/|postman>\nYou will also need to grab your portal's hapikey which can be found in your settings. Instructions <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/integrations/how-do-i-get-my-HubSpot-api-key|here>\nNow that we have the tools, let go to work\nIn postman, add the following to the address bar:\n<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/pipelines/deals?archived=false&amp;hapikey=>\nafter the hapikey=, this is where you will add your hapikey.\nWhen you are done, it should look something like this. Do note that we making a get request\n\nWhen you click send, you should get some results in the body like this:\n```{\n    \"results\": [\n        {\n            \"label\": \"ServicesTraining\",\n            \"displayOrder\": 2,\n            \"id\": \"2916807\",\n            \"stages\": [],\n            \"createdAt\": \"2020-07-10T19:40:02.178Z\",\n            \"archivedAt\": \"2021-03-22T20:25:34.454Z\",\n            \"updatedAt\": \"2021-03-22T20:25:34.454Z\",\n            \"archived\": true\n        }\n    ]\n}```\nYou are interested in the ID. Copy that id number somewhere.\nNow go ahead and delete the unwanted pipeline as you normally would in the UI.\nNow get on back over here to postman. Let's recover that pipeline that we want.\nThis time we are going to patch with the following\n<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/pipelines/deals/id?archived=true&amp;hapikey=>\nAgain, add your hapikey to the end here. And right before the ?, replace id with that id that you saved somewhere. \nNow, below the address bar, click body. In here, choose raw and then change text to JSON.\nYou should see an area where you can type below. Add the following:\n```{\n  \"archived\": false\n}```\nThis is what it should like. Lots of green boxes indicating all the pieces discussed above",
