    "text": "Hey everyone, I was wondering if anyone could help me. I recently created 2 new custom objects and I want to associate them with already existing companies and deals. Do you know if there is a way to do this in bulk? (for example; when I import a list of new contacts into HubSpot it automatically associates them with a company through the company domain name). I am a data scientist so i know somethings about code, but I have never worked with http posts/requests etc, that is why I am a bit lost. Hope you can help!"
