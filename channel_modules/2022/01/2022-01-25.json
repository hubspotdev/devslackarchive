Thus I create a simple module with a rich text field and said template as the default text in my rich field and have added it to my `blog-post.html` file.\n\nEverything is there as it should be, the only issue is that to edit this text I now have to use the sidebar or the expanded view. Is there something I have to do to be able to edit the rich text field as you would by default with the editor directly in the page?"
