I don't see anything in the CMS React docs spelling this out, but I can't add Developer Projects to my PAK scopes and I can't figure out what to tell my admin to add to my permission set to get access. I'd rather not give all devs in the org super admin access, but I just wanted to know if that's necessary.",
