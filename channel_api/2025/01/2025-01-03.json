    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI’m currently working with the HubSpot Users Search API and need some guidance. My goal is to filter users based on their team ID. In the API response, I see the following fields:\n• `\"primaryTeamId\": \"55685825\"`\n• `\"secondaryTeamIds\": [\"55681645\"]`\nI need to retrieve all users associated with a specific team ID, whether it appears as their `primaryTeamId` or within the `secondaryTeamIds` array.\nCould someone guide me on how to structure the query to achieve this? Additionally, if there are any other APIs available that can directly provide the team members for a given team ID, please let me know.\nAny suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you!",

    "text": "Thanks, Deep Nayak. The API is returning members, but it only provides the main members. It does not include secondary members, such as those who belong to one or more teams. The users in these teams should be considered secondary users, but they are not being returned by this API.\nAdditionally, the IDs I am receiving from the data are different from the IDs returned by the API `<https://api.hubapi.com/settings/v3/users/sample@gmail.com?idProperty=EMAIL>`. This discrepancy might be because one API is from the settings, and the other is from the objects.\nIf that is the case, I need another API in the objects to retrieve the ID via email so that I can use the objects user API.\nLastly, could you please guide me on how to retrieve secondary members from the API?"

For example, if we search for the string \"809548,\" can we use an API call to delete all emails containing that string in the HubSpot inbox?\nThank you for your assistance!",
