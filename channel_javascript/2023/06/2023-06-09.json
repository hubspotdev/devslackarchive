    "text": "Hi everyone, any help would be appreciated, am hoping this is a quick thing:\n\nMy goal is to send the visitors email as a postback pixel parameter to my affiliate management tracking system (everflow).\n\nPage 1: has HubSpot form where user enters and submits email address\nPage 2: thank you page with the code below in \"Settings - Additional code snippets - Head HTML\" area\n\n`&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;`\n`EF.conversion({`\n   `aid: 3,`\n   `email: params.get('email'),`\n`});`\n`&lt;/script&gt;`\n\nWhat can I use as native HubSpot code in place of \"params.get('email')\" to get the email of the user on this thank you page?\n\nRight now the above code relies on email being passed from Page 1 to Page 2 through a query string in url which is a PII (personal identifiable information) violation for Facebook/Google.",
