    "text": "Hi all. I'm having trouble using the hsq.push([\"revokeCookieConsent\"]) method in my dev and staging environments. Calling it from non-HS sites. It works in production vs. a \"real\" HS account, while it does absolutely nothing on localhost and an <http://azurewebsites.net|azurewebsites.net> domain against a dev HS-portal. I've added the azure domain to analytics-and-tracing/domains, but it didn't help. I can see a call being done to __ptq.gif?k=30 when pushed to hsq, but it doesn't seem to do anything. (Same goes for the identify call come to think of it...)\n\nAnyone got any good ideas to troubleshoot this?",
