    "text": "Hey everyone, I had a question about grouping fields in a module, if I put an image field inside a group, I can’t seem to access the variable with Hubl. The way my modules are structured requires groups to be nested in groups due to repeaters being used and everything works fine (so far) except for accessing the image sources, which upon console logging, won’t show up in the module object. My compromise is to just use a text or url field where the image source is entered but I wondered if this was in fact a limitation or is there something obvious I’m missing?",
