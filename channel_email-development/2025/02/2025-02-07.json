    "text": "Hi all.\nTrying to use logic in design manager to determine if an icon should show up in an email. This is the code\n```{% if contact.sales_owner_main_phone%}\n     \n     &lt;img src=\"<http://www.test.com/images/telicon.png>\" align=\"absmiddle\"  alt=\"\"/&gt; \n     {{contact.sales_owner_main_phone}} &lt;br /&gt;\n     \n     {% endif %}```\nThe intention is that if there's no phone number in hs, then dont show the icon. Issue is that the icon always shows, even if there's no phone number in the system.\nHow can we write code to determine if a main phone or cell phone field is populated or not?",

    "text": "Hey all! I'm taking over some custom drag-and-drop email template work from a prior developer and am running in to some confusion. Based on the small amount of documentation I have in our email templates repo (not his fault, he wasn't resourced to write the docs!), it seems like he used a sandbox account for testing purposes, likely a CMS developer sandbox and _not_ a standard sandbox because we're not on Enterprise.\n\nHowever, when I try to do the same and attempt to upload to my own free CMS developer sandbox using HubSpot's CLI, I get the error `You need Marketing Professional or above in order to make this compatible with email.`.\n\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to make this work so that I can test using a CMS developer sandbox account? Or is this just a non-starter?\n\nTIA for any help on this!\n\n(<@UEC65BQV8> I came across your post at the link below along the same lines but wasn't able to figure out from the replies whether or not you were able to get to the bottom of it...)\n<https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/CJ5DN6RKP/p1583965958036900>"
