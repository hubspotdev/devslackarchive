    "text": "New idea: Allow for DND Sections to take CSS Custom Properties as background colors like this:\n\n```{% dnd_section\n  max_width={{ context.max_width || 1100 }},\n  padding={\n    'top': 132,\n    'bottom': 132\n  },\n  vertical_alignment=\"TOP\",\n  background_color=\"var(--grey-bg-1)\"\n%}\n{% end_dnd_section %}```\nNot only is this a little nicer for theming and re-using colors, but because CSS properties can change dynamically this would allow for section colors to respond correctly to user preferences like `prefers-contrast: more` or custom light/dark mode switchers.\n\nUpvotes here if you agree: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Allow-Custom-CSS-Properties-for-DND-Section-backgrounds/idi-p/548914>",

    "text": "The ability to hide the number input on a number field whose display is set to slider. i.e.Â through `hidden_subfield` would be good. As it is now, you can \"hide\" the slider by not setting the display to \"slider\", but you can't hide the number input, which can make things look rather clunky when showing both, especially when you combine 2 number slider fields with `display_width: \"half_width\"` . This much cleaner <https://cdn.vizality.com/u/ouTJD1kqHf.png> Obviously one of the downsides would then be that you can't see the exact current value, but I would argue that probably isn't important most of the time in these situations, but it could be remedied with a little tooltip indicator above the selected point on hover / slide like <https://cdn.vizality.com/u/4ptQc4YRRK.png> or <https://cdn.vizality.com/u/zMMhKo9vzH.png>",

    "text": "I think this is needed, but I can see how it can/would be very tricky for them to implement well. It should also cover all scopes, not just section background colors, in my opinion. So, module color fields, gradient fields, section backgrounds, rich content text colors, row and column background colors, etc. This is essentially what their goal with brand colors and being able to select those was for I imagine, but I don't feel like hard-coded colors are enough."
