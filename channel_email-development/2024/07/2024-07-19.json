    "text": "The default width for your DnD templates can be changed. They don't have to be 600px. But last I checked it's a setting that will affect all your DnD templates. \n\nAlso emails can definitely exceed 600px in width and be just fine. For example, many of Google's product emails use 720px wide designs. 600px is just a common safe width that has persisted for a long time because screens used to be small, and UIs used to be overbearing. There's nothing wrong with it, but in my opinion it's safe to go wider if you want."
