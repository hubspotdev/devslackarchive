    "text": "Hi there,\n\nQuite an urgent issue for us as, a client is trying to get these pages created, in order to go live asap.\n\nWe created a module called *Video Carousel - 2019* and applied that module to a template. This template would then go on to be used in 30 drafted pages. At a later date, we cloned the module so that we could create a slightly different variation but, this then affected those 30 pages. From what we can gather, for some reason these 2 modules had the exact same module ID. I didn't even think this was possible, could this be a HubSpot bug?\n\nAnyway, we deleted one of them (which apparently only had 1 dependant, even though it was the correctly named one) and renamed the incorrectly named one accordingly. The problem is, this one even though it still says it has 30 dependants, isn't actually present on those 30 pages anymore when you go to the page editor.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:"
