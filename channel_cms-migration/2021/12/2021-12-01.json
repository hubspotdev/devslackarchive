    "text": "on another subject (but everyone please go upvote BJ’s post above),\n\ni’m importing a blog via CSV. it goes back almost 10 years (yes i know). Many of the old images have gone missing from the production server over the years. The import goes fine, but this (from a HubSpot server) is injected for every *missing* image.\n\nIt looks terrible! is there a way to have HubSpot NOT substitute its own graphic for missing import items?",
