We want to know if there are people who would be interested in testing future updates to the chrome extension by installing a beta version of the extension (you would be able to disable the one you donâ€™t want to use, so in the event something is broken in the beta version you can always safely go back to the stable version). Both extensions would continue to get auto updates. The Beta version would update more frequently but would be more likely to contain bugs because - beta. If interested please throw some emotes in the <#CBBAW6Z3R|community-browser-extension> channel :slightly_smiling_face:"
