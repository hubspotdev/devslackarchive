    "text": "Relatively simple change I think - <http://spin.d.pr/JW1Kk+>\nAll the time I get designers wanting to design custom select boxes. I can implement them but due to HubSpot not including the field type in the wrapping classes I have to target the field name's class. This means for every individual select box used throughout the sites I have to target their specific names. I can't just style all select boxes to look the same. (often to style select boxes to have say squared corners you have to use -webkit-appearance:none;  then that causes the down arrow to disappear from the select box so you have to re-add it using an :after in the input's wrapper)\n\nAll I'm asking for is that the divs for hs-form-field also contain a class that identifies the field type.\nThat alone makes the problem easy to solve."
