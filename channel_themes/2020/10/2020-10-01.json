In our scss files we write out code such as `color: hubl(\"theme.icon.color\");` , which Gulp will compile to `color: {{ theme.icon.color }};` . We're doing a similar thing for our background images, where our code such as `background-image: url(\"'/wasabi-lite-2/images/scroll-top-1.svg'\")`  will compile to `background-image: url(\"{{ get_asset_url('/wasabi-lite-2/images/scroll-top-1.svg') }}\")` .",
