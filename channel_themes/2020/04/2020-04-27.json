    "text": "There is a problem with dnd-area. Setting a background image as section background, if I want to change the background for mobile devices, simply putting a colored background, I cannot do it because the \"image management\" classes of the background image have the parameter! Important and it doesn't work even if I insert in the my style sheet (custom): background-image: unset! important\nAny idea how to solve it?\nThanks",
