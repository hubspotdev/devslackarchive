    "text": "HI all. Wondering if someone is familiar with the HubSpot Bullhorn app. I have a concurrent API sync for Opportunities to Deals going and this app does not recognize that the Deal has already been created. The docs <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/integrations/connect-and-use-HubSpot-data-sync> say that the identifier is “No specific identifier” - pulling up synced Deals there is no trace of a Bullhorn record ID (same inside of the Bullhorn opportunity).  so no idea what it looks for to find the matching Deal. HubSpot support has no idea either. Right now its making duplicate Deals. I noticed that in the mapping setup for app it has an asterisk next to Deal Name which I would think maybe meant it was using that as identifier but A) it doesnt work and B) there is no legend for the asterisk so just a guess"
