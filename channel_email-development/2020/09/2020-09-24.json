    "text": "<@U7SL518D6> Thank you for the insight! Unfortunately no its not something we can just use personalizations for. I need to run an function on my site that generates 9 recommended prodcuts from our inventory based on the HS contacts previous quiz results (stored in our appâ€™s DB).

Thank you again for your reply!"
