    "text": "<@U0227GH7A7M> Hi Tomer, Assuming you want full control over which company record is associated to the contact record, I think you'll need a separate API call to handle the association. Alternatively, you could consider this feature which automatically associates a contact record with a company record based on email domain: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/crm-setup/automatically-create-and-associate-companies-with-contacts>\nI've not used it personally, but looks like it might be helpful."

Or can I just use a tool like Zapier/Integromat to solve my problem?\n\nThanks &amp; have a nice day,\nAntoine,",

I’m unclear on what’s the “correct” way to identify to the logged in user for the sake of both analytics and the chat window. Should I be calling `identify` via the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/events/tracking-code|Tracking Code API>, or using the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/conversation/visitor-identification|Visitor Identification API>, or both?
