Nontheless it doesn't hurt to take a look at it\n• Be creative!

    "text": "If you're working with external devs it's up to you. You have to come up with a solution that works for both parties. From my experience something like a git-repo would be the best case.\nYou have a branch, the external devs got a branch and you(since you're the \"product owner\"/responsible person ) are responsible for merging it all together. The master/main branch will be pushed to HS.\nIf you don't want to go the git tunnel you could think about a second CMS developer sandbox(you can have as many as you want/need) for the external devs and you'll pull the data from there into your cms dev account, merge it and push it to live account once it's done. Possible but quite a headache and not as performant as github (with actions)\n\nThe big downside of almost every mixed(internal and external) environment is: communication. If you don't tell the devs that you've changed something in their code or vice-versa the next push/update will overwrite it. The good thing: You have built-in revisions in HS(don't mentioning Git since it's the main reason for git) so you can always jump back and restore something..."
