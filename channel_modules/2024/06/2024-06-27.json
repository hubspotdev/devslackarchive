    "text": "hi <@U079WQ6M0KY>,\n<http://module.XYZ|module.XYZ> is working only in modules.\n\nWhat you could try is the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/export-to-template-context|export_to_template_context >but I think it won't work neither.\n\nHow about putting this module just in like `{% module 'blog_summary' path=\"../../../module_name.module\", label=\"Show summary\" %}` into your blog template and trigger it from there?\n\nAnother option could be (if you  want it to be global and have access to it) edit the fields.json of your theme and add a simple boolean to it like\n\n```{\n            \"name\": \"show_summary\",\n            \"label\": \"Show summary in blog\",\n            \"required\": false,\n            \"locked\": false,\n            \"type\": \"boolean\",\n            \"inline_help_text\": \"\",\n            \"help_text\": \"\",\n            \"default\": false \n}```\nThen you could try something like\n```{% if theme.show_summary %}\n...\n{% endif %}```\nin your head HTML area (screenshot)"
