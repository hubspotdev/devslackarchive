The version number can be found in the `theme.json` file and its `version` property.\nIs there any way to access this version number via HubL?\nI was not able to find anything in the docs or via developer info."

I feel like this should be obvious but I'm struggling. I have a hubl blog template from a theme, which calls a standard blog-post module. I would like to set the template to have some default content for content.post_body. I thought setting post_body='default copy' in the module block would do the trick, but it doesn't.",
