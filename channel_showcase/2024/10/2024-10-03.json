I haven’t had the bandwidth to dig into it yet, but I might try to troubleshooting it this weekend.\n\nHonestly, I just wanted to get the idea out of my head and create a cool dev tool to show to my developer friends :laughing:. It might turn into a lead gen tool for my agency or an interactive piece for my theme customers with a call to action for the paid version—not entirely sure yet. Just wanted to express the idea in this early version!"
