I use the v3 api to get the engagement properties and I get one back called HubSpot_owner_id which one of our customers us using to attribute emails. I would love a way to get all of these properties on the v1 engagement calls, OR migrate to a newer version, but NOT have to call seperate calls for the different engagement types. Any help here would be much appreciated!"
