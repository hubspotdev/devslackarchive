I want to make sure that we as quickly as possible associate the email to the user on HubSpot if we previously didn't collect their email. is there a GET parameter or something that I can attach to the URL to the \"download\" page that will ensure that the email is associated with the user based on their tracking cookie?",

We can deploy an application just for the client to use if that’s absolutely necessary, but we aren’t even sure it will allow us to do what we’re looking to do. I’ve had no luck finding a clear endpoint.\n\nI totally understand, and I’m not trying to criticize. You guys have your priorities, and I completely respect that, but needing access to parts of the UI that isn’t supported via the API has been a trend for us with HubSpot - I have more than just the above issues. Again, I’m not at all mad, and I mean no disrespect! You guys have plenty on your plates, and there’s no reason providing us with API access should be a top priority. That being said, we’re getting to the point where we’re feeling like encouraging clients to migrate off of HubSpot. Again, it’s no hard feelings, we just want to be forthcoming where we’re at and provide honest feedback if helpful. We’re not making a switch right now, and wanting to avoid it entirely, but is there any intention to have parity with the API and UI in the near future? There may always be a few small things one might be able to do via the UI that they can’t via API, but as it stands, a significant portion of the CRM functionality that we need is not supported.\n\nJust want to make it clear one more time, though! I appreciate you guys, and this is just meant to be transparent feedback regarding where we’re at, not a criticism, as I totally understand that you can’t do everything at once! :sweat_smile:",
