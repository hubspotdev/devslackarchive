    "text": "Hi!  I have a question about accessing a font in a theme.   When I'm in the theme editor, I can assign a font family to a heading, body, or link and once I've done that, the font appears to be available to use for any kind of text in the theme.  For example, if I assign an H6 the font \"Herr Von Muellerhoff\" I can use that font for a p-tag.  However, if I don't assign that font to any text type, the font doesn't appear to be available for use with the theme.\n\nHow can I make the font \"Herr Von Muellerhoff\" available for use with the theme without having to assign it to a specific text type?\n\nI realize I can go through the fonts.json approach or even the font-face approach, but it appears that HubSpot somehow knows the font and it must be somewhere accessible to the theme since I can assign it within the Theme editor.\n\nAny thoughts?",
