    "text": "I'm struggling to find the docs on how to use the `after` or `next` value in subsequent calls when paging through responses from the crm.contacts.basicAPI using the HubSpotClient inside a workflow's custom code snippet. Once I've made a call and I get the value in `after` or the link in `next` , how do I specify `after` in my next call? I've tried adding the value of `after` to the end of the argument list, but that isn't responding as expected. Do I need to use fetch inside a workflow custom code instead of the client in order to make the request to the `next` link instead? Here is an excerpt of how I'm trying to approach this:\n```HubSpotClient.crm.contacts.basicApi.getById(contactId, undefined, undefined, [\"deals\"], false, after)\n    .then(results =&gt; {\n      if (results.body.associations &amp;&amp; results.body.associations.deals &amp;&amp; results.body.associations.deals.results) {\n        after = results.body.associations.deals.paging.next.after;\n        let associations = results.body.associations.deals.results;\n        filterAssociations(associations);\n        if (after != undefined) {\n          return fetchContactDealIds(contactId, after);\n        }\n      }```",
