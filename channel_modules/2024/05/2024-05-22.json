    "text": "Hello team, maybe someone from HubSpot can answer this question to me. I have site where I’m using sliders - slick &amp; glide, i want to remove slick because of jquery and want to remove glide because is not being maintained. I see that HubSpot added a module with a slider and are using splide, but I also see that the latest update in splide is from 2022. I would like to move to a slider that is mantained, but I don’t want users to be adding modules and having multiple sliders on my pages. Is HubSpot recommending splide?",
