Although the docs on getting started are nice, I feel a need for more advanced project examples to actually grasp how it all works. Are the such examples available somewhere? The ones at <https://github.com/HubSpot/ui-extensions-examples> are quite basic.",

It's difficult to be exact since I'm mostly wanting to explore the possibilities right now.\nMy questions are quite general, like \"How do I conditionally render additional cards?\" and \"How do I pass data between my serverless functions?\" If you want a scenario, one thing I was looking into was to add a card with some buttons for support staff, to perform routine tasks easily from one central plats on the ticket - such as closing ticket with default status, changing pipelines etc."
