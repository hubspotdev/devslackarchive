    "text": "Hello!\n\nWe are currently developing our application, which is gradually becoming available to users via a shared link. Our goal is to be listed on the Marketplace by early May.\n\nWe would like to know if it is possible to *submit our application early* to get pre-approved *without making the listing public immediately*. Once approved, we’d like to control the launch timing and only make the listing public on our official release date.\nThis approach would ensure timely validation while allowing us to align the app’s launch with our marketing communications.\n\nI couldn’t find any information on this. Could you confirm if this option is possible?\n\nThanks:)",
