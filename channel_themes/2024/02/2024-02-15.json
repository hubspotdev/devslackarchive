    "text": "Hi everyone, for some reason there ‘background-layer’-classes  set for sections on an clients account.\nDon’t know if it is a new feature or got accidentally activated at some point.\nWith that the sections always get a background-image (with gradient) set instead of a regular background-color (as selected for the section).\nIs there a way to change that back to the normal behaviour?\nDid anyone have the same issue? Or a hint on where to find a plausible solution?\nDidn’t find any documentation on this – and this is causing issues on the website atm.\n\nKind regards,\nAlvin",
