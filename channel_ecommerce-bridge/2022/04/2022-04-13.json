    "text": "Hey team! My name is Ethan and I’m a PM at HubSpot over in the Commerce group. Specifically, I own our Product Library, and we’re currently working on a project related to discounts. I’d love your feedback on naming. We have three objects that are related to discounts, all of which will be available via the API at some point.\n\n• The discount instance - this is what will be associated to an order or deal, it’s the instance of a discount on a specific order or checkout session. It’s kind of like a “line item” in that it is an instance object, relative to a template object (which for Line Items would be Products). For what it’s worth, Stripe, Recurly, and Chargebee call these objects “Coupons”.\n• The discount template - this is what will live in our discount library. These will not be associated to quotes, deals, orders, checkouts, etc. They are templates for generating discount instances.\n• The discount code - this is an optional object that could be associated to a discount template, so that when a buyer enters the code during checkout, it calls to the discount template and generates an instance object on the order/checkout session based on whichever discount template object the code is associated to.\nThe question I have for you: We intend to name the discount instance, `discount` and the discount code `discount_code` in our APIs…but we lack a name for the discount template. Any ideas? Some ideas that have been thrown around are, `coupon`, `discount_template`, `discount_blueprint`. Any feedback?"
