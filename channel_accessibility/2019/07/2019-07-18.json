    "text": "So got a new report from the client from SiteImprove. Basically, on a resource library page we built, we use CTA's that all say Download PDF to go to the respective landing page for that guide. The client says that using the same link text that go to different links is a violation. But, since I have descriptive text above each CTA explaining the guide, that should give the screen reader enough context to be ok with links using the same text, right? It's all for WCAG 2.4.4. and my understanding is that it would be similar to the News article summaries example\n\nSame thing is happening for a blog listing module that use the text \"Read more\"...since they are all going to different URLs but use the same text. Since each post has intro text above it, that shouldn't be an issue"
