    "text": "<@UFNQ623A8> if you actually store the data as a key/value object it makes it really easy to sort. A simplified example would look something like this\n```{% set all_posts = [] %}\n\n{% for content in contents %}\n   {% do all_posts.append({key: content.name, data: content }) %}\n{% endfor %}```\nKey holds the item that you want to sort by and then data still holds all of the content / whatever content you want it to hold. You can use the hubl sort filter to filter it however you need then\n\n`{% for post in all_posts|sort(False,False,'last_name') %}`"
