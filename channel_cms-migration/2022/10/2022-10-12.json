    "text": "Hi, when doing a sitewide update in the Content Staging area, what is the appropriate way to set up the hyperlinks between the pages? If the staged pages are selected when configuring links, then we are able to test out whether all the links are working properly within the staged proof area. However, once the pages are all published live, the links are no longer valid (presumably since they linked to the \".<http://sandbox.hs-sites.com/|sandbox.hs-sites.com/>\" domain instead of the live <http://company.com|company.com> domain).\n\nIs there a proper method to do this so that we can test that all linked are valid in the staged area, while ensuring that once published those links stay functional?",

At least I know now that what you did should be the expected behaviour which definitely makes more sense.\n\nHm.. I'll try it again on my end and see if I can figure out what's wrong. I'm quite new to HubL so I wonder if perhaps I implemented the link module incorrectly (the one that enables the front end \"Content\" selector) -- perhaps somehow it's forcing the links to be absolute instead of relative or something, which might be breaking the dynamic conversion when moving over to the live domain.
