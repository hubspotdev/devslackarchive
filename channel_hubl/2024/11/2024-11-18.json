I want it to display 10 results per page and I want to know how to change the text (\"Next\", \"Previous\", \"No results found\", etc) and styling. I have found this on another template:\n\n{% module \"search_results\"\n          path=\"@HubSpot/search_results\",\n          title={\n            \"show_title\": \"true\"\n          }\n        %}\n\nCan anyone tell me what is the documentation to that module? I found this <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/cms/content/content-search> , but I'm not sure if there are more module properties I can set through HubL?"
