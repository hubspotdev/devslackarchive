    "text": "*Customizing UI of HubSpot Chat*\nDo you guys know if it’s possible to customize the UI of a HubSpot chat bot in order *to use it as an interactive intake form*?\n\nFor example. We want to have clients be able to go to a landing page and fill out a support form that generates a ticket in service hub. We’ve got that. That’s easy. But instead of a form I want to use a bot, so the client feels like someone is talking to them, so it feels more personal, and it allows for the conversation to go in multiple places before a ticket is submitted. I know the bot can technically do that, BUT I don’t want to send a client to a landing page where they have to look for and click the bot in the bottom corner. If it was embedded in the middle of the page, and open ready for them to answer the first question it could totally change the user experience. Any ideas?"
