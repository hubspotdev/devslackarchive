The stylesheet in the Design Manager has all my changes. Has anyone else had this problem and if so how do you fix it? Thanks."

    "text": "Hello everyone, I’ve been struggling with styling a form and I used a site called <http://Belch.io|Belch.io>. It looks better, but it bunches ALL the similar field elements into one style. So all the labels are one size. I’m trying to get one specific field to be smaller. I’m attaching the look I’m going for (made in inspector). I’ve spent hours trying to figure out what to do and nothing seems to work. Any help would be much appreciated. My site is <http://www.tutorup.com|www.tutorup.com> and you can see the form on the home page.",
