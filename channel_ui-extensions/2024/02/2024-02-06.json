There's a few peppered through the CRM that I think would be a nice component to be able to incorporate into an extension. Screenshot of two icons (I think there's a third one... yellow warning icon) that are shown on the import page when when mapping properties to column headers. Not crucial but would definitely be nice to see.",

The much awaited component is here:tada: Introducing our new *<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/ui-extension-components#panel|Panel component>* now available for our React-based custom cards. <https://github.com/HubSpot/ui-extensions-examples/tree/main/multi-step-flow|Here is a sample> to show you how this works (GIF below: see how we augmented our earlier \"Gift a Meal sample\")\n\n*What is a Panel?* A component that will slide open over the main page, giving you more space to present detailed information. It can abstract information, perform data-related actions, avoid crowding the main page, and much more. (Pro tip: Tables & Forms :orange_heart: Panels)\n\nA huge thank you to all the participants of our alpha - your input was very valuable in shaping this component:orange_heart: As always, if you have any feedback / comments / issues please do reach out. Happy panel-ling:rocket::party_gopher:",
