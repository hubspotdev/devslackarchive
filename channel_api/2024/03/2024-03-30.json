    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI want to ask how to get the properties of an object (Deal or Contact). Not only the default ones but also the ones that are created from the user.\n\nScenario:\n\nThe user selects the deal or contact.\nWe get the ID.\nWe pass the ID to our function to call an API that will deliver all the properties of the Object(Deal or Contact).\nWe get the properties and save them as they are for analysis.\n\nQuestions:\n\nWhat API endpoint is responsible for the properties of the Object?\nAre the API separated into more than one API's? So in the case to get them I need to call more than one API to get the properties?\n\nThank you in advance :)",
