    "text": "Today, my employer, Fahlgren Mortine (a HubSpot Gold Partner) launched its evolved brand, along with a new website on HubSpot. This build has a couple dozen custom modules, and almost all of the content, along with a good portion of the styling, is under CMS control. Itâ€™s built on the HubSpot boilerplate and uses a local dev framework I built to be able to leverage SASS and JS compilation in custom modules. Also, lots and lots of circles.\n\n<https://www.fahlgrenmortine.com/>"
