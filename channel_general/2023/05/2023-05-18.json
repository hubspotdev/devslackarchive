The goal is to change the phone number format to include the country code. _e.g. <tel:12124567890|1-212-456-7890>: Dialed in the US; or <tel:0012124567890|001-212-456-7890>: Dialed in Germany._\n\n_Any thoughts on how I can go about adjusting the property to accomplish this or would this require some custom work?_"
