    "text": "Beta Testers - question :question: - the tab title tweak “site name|DM-HS” *do you think it would be valuable if this change rolled out to other parts of the HS back end* and does this way of naming/ordering the title work for every scenario or do we need to tweak it in some way?\n\nThe idea is to communicate 3 things in the title “what site you’re editing|Current tool you’re in, and that you’re in HubSpot.”\n\nThere are things we can do to squeeze long site names in, but I’m not sure it’s a great idea.\n\npersonally for me I would love to have the site name in all the titles because I work on a lot of sites and have time tracking software that grabs URLs and Titles of the tabs I had open so I can more easily and accurately log my time.",

I have some clients that have like <http://prettylongnameslikethis.com|prettylongnameslikethis.com> Which makes it harder to see |DM-HS\n\nI thought about running a script that would truncate the name after x number of characters, then realized I also have sites with long names which are very similar(client has several HS sites where the first 15ish characters are all the same)\n\nSo then I was like - well we could animate the title so you could see the whole thing, but then I thought that’d be annoying if all your tabs were animating the title. plus it would screw up my time tracking software a little bit."
