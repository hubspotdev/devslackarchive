We have actually been talking about creating a tutorial explaining how to accomplish just this - a single membership page that displays data associated to the logged in contact. Happy to provide some details as to how you could accomplish this.\n\nIf you are interested, I would also love to hop on a call to learn more about the type of experience you are looking to build, and talk through how we can help enable it. Let me know if you would be interested in that!"

In this case, we want to display information associated with the requesting contact. Rather than hard coding a contact ID into the first parameter of the function (the id of the object to get associated data for), we are going to pass in a dynamic request variable, that represents the id of the requesting contact (`request_contact.contact_vid`). This way the data fetched is dynamic to the requesting contact, rather than displaying the associated data with a hard coded contact."
