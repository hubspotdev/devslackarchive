    "text": "<@UGDS256JH> - You could spin up a developer CMS sandbox (like AJ linked above - thanks <@U2H3TT8F2> :raised_hands:) - however - you can't easily move entire sites between portals. SO if you built the website in that sandbox, it would be a very manual process (at this moment) to move things over. If it's a small site, might not be a big deal... Just know it may take some time to copy over to your other portal.\n\nThe (likely) better route to go is to build it in the Content Staging area like <@U26BLKGE4> suggested (thanks Mark!). Although this isn't a totally separate environment, it is built for what you're trying to do - redesign a fresh site and easily swap the old-and-new sites when ready. You can learn more here: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tools/content-staging>"
