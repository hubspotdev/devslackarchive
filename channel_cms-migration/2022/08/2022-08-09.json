    "text": "This is a migration from old HubSpot CMS to new DnD CMS using a theme. Need a little input, hoping someone here has some insight! We have a customer who built their website using a template pack (old CMS) and their pages are live (hundreds of them in 4 languages). They want to transition to the theme version (DND CMS). With Content Staging they can create blank versions of their live pages, choose the child theme, pick a template and go...only problem. A lot of their pages are repetitive, so there is no easy way to \"clone\" a page made with the new theme and then just modify the content unless they use the standard page editor (which creates a URL nightmare for unpublish/republish). Any ideas to make content staging work more effectively? We already talked about saved sections, but that still causes you to build out each page."
