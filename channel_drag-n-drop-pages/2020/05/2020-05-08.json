    "text": "I know that there has been a few posts about it in the past but im wondering if there is any additional thought or future to adding custom class names to DND sections?\n\nMore so for quick styling purposes on the content editorâ€™s side. My team works primarily with marketing agencies and we are retooling our old framework to work well with the new themeing capabilities of HubSpot.\n\nIt would be great if instead of needing to adjust toggles for each individual DND section to set background color they could just add a class to the section. This would take a bit of pressure off of their teem to remember all of the color codes etc for their clients and would def speed up web page/landing page builds.\n\nIt would also make it pretty easy to set up globals inside of fields.json so that they can just configure the settings once and be done.\n\nEDIT: to be clear - There is the class parameter that can be added when coding the sections. I am looking for this functionality to be added on the page editor view for content editors."
