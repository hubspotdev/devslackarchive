Do you want to message me privately or both of us to provide more details?\nI know previously, this <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/settings/account-information-api|endpoint> wasn’t supported by private apps. Engineering confirmed earlier this month that the endpoint returns usage and limit for ALL apps.\nAll you need to do is find the appId in `appUsage`.\nThe only thing this doesn’t have is ~`collectedAt`~/~`resetsAt`~/~`fetchStatus`~\n\nOtherwise, have they tried using the response headers with the limits `X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining` and `X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Daily`\n\nThere is also the endpoint through `<http://api.HubSpot.com/api-logging/v1/report/portal-usage|api.HubSpot.com/api-logging/v1/report/portal-usage>,` which returns aggregated private app usage on a given portal."
