Instead of opting out of things you don’t need, most things will be opt-in controlled with HubL variables.\n\nWe’re not at v1.0 yet but that is the current plan.\n\nSo hopefully, the idea being people only enable the things they actually use, and because the framework is HubL based you can change the variables on the fly, so if say halfway through development suddenly you need to add modals, you can just toggle it on, and the CSS classes and JS just start working. If you don’t end up using it, the CSS and JS doesn’t even get compiled so there’s no bloat\n\n<https://github.com/TheWebTech/CrankShaft>"

Google does it too on some of their pages so I promise I’m not crazy lol\n\nRegarding the resizing… I’m curious, who resizes to mobile on desktops other than developers? I’ve seen plenty of sites that don’t even resize under a certain width. Notice google’s &amp; amazon’s homepage. Only if you inspect the page and toggle on the device toolbar (and set it to mobile) does their site load with mobile styling and functionality. They [edit: the mobile styles] don’t even work on resize."
