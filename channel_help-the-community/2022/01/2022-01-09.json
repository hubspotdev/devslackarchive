    "text": "Hi everyone! I'm new to HubSpot CMS and I have a SEO issue I can't fix. When I audited a website, I got several hreflang issues (it's a multilingual site): \"More than one page for same language in hreflang\" and \"More than one page for same language in hreflang\". \nThese issues are only on index pages like \"/blog/\". \nDo you have any clues on how I can fix this??? \nThank you very much in advance!!!",
