I am noticing that some of the the email information for sends is not being sent over in the API. And I am wondering if anyone knows why this is? I cannot seem to find a correlation between why some email sends are sent via API and a couple are not. These are all marketing emails I am referencing.\n\nUPDATE: I think it could be tied to an limit on the API. Does anyone understand how the limit works? Is it saying the API is limited to 300 records per call?",
