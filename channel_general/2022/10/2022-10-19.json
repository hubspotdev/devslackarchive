So would need to be triggered regularly based on certain events which defeats the purpose of subscribing to a topic, will look to use an api/orchestration layer instead of hs"

That way you can copy the file to your other location as well and wouldn’t need Zapier.  Then one copy will save to the HubSpot hidden location and the other will be on your server where you need it?\n\nI think what I’m still not clear on is what you are trying to program or process.  Are you trying to connect to another app to post the file to, a custom location (locally on the web server or a storage server like an Amazon S3 server?).  Or are you just trying to just prevent them from downloading each individual link either via the API, or via the HubSpot interface from the View File Uploads of the form submission data?"
