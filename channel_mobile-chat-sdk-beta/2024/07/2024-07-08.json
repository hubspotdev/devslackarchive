You will need to use production credentials. This _should_ work on emulators too but ymmv.\n\n> Also we use FCM for our internal PNs. Is HubSpot PNs working fine alongside FCM?\nFrom what I understand, yes HubSpot push notifications should work fine alongside FCM. You just need to create a new set of credentials in APNs and Firebase for HubSpot. Also make sure you are using a different topic for notifications. HubSpot uses the topic that is the package name for your app."
