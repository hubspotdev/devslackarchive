    "text": "Hi Pete! Definitely a good thought (we've floated that idea around before), the obstacle there is that there are many existing page fields whose values are page IDs, but in order to have an external link input and a toggle for opening in a new page we'd have to change the data type to an object to contain all that new info. It's not impossible but can get complicated. Even if we leave out the checkbox and made it a single value people would need to potentially change their module code to expect either a page ID or a URL string. Definitely not ruling this out though, I've opened a github issue to discuss this with my team!"
