    "text": "If memory serves me right Google doesn’t take into account quantity of say JS files anymore in their scoring because it doesn’t directly affect CWV in the same way as it did before HTTP2. It still shows up in reports but it’s part of the diagnostics section as one of the gray items if I recall correct.\n\nIt’s kept there with the hope it encourages folks to not say load a bunch of resources that aren’t used in the page. Kinda like if you were to load the bootstrap framework, with all of the CSS and JS on every single page. If you never use the features on every page, you’re wasting resources. It also encourages folks to share code across parts of a page that could be consolidated.\n\nThe key is - give the browser just the resources it needs to render the current page at the time it needs it, and if possible give the browser cues to understand how to prioritize loading the assets.\n\n&gt; (loading of ctas, server speed).\nOn our end we have some work going on related to CTAs  but I have no time frame or details to share at this time.\n\nServer speed however, there are actually some things you can influence here.\n\nOne of the biggest is making sure your content is cacheable and prerenderable\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/cdn/prerendering>\n\nA common challenge I see folks struggle with kinda related to Googles updates to the weighting of the CWV in lighthouse - it now is 30% of your score. Often the culprit is running a lot of analytics scripts that do more or less the same thing as other scripts on the page such as multiple social media tracking codes, multiple Google analytics/tag manager scripts.\n\nEvery script that tracks something on your page adds a ton of event handlers that need to be set up right away at load time. A good example to get the idea across is HotJar. HotJar “records” every action a user takes on a page, how they scroll around etc, they generate heat maps and let you watch playback of what the user experienced. All of that requires tracking a ton of different things from clicks, to mouse movement, scroll percentage, etc.\n\nAll of that needs event handlers set up at load. Where things get a bit crazy is if you have scripts adding event handlers for things that are already tracked by other scripts. You’re effectively then duplicating efforts on the client side of the site, instead of intentionally having just 1 event listener and then reporting that data to all of the tools that need it.\n\n[I am not saying not to use any particular tool, I am only saying be conscious of what that tool needs to do to give you the data, and consider whether that data is even going to get actively looked at/reported on]"

    "text": "On the server side bit, if you use the `?hsDebug=true` query parameter on any page and view the comment that gets generated. OR use `?hsDebugOnly=true` You’ll notice we list warnings and errors in your templates. These warnings/errors also display inside your Design Manager on the template or module level. Resolving those will often speed up rendering of the page.\n\nYou can see a breakdown below that list of errors of the amount of time it took to render different parts of your page. You’ll notice in most cases it’s ridiculously fast, most modules and partials taking under 10 ms.\n\nBecause we prerender this part is less important because the only pages significantly impacted by the rendering time are pages that can’t be fully prerendered. Pages that are prerendered are effectively static assets. So they don’t need server side rendering, they’re ready right away for the CDN to ship straight to your site visitors."
