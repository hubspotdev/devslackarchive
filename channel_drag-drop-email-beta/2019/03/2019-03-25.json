Maybe the internal fix the internal HubSpot dev teams made took additional time to populate across all portals? Either way, glad its working now.\nThanks for the insight about the rich text blocks as well.\nWe had some troubles with images in emails, but were able to resolve most of them by uploading better sized / higher res images.  If we have any issues we can't resolve through that method or the `?noresize` parameter, we'll reach out to support. Good to know about the image resampling engine, excited to test it out."
