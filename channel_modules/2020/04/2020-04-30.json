I always used to do this by setting the value chosen in Module A in a `&lt;span id=\"something\" style=\"display:none\"&gt;{{ module.something }}&lt;/span&gt;` then you can read that from another module via JS and do something with it. It’s a bit brittle, but it can be helpful in certain scenarios. There may be a better way!"
