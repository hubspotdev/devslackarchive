    "text": "Hi. Looking for someone to help us attack our SEO recommendations in HubSpot CMS and get our PageSpeed score up. Primarily the developer side of things to increase page performance where possible. For example, here are the top recommendations we’re looking to resolve:\n\n1. Reduce how long the page is blocked from responding to user input\n2. Reduce page layout shifts\nThe entire site is built in HubSpot CMS, so we’re looking for an expert! You can see where we’re lacking in performance :slightly_smiling_face: .",
