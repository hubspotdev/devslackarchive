    "text": "Interesting. They must be doing something like trying to constantly track the state of the design manager. Thatd explain why the <#CBBAW6Z3R|community-browser-extension> doesnt cause significant performance changes.(its all mostly 1 way only thing it needs to check state for is if the header menu has loaded to properly inject the dev menu). The dark theme and ux tweaks is all css so it just flashes styles momentarily but after that itd be as performant as just another css file loading(thats permanently cached)"
