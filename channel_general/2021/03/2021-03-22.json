    "text": "For anyone that might try searching something similar to what I tried to ask and search for, to no avail, earlier on - making a simple POST request via Zapierâ€™s Custom Code functionality using fetch:\n\nInputData.sponsor_id that can be found in the request body in this case is info captured via webhook in HubSpot in an earlier step. Note how it is entered in the input fields provided by Zapier above the code.\n\nThis allows me to make a query to find a contact with a property value matching inputData.sponsor_id. I now plan to take the returned contact object data and associate it to the object initially pulled in through the webhook.\n\n Hopefully this saves someone a few hours of fumbling around.",
