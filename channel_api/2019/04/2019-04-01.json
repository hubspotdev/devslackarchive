Now I want to modify the json data as the third party   uses OpenAPI and have some required json fields that HubSpot form Json data do not have. To add some fields and modify json response I thought of using proxy  in between. Also, I found that HubSpot does not allow reverse proxy. So, how can I achieve this ?"
