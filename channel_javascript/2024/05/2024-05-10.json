    "text": "Hello everyone, this is my first post, and I appreciate any guidance!\n\n- *Context*: We're using a HubSpot landing page designed to drive opt-ins for a webinar. However, we prefer using an embedded form from WebinarGeek.\n\n- *Issue*: The WebinarGeek form lacks UTM tracking support. Consequently, our Meta ad conversion tracking through HubSpot isn't functioning correctly. All contacts are currently marked as Offline Sources due to the nature of the WebinarGeek integration with HubSpot.\n\n- *Objectives*: Maintain the use of the WebinarGeek form (or somehow leverage the API of HubSpot or WebinarGeek or both) while implementing a solution that:\n  1. Emulates the behavior of a native HubSpot form submission.\n  2. Restores functionality to the Meta ad tracking module in HubSpot.\n  3. Ensures conversions are not recorded as offline sources.\n\n- *Current Progress*:\n  - I have placed a HubSpot form alongside the WebinarGeek form and hid the form with CSS.\n  - Managed to store UTM values from the URL into the browser's local storage.\n\n- *Stuck Point*: Need help progressing beyond storing UTM valuesâ€”looking to effectively use these values for tracking and store them alongside the WebinarGeek form submission in HubSpot.\n\n- *Request for Help*: I'm open to other ideas or approaches that might help achieve these objectives. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated!",
