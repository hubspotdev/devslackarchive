    "text": "Hi everyone! I have two questions I 'm hoping someone can help me solve.\n1. The Figma design kit shows that the 'Alert' component can be multi-line, but I don't see that as an option in the component documentation. What property should I be using to achieve the multi-line effect?\n2. I'm familiar with the `onCrmPropertiesUpdate` and `refreshObjectProperties` actions to trigger a refresh of the card when a property changes, but is there a way to trigger a refresh based on an association? General use case is that we want the card to update automatically when a custom object is associated with a deal. I know we can add a button for the user to refresh the data (which would trigger a query with GraphQL), but is there a way to do it automatically when an association is added? Anyone have any [automated[ workarounds if it's not possible?",
