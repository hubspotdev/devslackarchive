    "text": "Hi everyone, I hope you are doing well!\nIn the last months, I have been facing some issues with the incoming logs to n8n (self-hsoted).\nSo basically I monitored the outgoing logs from HubSpot and the incoming logs received from n8n workflow\nWe always received the half of logs (more less) sent by HubSpot\n\nThe actions we tried in order to solve:\n• we implemented PUB-SUB in order to queue the incoming logs, but also here there was number discrepancy \n• We tried to route the HubSpot events to the cloud version, but also here there is a discrepancy, but from what I saw a bit less, but still there.\nWe are speaking about 10k events approximately each week, so not so many.\n\nTO note:\nWe have other use cases where the events coming from Salesforce are ALL logged, even with self-hosted and pub-sub\nMaybe here there is an issue with HubSpot side, wdyt?"
