Subsequent requests will serve the cached version and they’ll all see the same resolved shuffle value.\n\nThe solution here is to output all the HubDB data into a Javascript variable and shuffle it using Javascript."

I'm looking to create a way for people to register for online training and have their classes show up exactly like this, however from what I can tell, you cannot associate a custom object to a contact via a workflow. I'm assuming that in this case the \"class\" is a custom object. Aside from manually associating a contact, I'm not sure how this was done. Thoughts?",
