I'm a little lost.\n\nCan I create the app with create-react-app or do I need to start with hs create react-app?\n\nWhen I start with hs create react-app, after yarn start, in which file do I view the application?\n\nHubSpot.config.yml is at the root\n\nIf anyone has an example I would appreciate it :)"
