    "text": "Hello Liz. This is possible there is a rough edge so it's not documented quite yet.\n\nHere is how to do it.\n\nStep 1 - Add contents of `.npmrc` file to hs secrets via `hs secrets add NPM_RC` . The awkward thing here is that secrets can only take a single line string. So if you need to have multiple entries they needs to have a `\\n` character in them e.g.\n\n```//somewhere-else.com/:_authToken=MYTOKEN \\n //somewhere-else-ele.com/:_authToken=MYOTHEROKEN```\nStep 2 - add the `NPM_RC` secret key to your `cms-assets.json` - see <https://github.HubSpot.com/cms-js-building-block-examples/reference/secrets.html>\n\nNow when you `hs project upload` our build server will safely include your \"npmrc\" file during the package installing process. Please let me know if you run into any issues. (edited)"
