    "text": "Hey all,\n\nI need to do a sync between HubSpot and an external tool via API.\nThe external tool doesn’t have webhooks and can’t modify me.\n\nI was going for this solution but it doesn’t seem right and I’m stuck with the limits of custom codes in the workflows:\n\n- A workflow is triggered every hour.\n- It retrieves the last contacts from the api of the external tool.\n- I search in HubSpot if this contact exists via email address. If yes, I update the values with the new ones. If not, I create it.\n\nI explode the time limit in customs code which is 20 seconds it seems. And I’m a bit stuck.\nMoreover, this method is not scalable.\n\nDo you have any ideas or an alternative to meet this need?\n\nThanks :slightly_smiling_face:",
