I pass json data, (or I even save json data to records) and then turn them into objects in the code and work with them.\n\nPassing variables into the next custom code action allows you to have single function code blocks, so it is much easier to determine when an error happens in the process.\n\nPassing variables also allows you to keep the minimum time limit for functions in mind. Only having a limited amount of time for each custom code block, you can avoid timeout issues"
