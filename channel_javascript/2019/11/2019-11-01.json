Jquery is loading in the head of the site and that is the only other dependency as far as I know.\n\n\n\n<https://jackonthe.net/css3animateit/>\nAny help is much appreciated. Thanks.",

What happens is the CSS will hide it on load so you don’t have it snapping in and out. Then when the JavaScript loads or when it comes into view, it will slide into view.\n\nWithout the JavaScript though it just won’t appear.\n\nLet me know if that helps :slightly_smiling_face:\""
