    "text": "Hello everyone and merry Christmas :santa:!\nOur customer's sales and marketing teams are mainly using HubSpot in Norwegian but some of them are using it in English. We've extended some dropdown properties with custom values. When people are using HubSpot in English, all dropdowns are correctly shown in English, but when they switch to Norwegian, the native values are translated into Norwegian (that's nice) and the custom values aren't translated, they're displayed in English (that's less nice).\nIs there any way to have all values translated into the user's language? I don't see how we can add translations when defining the dropdown values.\n\nThank you for your help",
