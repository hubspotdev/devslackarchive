    "text": "Hi, a question on adding companies via API\nCurrently we have an integration that tries to do the matching via emails and domains, but we actually have companies that use the same domain for regional branches.\n<http://bigcompany.com|bigcompany.com> &lt; Asia/Pacific\n<http://bigcompany.com|bigcompany.com> &lt; US\nWhen we try to insert the second company it won't work.\n\nAnother scenario that HS currently rejects is:\n<http://domain.com/asia/en|domain.com/asia/en>  &lt;&lt;\n\nAre there any advice or best practices on this?",
