    "text": "Hi all, just wanting some advice on how to split a blog listing page. It's a single column blog and what I want to do is have the 5 latest blogs, then a container with a newsletter sign up form, then the rest of the blogs. For the top part I was thinking about using the blog_recent _posts function but then would tag filtering work on this and how would I make the bottom listing carry on with the rest of the listing from the latest 5?\nSo layout is:\n• Latest five posts\n• Sign up form\n• Rest of the blog posts",
