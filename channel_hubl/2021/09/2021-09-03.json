With inspecting I mean displaying all the data of the object(s) stored inside.\npprint is only displaying some information\nconsole.log(\"{{ my_tags|escapejson }}\") is just giving an array of names but I cannot inspect the objects.\nIs there some addon I need to install or some kind of way to find out how the objects are organized?\nFor example I know that I can use .slug and .name on it but there should be more\nThank you for your help"
