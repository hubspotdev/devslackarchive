To create a child theme in HubSpot, you need to duplicate your parent theme and make changes to the duplicate. 2. To do this, go to Marketing &gt; Files and Templates &gt; Design Manager, and click on the \"Settings\" button for your child theme. 3. Make sure that the \"Use this theme\" checkbox is selected.  4.Clear your cache and refresh the page to see if this resolves the issue."
