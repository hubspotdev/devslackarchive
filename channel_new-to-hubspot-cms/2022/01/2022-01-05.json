    "text": "Hello everyone! I'm currently trying to finish the HubSpot practicum, and facing some issues when developing on HubSpot as opposed to my local env. Some questions I'd appreciate some insights on:\n1.  When i try to create a template partial, it keeps throwing: `The section can only have one root-level \"dnd_section\" tag`, even when I just have one `dnd_section` tag. \n2. Something I've also noticed is that on local I'm able to start a `dnd_section` tag without a `dnd_area`, while when I try to do the same on HubSpot, it says a `dnd_area` is required. \n3. Similar to 2; I don't seem to need `{% standard_header_includes %}` &amp; `{% standard_footer_includes %}` on my local, but if I don't include these tags when developing on HubSpot, it says these are required",
