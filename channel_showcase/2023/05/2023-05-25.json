    "text": "Hey all - sharing a webinar I'm hosting next week on building apps for the HubSpot ecosystem. We're featuring elite solutions partners who spun off their own app companies focused on building apps for HubSpot. Datawarehouse has hit over 1 million in revenue for their apps while also sending 1 million in services pipeline to the agency they spun out of.\n\nDatawarehouse has gotten to 1 million in revenue with no marketing - all their leads come from the marketplace or HubSpot solutions partners or HubSpot sales/CS. If you're thinking of building apps for the HubSpot ecosystem, should be an interesting conversation on business models, go to market strategy, and what the opportunity is.\n\n<https://offers.HubSpot.com/solutions-partners-building-apps>",
