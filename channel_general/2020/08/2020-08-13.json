Users can send photos and exchange information. All are registered users with HubSpot ID. And we are looking for some solution, some CMS, which could be either added to HubSpot or integrated or whatever, that would allow us to have all the information about the posts, images, comments of this or that specific user.Â So, we would be able to see when he posted, what he posted, whose post he commented and what was the comment. Something like this. Thank you.",

Just one thing- the posts have to be checked by the moderator before allowing this post to be published.

And then we want to be able to check posts, who posted, and to check the contact- which posts were posted by him and to have the data the contact posted. and also the comments he left under the posts of other contacts. So, this could be arranged via HubSpot CMS plus HubDB?"
