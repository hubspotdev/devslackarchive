I initially tested it in our sandbox environment, so now I want to move it to our production environment. While it worked fine in our sandbox account, in our production account I am unable to add the MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN as a secret. I get the error that the secret was not added with no rhyme or reason why. I tried asking the main HubSpot support forum and I did not get any response. There is also nothing about this particular error on the entire world wide web, so this must be something very obscure."
