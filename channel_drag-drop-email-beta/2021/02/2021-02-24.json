I just had a quick question: I'm trying to make it such that an email I send out has the exact formatting on mobile as it does in desktop, just essentially a smaller version. Is there a way to do this? HubSpot automatically reformats to optimize for mobile, and in doing so it drags my sidebar down to the bottom of the email, but I'd instead like to keep our desktop layout"
