We have been having a lot of API Call Errors recently and we are trying to troubleshoot what is happening.\nI know you can go to Private Apps --&gt; PlanHub-HubSpot-Integration --&gt; Logs - API Calls and view the HTTP 400 and 500 errors individually, but is there a better way to see an overview of the errors?\nFor example, one error is due to the option we had in HS was not spelled the exact same way as what was being pushed. So I fixed that specific error, but if I go through the logs manually, I will come across many more with that error, and I don't want to waste time viewing each individual error if it's the same root cause.\nIs there an overview view or list I can use to segment out each error by reason?\nOr, is there a way to export the error logs but include the Body of the Response of the errors? Then I can sort in Excel.\nThanks!",
