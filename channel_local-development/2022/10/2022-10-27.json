Once the user submitted the form, the mail triggers. The download reports have been saved in the *specific URL*. *Each time different users have done the form submission, the download form will get generated and stored in a website specific link.*\n\nNow I need to send out the report form to unique report to unique users\n\nIssue: How to give the *specific website link as input value in the button component in the emailer.?*",

Now, if I want to move back to local and still want to use the latest work I did, what command can I run or how to do I do this. I know people mostly ask question on syncing the remote with local by the command `hs watch`  but I want it the other way around. And I want my local to be overwritten by all progress done in the remote. Please help. Thanks in advance.",
