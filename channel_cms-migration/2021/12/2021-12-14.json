BUT all of the links to files show up like this:\n<https://fs.HubSpotusercontent00.net/hubfs/20499357/1980s.pdf>\nIs there a way to show that these files are coming from their company, and not from HubSpot?\nNormally a DNS connection would change over all of the links, not just page links.",

There’s an option that shows the domain as HubSpotusercontent.xxxxxxxx. Click on it, and choose the desired domain from the drop-down.\n4. Copy the URL, and replace the existing URL in the website editor with the one that you just copied.\nHappy to help over a quick call, if needed.\n\nMy best,\nGagan"
