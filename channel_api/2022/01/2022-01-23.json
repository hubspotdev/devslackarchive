    "text": "Hello, I'm pretty new to HubSpot and a bit confused how to set up things properly.\nRight now I'm building a website on HubSpot, it's some sort of a configurator. The user should put in some informations, based on that I make some suggestions and at the end I want the user to put in his email and a password and I want to create a contact out of it as well as some custom objects.\nSo I don't have a server or anything where I could run server-side code. I store all the informations the user had put in in JS variables and I want to push them to the HubSpot API.\n\nMy Question now is how would I do that properly, since I can't add PHP files to my HubSpot side I guess I would have to use some sort of serverless-functions, but I can't quite understand how those work.\nMy Pseudo-Code would look something like this:\n`function createContact(data)`\n`{`\n    `//Call ServerLessFunction(data);`\n`}`\nSo how would I call the serverless-function and how do I need to set that up?\n\nThanks in advance"
