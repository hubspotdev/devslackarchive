    "text": "Hi everyone! I'm using the nodejs-api for the first time, but I was reading the documentation, and the readme was not updated.\n\nThis readme (<https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs#example-create-contact-company-and-associate-created-objects>) it's using `crm.associations.v4.basicApi.create` to create an association, but the current node API has: `crm.associations.v4.definitionsApi.create` , which has different parameters. Could someone help me create an association with this API version?\n\nI'm trying\n\n```HubSpotClient.crm.associations.v4.definitionsApi.create(\n      createContactResponse.id,\n      createCompanyResponse.id,\n      { label: 'Primary', name: 'Primary' }\n    )```\nBut it's not working and I don't know what is wrong."
