I assume the FOUC (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content|flash of unstyled content>) is happening for the DOM outside the partial (especially for any HTML defined in the HubL template)?\n\nAnd since the partial should be rendering HTML with `&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" …&gt;` directly, then I believe you can move that `js_partial` to the top of the body and fix the FOUC."
