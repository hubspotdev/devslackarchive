    "text": "Hi, I'm working on embedding some forms for a client and was directed here by support. It's a requirement that we be able to pass in the value of 2 hidden dropdown select field on a page-by-page basis. Referencing <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Customize-default-field-values-for-form-Embed-code/idi-p/11483|this> community form, I made the below changes to the embed code, but in all of the form submissions made through this embed I still just receive the default values of the hidden fields I'm targeting. I've verified that the field names and values are correct, and used both onFormReady and onFormSubmit. Issue persists across browsers. I'm not receiving any error message from the hbspot script, and I've verified that the fucntion itself is actually getting ran through the console log. I'm not able to find anything in the current or archived documentation around the embed script on how to perform this action. Would appreciate some direction.\n`hbspt.forms.create({`\n      `region: fRegion,`\n      `portalId: fPortalId,`\n      `formId: fFormId,`\n      `sfdcCampaignId,`\n      `onFormSubmit: function($form) {`\n        `console.log(\"it actually ran\");`\n        `$('select[name=\"field name\"]').val(\"val\").change();`\n        `$('select[name=\"field name 2\"]').val(\"val 2\").change();`\n `}`\n    `});`",
