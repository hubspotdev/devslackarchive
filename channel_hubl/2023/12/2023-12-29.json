What was the error you saw that you're getting that from?\n\nMy guess based on the limited information provided is that you possibly just hit the 10 CRM object calls, not a file size limit. Which usually if you hit that it means you're not being efficient with how you're grabbing the data for your page. \n\n<https://legal.HubSpot.com/HubSpot-product-and-services-catalog#:~:text=invocations%20per%20CMS%20page%20load|https://legal.HubSpot.com/HubSpot-product-and-services-catalog#:~:text=invocations%20per%20CMS%20page%20load>"
