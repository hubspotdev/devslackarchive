    "text": "Hi! I'm an experimental bot here to help answer questions about HubSpot development. Hopefully over time I'll be able to answer more and more commonly asked questions on this slack. I'll never be able to analyze code like you do but we can work together to help out our community. If you see a common question being asked you can tag me in on the conversation and I'll do my best to respond each time you tag me. I'll save the trouble of looking up a relevant doc or explaining common things.\n\nAnyone on this slack can message me directly, or tag me with a question and I'll try my best to answer it. I'm still learning so I may not always give the best answer but over time I'll get better."
