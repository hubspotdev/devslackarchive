    "text": "Hey all, I'm experimenting with the programmable email functionality and I'm running into an issue. I'm trying to show a content block if the price of a deals associated line item is greater than 0. The below works fine:\n\n```{% set x = crm_associations(5304469720, \"HubSpot_DEFINED\", 19, \"\", \"price\", false) %} \n{% if x.results[0].price &gt; 0 %}\n  price is greater than 0\n{% endif %}```\nHowever, the below does not, I'd like to just loop through associated line items to the deal and include this module in an email being sent from a deal based workflow:\n\n```  {% email_each list=\"deal.line_items\" item=\"line_item\" %}\n    {% if line_item.price &gt; 0 %}\n      price is greater than 0\n    {% endif %}\n  {% endemail_each %}```\nYou'll see a screenshot of the error below, appreciate any insights at all!",

    "text": "Hey Zack, I'm still running into a few issues with this ... From searching through previous threads it seems that `email_each` is a workaround that predates programmable email which now allows us to use more advanced hubl in custom modules. See <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/CJ5DN6RKP/p1644206821670899|here>.\n\nHowever, I'm struggling to find a way to reference the deal ID in order to use the `crm_assocations` function so I can loop through line items.\n\nEssentially I want to create a module that will loop through associated line items and I can output various properties in the body of the email as required."
