    "text": "Hello! Wonder if anyone out there can advise - on our website homepage, we have a HubSpot form at the top, just a single email field. Only recently has this started to show an icon in the form field, like it's treating it as a login field maybe? <https://www.unily.com/> See attached a screenshot of what shows on mac and chrome. The second one is showing my browser extension for a password manager app called Keeper but this doesn't show on longer forms eg <https://www.unily.com/get-demo>\n\nAnyone know how to hide the icon?\nAny insight would be appreciated! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThanks\nHarriet",
