The reason is because this is the same HTML that template hubl tags generate. This HTML is used by the page editor to make fields editable inline in the page.\n\nI’ve directly asked a few HS team members if they plan to one day make it possible to edit individual fields inline in the page for custom modules, they said it’s a little ways down the road but yes it’s something they would like to do."
