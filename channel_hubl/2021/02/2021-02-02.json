Before the 'for row', I have created an array called 'uniquebranches', and the 'for row' runs for every individual 'unqiuebranch'. I am trying to output an array of 'tenancy_created_company' values for each uniquebranch. Is this possible?\n\n```{% for uniquebranch in uniquebranches %}\n   {% for row in insightsmaster.allmonths %}\n      {% if row.account_id == uniquebranch %}\n         ## create a new array from {{ row.tenancy_created_company }}\n      {% endif %}\n   {% endfor %}\n{% endfor %}```"

So that array that I mentioned above is blank and you’re pushing items into it. You’re still using the structure you have set up already. Does that make sense?"

Instead x-uniqueArray will only live as long  as it is inside of x-uniqeBranch’s for loop. Each iteration through uniqeBranch means uniqueArray will be reset which is why all of the actions happen at the very end of that for loop once the array has been created."
