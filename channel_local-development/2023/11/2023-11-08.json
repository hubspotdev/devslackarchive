    "text": "Hey there! The loop control you're currently using, `loop.first`, is a great way to skip the very first item in a list, as you’ve discovered. If you want to exclude the first and second recent posts, you need to keep track of the loop index and exclude the items accordingly. In HubL, you can access the loop index using `loop.index`.\nHere’s how you can modify your code to exclude the first two items:\n\n```{% for content in contents %}\n  {% if loop.index &gt; 2 %}\n    &lt;!-- Your code to display the blog posts here --&gt;\n  {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}```\nIn this snippet, `loop.index` returns the current iteration of the loop starting with 1. So, by checking if `loop.index` is greater than 2, you're effectively skipping the first and second posts.\nJust replace `contents` with the correct variable for your blog listing, and the rest of the code where you display the posts will only run from the third post onwards."

I see there is an example that uses this 'ui-extensions-examples -&gt; with-crm-components -&gt; stage-tracker'. I'm going to work through that to figure this out, If I figure out why the original isn't working I'll update this thread. Appreciate your response!"
