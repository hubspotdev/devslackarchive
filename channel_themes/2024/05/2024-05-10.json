What’s the best approach to creating a staging environment on their account as I’ve developed the theme on my HubSpot account. I’m fairly new to HubSpot usually working with WP or Shopify. Thank you for your help :) ",

    "text": "<@ULBP4M3LK> Yeah, here's a snippet from the Absolut theme\n```{% dnd_module \n    \"cta_image\"\n    path=\"../modules/mask-image\",\n    label=\"Mask image\",\n    extra_classes=\"js-slidein\",\n    offset=6,\n    width=6,\n    image={\n      \"src\": context.image\n    },\n    styles={\n      \"fill_color\": {\n          \"color\": context.mask_fill_color || \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  %}\n  {% end_dnd_module %}```\nHere, a module is added to a reusable section, with \"context\" defined for each editable module field.\n\"styles\" module field is the one responsible for styles tab in the module settings. Meaning if context was added to styles field when it was initially added to the section file, it'd be possible to edit whenever you add that section to a template via \"include_dnd_partial\" like this\n\n```{% include_dnd_partial \n      path=\"../sections/call-to-action-centered.html\" \n      context={ \n        mask_fill_color: #000\n}\n%}```\nHope this makes sense :blush:"
