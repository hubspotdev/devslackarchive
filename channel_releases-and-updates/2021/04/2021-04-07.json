    "text": "Hi Marina, thanks for clarifying.\n\nIt seems then that our app is not a good fit for this pilot program. We want our app to be available for everyone with at least a Starter subscription.\n\nCan you help me understand how to solve this:\nWe're building an accounting app to sync data and create invoices for a Swedish ERP-system, and are struggling to understand how we can get similar functions as the Quickbooks integration built by HubSpot and the FreshBooks app.\n\nWe're trying to figure out how to do something like image 1. And from the FreshBooks app, something like image 2.\n\nDo you need custom objects to display invoice data on company records, like the Freshbooks app? And to have a similar flow to creating invoices as the QuickBooks integration, what's required?",

    "text": "Hi <@UBF61JD2R>. Absolutely! Since you are looking at the QuickBook integration and similar features, then I would take a look at the Use HubSpot's integration with QuickBooks <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/integrations/use-HubSpots-integration-with-quickbooks|documentation>.\n\nYou could use custom objects and it is one possible solution. Instead, knowing you are building an accounting app to sync data and create invoices, I recommend exploring the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/extensions/accounting|Accounting Extension API>. Any account can leverage it and you would be able to make your app available for everyone."
