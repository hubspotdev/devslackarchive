I'm trying to get set up with the HubSpot calendar integration on landing pages, but what we're running up against is that our emails use a hybrid exchange environment as we're not fully on Office 365 (in the process of moving over, but it is taking some time). This is causing some issues. The actual email we're trying to connect to a calendar is an office 365 account, but because it's a hybrid environment we're continuing to run into errors. Has anyone run into this issue before? Trying to gauge if this is workable or if we need to find an alternate calendar solution until we're fully migrated to Office 365."
