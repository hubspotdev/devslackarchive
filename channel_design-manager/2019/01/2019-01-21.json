    "text": "Hi Mustapha. I canâ€™t speak for the easy of working with react on HS specifically <@U26BLKGE4> I think has done it.\n\nI will say I do build HubSpot modules that are VueJS components and it works pretty well. For working with HS I think VueJS might work better - just because it was built so it would work okay if used in smaller pieces throughout a page, where as I feel React is meant for if you want the whole page controlled by React."

    "text": "Hey <@UE8RUSAUT>, Jon pretty much hit the nail on the head here. It can be done, but it probably shouldn't lol, especially the way you're describing. One of the biggest roadbocks you'll run into is you can't pass props from module to module in HS, so using it for page layouts doesn't really make sense right now. \n\nIf you have an applet or other embeddible instance, then HS will house it just as well as a plain HTML page; that's been my use-case in the past.\n\nWhat are you looking to accomplish by using a front-end framework?"
