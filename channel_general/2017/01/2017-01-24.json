HubSpot isn’t responsible for updated templates, I would recommend reaching out the provider (Neambo) and asking if they are willing to give them the new files.\nHowever, the templates will come over as new files, not updated files, which will mean that any pages using the templates will have to be replaced with new templates.  This could become ‘tricky’ if there have been any major edits to either the existing templates, or the updated templates."
