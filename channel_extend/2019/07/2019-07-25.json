We’re down to the most exciting parts now though.\n\nThe best part is that all of our effort into this event will provide a framework for community developer events in the future. We plan to make it easy for others to see what we did, improve upon it, borrow any resources we’ve created in the process, and learn from our mistakes and successes. Kinda like it’s being open sourced. If anyone’s interested in running future events, <@U22PKFRU5> will have all the information once the event is over.\n."
