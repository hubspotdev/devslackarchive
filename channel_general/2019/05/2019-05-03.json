First of all, it doesn't seem to work to put divs etc inside the xml-code since HubSpot automatically put all items from the RSS on a new row in the newsletter. The problem is  RSS feed  gets put on different rows through &lt;table&gt;-tags, so we cannot place the items next to each other this way\n\n<http://cultuurwerkt.wezz.io/feed.html>\n\nAs a last resort it seems I would have to trying to put this code directly in the editor by pasting the HTML-source(Hoping to avoid this option)\nAnyway to get it to look like this?<http://tinypic.com/r/34fo8s6/9>",
