I understand that we can code the custom menu in HubSpot.. the worry is more to allowing the site-admin to maintain the navigation on her own.\n\nWondering if we can make use of the HubSpot navigation editor to manage the input data.. like to pick the images and what badges to show?\n\nIn my observation, the HubSpot navigation menu is kind of limiting to do this.\n\nAny idea how to achieve this?",
