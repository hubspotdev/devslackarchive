Anything else requires copying and pasting the code into the field itself or changing the image picker field to a textarea where someone can copy and paste the SVG code. that's at least what I've done in the past, would love to see a hubl function for this but would require limiting image picker file types to svgs"

Even if we could get a file picker that was just called “Icons” or something that only did this functionality, it’d be awesome. I have done workarounds with jquery’s `.load()` in the past when I really needed it to work and couldn’t find a solution, but that isn’t ideal."
