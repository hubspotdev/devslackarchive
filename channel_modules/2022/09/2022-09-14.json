    "text": "Hi Everyone,\nIs it possible to create a custom module that retrieves blog posts when a load more button is clicked? Based on what I have read so far, HubSpot APIs generally do not support AJAX requests because it would exposes any authentication to the client. We can use the Infinite Scroll plugin, but we want to know first if it possible to do it on HubSpot without using any plugins. Any advice on how to this would be much appreciated! :)",
