The TL;DR is we scrape the blog and look for (or allow you to enter) CSS selectors that correspond to the different features you can import (title, author, featured image, etc.) So, as long as the test post you use has a featured image, and as long as there is a distinct selector we can hook onto, it should come over :slightly_smiling_face:"
