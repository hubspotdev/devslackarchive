    "text": "I used Heroku for pet projects. Main benefits are - very low threshold for starters, transparent billing, and pretty chip in my case. For commercial projects I used mainly AWS Elastic Beanstalk and other less managed services. All of the organizations organizations I worked at already chose AWS as their cloud. The reasons to choose it usually are - brand, easier to find people with the skill to operate it, very wide range of services available, reliability.\n\nHope it helps:)"
