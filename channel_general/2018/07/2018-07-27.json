You now get the same file and folder management system within the FTP that you do in HubSpot, and you can create files in your local environment and see them reflected in HubSpot. For all the details, check out this designers blog post. <https://designers.HubSpot.com/blog/now-live-updated-HubSpot-ftp-for-the-new-design-manager>\n\nAlso if you have any feedback on the new FTP, feel free to join <#CBZK16L9L|ftp-feedback>.",
