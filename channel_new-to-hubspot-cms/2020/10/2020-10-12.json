    "text": "Hi Katherine, Themes do require comfort in HTML and CSS. Comfort in HubL will also substantially help in building out your theme. That said starting from the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes/HubSpot-cms-boilerplate|HubSpot theme boilerplate> is a great way to get up and running quickly, without needing a ton of experience building on HubSpot.\n\nIf you’d prefer to work on a team I’d suggest posting in <#C2YGWHDKQ|marketplace> that you are looking for a group and let folks know you’re a UX designer. I guarantee that’s a skillset that almost any team, or even individual in the theme challenge would be excited to have on board.\n\nAnother good place to look is. <https://HubSpot.devpost.com/participants?search%5Bteam_setting%5D%5B%5D=1>\n\nThese are the folks registered for the theme challenge who specified they’re looking for teamates."
