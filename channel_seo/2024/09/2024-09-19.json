    "text": "Hi, I am having issues with bots receiving a 404 error when crawling our AMP and archive pages. We have had this issue before in July and then it went away. Now it has been happening for the last week. There is also another comment in this channel from someone who is having the same issue so it's not just limited to our site.\n\nI attached 2 images. In the first image, it shows the 404 error that is received when GoogleBot requests an AMP page. In the second image, it shows the 200 status that is received when Chrome requests the same page.\n\nMy main concern is that when Googlebot receives a 404 error, it will consider the page to be gone, and will eventually remove the page from Google, impacting our SEO.\n\nDoes anyone know what can be causing this issue?",
