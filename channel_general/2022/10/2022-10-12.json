I have a problem, when a contact coming from Google or Facebook ads submits a form (custom code form in webflow wesbiste) that is parsed into HubSpot by Zapier integration, the tracking is lost. All utm ads tracking data is not linking to HubSpot, which affects all marketing reporting. Has anyone seen this issue before?",

    "text": "When there is an integration involved I have seen HubSpot report the data via an integration as opposed to what you would expect to be the source. The reason tends to be that the integration is not posting it as a form submit, but rather as a new contact created by that integration.  But if the UTMs are mapped over to HubSpot properties you should be able to get around that. Is your UTM being setup as a hidden field in the form that then maps to a HubSpot property?"
