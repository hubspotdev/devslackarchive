    "text": "Hi all. I'm new to HS and new to the command line too so I'm being extra cautious here. I'm experimenting with a sandbox account. I've got the CMS CLI set up, boilerplate downloaded. I now want to set up the watch command to sync my local environment with my sandbox account. In the documentation the watch command is listed as:\n```hs watch --portal=&lt;name&gt; &lt;src&gt; &lt;dest&gt;```\nMy question - which is presumably something I've just skimmed over and now can't find - is where do I get the &lt;name&gt; for --portal=&lt;name&gt;? After that I think I understand the rest: &lt;src&gt; in my case will be 'test-theme/src' and &lt;dest&gt; will be 'test-theme'.",

I have a similar setup, the hs watch *should* be watching my dist directory and it certainly seems like the gulp process finishes prior to the HubSpot upload, but sometimes when I refresh my front end, the sheet seems busted. I may have wrongly assumed that the sheet was being uploaded before gulp. I suppose HubSpot needs to compile the sheet after the upload, so it's possible that I'm simply being impatient there. I'll have to oberve it more. Thanks again for taking the time to write!"
