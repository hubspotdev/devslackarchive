    "text": "If anyone else has this issue and is unsure of a method to stage translated version of a page the method taken from me and my team is:\n\n1. Create staged page\n2. Choose template\n3. Page name and url to this new translated page\n3. Populate page with respective locale content\n4. Publish page to website pages\n5. Assign page (e.g. About FR : /fr/à-propos) to group of default lang in this instance EN so About and this will group the published page.\n\nHonestly this needs improving as translating stuff in HubSpot right now is just unclear for most."
