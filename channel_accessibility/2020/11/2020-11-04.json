The forms team is aware of accessibility issues in the current forms and it is their top priority to address them.\n\nI can’t give a timeline for when updates that address this will occur. We take accessibility very seriously and have many different simultaneous efforts to improve accessibility across HubSpot functionality. We want to ensure we do a great job with this because it impacts so many people, it will be ready when it’s ready. We will certainly announce any changes to the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog|developer changelog>, so stay tuned there.\n\nContinue reporting any accessibility issues you notice, even if we’re already working to address them it can help us influence prioritization."
