    "text": "Hello! Where are you trying to change the font? I'm assuming that you are using a theme, which should have the ability to select a primary and secondary font. Those would use Google Fonts. Then those fonts would be used throughout the theme. HOWEVER, if you are trying to change the font in a Rich Text module, that will NOT pull from the theme and will just give you a small list of stock font options. I do have some themes in the Marketplace where I include a custom rich text module that allows you to pull your theme fonts in. Otherwise, even in a rich text module, your text should pull the font family that you set in your theme unless you override it."

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.
