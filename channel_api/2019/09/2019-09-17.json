To clarify, it sounds like you already have either an email template or a published “Saved for automation” email in your HubSpot account and you’re looking to trigger it with an API call. Is that correct?\n\nIf so, it’s not possible to _directly_ trigger a marketing email send through an API, but if your automated email is part of a workflow, you can enroll the desired contact in the workflow via this endpoint: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/workflows/add_contact>.\n\nThe Engagements API only logs emails, notes, meetings, etc. to contact records — it doesn’t send anything out.\n\nAlternatively, the use case you’re describing also sounds like a fit for transactional emails: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/email/transactional_email>. If you’re interested in a trial for your developer account, DM me."

CC <@UF9EC6WSC> for your use case, though."
