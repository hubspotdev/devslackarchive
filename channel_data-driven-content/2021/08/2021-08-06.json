The main goal is to store data for displaying dynamically in the CMS.  I can build these relationships in HUBDB.   We would also like the products to be stored as Product objects to be used in the CMS.\nShould we maintain two sets of data,  a product hubdb table for CMS use and products in the CRM?\nCan we build relations between Products and a HUBDB table?\nAre there any limitations to displaying Products on CMS pages?",
