Essentially it is a way of calling a macro but youre able to pass the stuff inside of the call block through as a second macro ( kind of) In short youre passing a macro to a macro. But one of them is nameless. Seems like the main purpose is to prevent code duplication but im wondering how folks are using this if at all.\n\n```{% macro dump_users(users) -%}\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n    {%- for user in users %}\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;{{ user.username|e }}&lt;/p&gt;{{ caller(user) }}&lt;/li&gt;\n    {%- endfor %}\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n{%- endmacro %}\n\n{% call(user) dump_users(list_of_user) %}\n    &lt;dl&gt;\n        &lt;dt&gt;Realname&lt;/dt&gt;\n        &lt;dd&gt;{{ user.realname|e }}&lt;/dd&gt;\n        &lt;dt&gt;Description&lt;/dt&gt;\n        &lt;dd&gt;{{ user.description }}&lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;/dl&gt;\n{% endcall %}```\n"
