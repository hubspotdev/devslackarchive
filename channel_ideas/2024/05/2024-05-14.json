    "text": "<@U02094DEMTK> hey I have an idea for the HubSpot code editor. When copying the path it gives you the absolute path which is expected. But in VS code there is a feature that allows you to find relative paths by typing them out starting with a dot in the src or href property. Then the system offers suggestions of what is available at that depth and it allows for nice relative path selection.",
