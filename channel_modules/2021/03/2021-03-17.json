    "text": "• My client has a blog with many existing entries\n• They want to create a post that somewhat deviates from the basic text + images. In this case, it’ll contain a component that contains some statistics\n• This component should be placed midway through the blog post on the right side. There is paragraph text from the blog post on the left.\n• I know I can build this block with a custom HubSpot module, but what I’m struggling with is understanding how I can place it within the “document flow” of the standard *Blog Content* (as opposed to just appending the module _after_ the *Blog Content* block)\n• Is it possible to place Modules within *Blog Content*? I see the editor’s *Insert* button includes some blocks I can insert (Call to Action, Table, Video). How do these differ from modules? Can I create my own one of these that can be inserted within the *Blog Content*?",
