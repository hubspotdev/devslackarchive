    "text": "Hi everyone, one of our clients wants to migrate their 10,000 pages WordPress website to HubSpot CMS. This includes 2,500 product pages with a category taxonomy (not an ecommerce, just unstructured content describing the products + CTAs, currently no prices and no stock is displayed). What would be the best approach to tackle this? can we somehow create \"custom product objects\" like we would do in WordPress? Do we create one page per product or \"master pages\" that are dynamically populated using HubDB and modules?  How do we create an \"advanced search\" module that allows us to filter by keywords/cetegories/tags?  <@U22PKFRU5>",
