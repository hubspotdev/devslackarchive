We encourage individual teams that own betas to recognize the size of the affected audience and level of impact of a change and try to provide a reasonable heads up, but it CAN be less than 90 days.\n\nWe encourage anyone participating in a beta to be transparent with any stakeholders that they are using beta functionality and it is subject to possible change."
