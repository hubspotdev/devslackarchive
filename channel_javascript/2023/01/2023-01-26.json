    "text": "This is a little bit of a brain teaser. A new client of ours asked us to look into an issue their team couldn't solve. Our team looked into it and we aren't sure what is causing it either. I have been working in web development for several years but this one is a little weird. If you look at this url: <https://canvas-hummingbird-co.sandbox.hs-sites.com/test>, first click on Agenda, Travel, or Register Now links in the header result in the wrong places on the page. It works correct if you attempt to click on one of the other links though. The smooth scrolling works correctly. Its only on initial first load of the page and a click on on a link with a hash. We tried to track down where the JS code is coming from to make edits to the smooth transition. We could not find it. We thought maybe this was a built-in feature of HubSpot? :man-shrugging: Any help with this would be greatly appreciated as this issue has stumped 5 developers now and the client is getting frustrated with their team as well as ours.",
