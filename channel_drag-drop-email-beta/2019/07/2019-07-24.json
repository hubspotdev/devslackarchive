Is it possible (or how can you) change the default text styles of drag and drop templates? Specifically I just want to change the paragraph, h1, h2 and link colors so all our emails are consistent. The regular Settings &gt; Marketing &gt; Email &gt; Configuration color options don't seem to match the drag and drop editor.",

    "text": "I had actually brought up something similar to this with HubSpot back when the DnD was still in Beta. I can't find the exact answer, but if memory serves we right, you just have to change the styles every time. Or, you just make a \"template\" email which has all the styles you want, then just keep cloning that email. Never tried it myself, but I assume styles are kept when cloning.\n\nI haven't looked into it recently, but if you haven't already, Id suggest submitting this in the ideas forum as well as telling HS support about it"
