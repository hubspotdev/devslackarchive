    "text": "Hi All! Really enjoying using HubSpot CMS so far, but have a few concerns about its scalability for large enterprise sites. Any advice on if HubSpot can successfully manage hundreds of pages, some that are 3 or 4 paths nested? I have 10+ teams needing to manage either subdomains (more straightforward) or specific site paths (not sure how this is solved). I see there are folders for landing pages, but am confused why they are not available for webpages and why they do not auto-populated the suggested url (would be super useful). I am afraid having 300+ pages for a domain would become extremely unwieldy.",
