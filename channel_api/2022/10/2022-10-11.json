We would make it private but we make use of custom timeline events so we'll have to keep it was public for the time being.\n\nOne thing I've noticed is that there are a number of calls we use which do not seem to be available without using an API key and I was wondering how I can migrate if that is the case. I am potentially just missing something.\n\nCalls are:\n• GET /crm/v3/timeline/{appId}/event-templates\n• DELETE /crm/v3/timeline/{appId}/event-templates/{eventTemplateId}\n• POST /crm/v3/timeline/{appId}/event-templates\n• PUT /crm/v3/timeline/{appId}/event-templates/{eventTemplateId}\nAny help would be greatly appreciated",

We’re also working on some features right now that could make this possible without needing to use an API, which I hope will be available in the next couple of months/by the end of this year."
