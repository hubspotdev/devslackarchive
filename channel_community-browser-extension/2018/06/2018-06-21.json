    "text": "<@U6W3H6YN8> and <@U7ADCU3BM> last night was the Chicagoland HubSpot Dev User Group. Matt Coley invited me to come up after his presentation and show off the extension, funny thing is it kind of tied somewhat directly in with his presentation on performance on HubSpot because of Will’s jQuery in the footer and HS Debug and Google PageSpeed features.\n\nSeemed like people were interested in checking it out.\n\nAlso discovered a new feature to add. another query param button for `?hs_amp=true` Based on Matt’s presentation yesterday, a lot of big changes are coming regarding AMP on HubSpot, and this param is going to make it faster/easier to test AMP ready sites."

    "text": "one thing I’ve been thinking about though it might be over-kill.\n\nConverting the popup to use vueJS as some functionality might require more “state management” for example if people can opt in to themes, or opt into design manager functionality down the road.\n\nConcerns though using something like vuejs - if we move to frameworks like that it creates a barrier to entry for anyone willing to contribute. I would encourage not using a build process like babel either, as again it adds a barrier to entry for contributions. The advantage though is Vue is atleast easy to read even for someone not familiar with it. (that’s why I’d prefer that over something like react).\n\nAs I said, might be total overkill though, and possibly unneccessary depending on how far this extension actually grows out to handle."
