The solution <@U013DLRAAUW> had worked great but I'm running into a new error now. I would love to try to get this running without the beta feature because I'm developing it on my HubSpot account for now but I'll be handing it off to another HubSpot account when I get it working locally!"

However, these paths seem to be incorrect (that file doesn't exist). As such, when I upload these files into the design manager of another site (eg. my dev sandbox), I get errors saying the component has been disconnected and the file can't be found. I know the global group does exist elsewhere though. Has anyone experienced something similar? Thanks in advance!",
