We have an “old school” free marketplace instance of HubSpot that has legacy products on it. We’d like to move that over to another portal associated with our Partner account. We don’t want to lose stats and continue to build on our library seamlessly. What’s the best way of achieving this? Thanks in advance!"

That way if someone views your site in a browser that doesn’t support it they get the png or jpg as a fallback.\n\nFor additional image optimization tips check out:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/speed#images>"
