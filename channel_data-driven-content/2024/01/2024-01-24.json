    "text": "Hello, I would like to see if you can help me, I am working on a project where we have a master/detail page, with the information from two HUbDB Tables, one contains a list of all courses offered by a university and the other the details of each course. You can see the pages here:\n\nList: <https://aprendizajepermanente.udem.edu.mx/>\nDetail: <https://aprendizajepermanente.udem.edu.mx/detalle?u=diplomado-en-analisis-de-datos-e-inteligencia-de-negocios-dain&amp;row_id=153691433582>\n\nIn the example I only have 4 courses, but in total there are 220. Initially I tried to do it with dynamic pages, but it only allowed me up to 10 pages, according to the documentation, more than that suggest to use parameters and that is why there is the url of the detail of that manner.\n\nThe problem is that using parameters in the URL I cannot find a way to measure the conversions of each course, because in the options I have in the workflows the slug parameter is not detected, and it does not give me any other option for this purpose.\n\nIs there any way you suggest to track the conversions that I can apply or configure?"
