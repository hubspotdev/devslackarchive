That’s what the original error that <@URQV7LU79> posted means, this is becaue by default, teh date properties are just for dates, not datetimes.  The second is to change the property youare trying to dupate the falue for (in this case `callrail_date_of_most_recent_call`  to be a datetime property. You can do that by updating the property using this api <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/v2/update_contact_property> setting the `type` property to `datetime` instead of `date`"
