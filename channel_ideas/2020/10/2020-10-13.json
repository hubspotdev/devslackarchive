    "text": "Not sure if the use-case is high or not or if others find it annoying at all. But I have modules that I use that are always full width. No padding  No margins anywhere in the section.\n\nWondering if there would be a way to define a “force full width” attribute in the module someplace that would automatically preset the section it’s being dragged into to be full width? Perhaps this only happens if it’s a new section being created? Does that make sense? Thoughts?\n\nTypically this is happening on various slider modules or Body Banner modules. Where they are the only item in their section. Ive also noticed that a fair amount of content editors sometimes have trouble remembering that they can control the section and column padding and margins. They know what modules to use but then it doesnt look right when they drag it in and they think something might be broken with it when in reality the section just still has padding on it.",
