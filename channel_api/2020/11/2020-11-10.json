    "text": "Okay. Let me try to explain in more detail... let me know if you need more (I am sure I will leave stuff out). We use CW as a post-sales CRM. It houses our agreements, contact records, and procurement records (which are orders we place with Dell and Cisco, not deals we need to sync back to HubSpot). We are looking to use HubSpot for sales only. This is where our sales team would create a deal and associate it with a company. The deal would then sync back to CW as an opportunity in their sales starter module. We are trying to prevent duplication of entering a new deal. So if our sales person starts it in HubSpot, they don't also have to start it in the sales module in CW. We would want the company name and associated contacts in HubSpot to sync to CW when our sales person creates the deal in HubSpot."

Not to complicate things :slightly_smiling_face: but we know the PieSync team a little bit (as well as the Bedrock Data team), having looked at building Connectors for both. If you want to throw our name out there for helping, happy to talk with them about it!\n\nBut yeah either way, if neither platform fits, we’d be able to help on a custom basis"
