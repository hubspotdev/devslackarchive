These are viewed as positive by the Solutions Engineers and CSMs. They believe it shows deeper integration, better leveraging of the HubSpot platform and creates more value for the customer. \nMore to come too when HubSpot releases UI Extensions in Public apps. (No official announcements on that. My words not HubSpot’s) :) "
