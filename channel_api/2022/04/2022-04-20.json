    "text": "Hello team! I am Merve and I am interested in HubSpot APIs and webhooks for live chat. I am totally beginner in HubSpot products and services. I need help and have some questions, I found this community I hope I can find someone. I am working on the chat integration using webhooks and APIs. I have a chatbot and I want to use this chatbot in the Hubsbop live chats. Basically, whenever a new message comes to the inbox I want to trigger a webhook to my end, I want to send the answer from my end to live conversations. I read lots of documents related to webhooks, chat flows, and conversation APIs. However, I could not find how I can set up this. I have already a developer account and a trial test account. Is this possible with the webhooks? I tried to set up a bot from scratch and configure the chat flow in HubSpot. Then I choose the trigger webhook option after the welcome message. Somehow, I see the request on my end, but then the conversation ends, I just could not figure out how to automatize this for each incoming message from the users. I hope I explained my problem and it is understandable, I am truly sorry if my first message on this channel is too long. Thank you!",

So I can not select this app as a connected app for my test account. If I create a private app for my test account, webhook is not allowed for the private apps. I just could not figure out how to proceed with that."
