We're hiring a full-time web developer here at Betterment (<http://www.betterment.com|www.betterment.com>) (based in U.S.) to work on website development using HubSpot (and you'll get to dabble in CRM/integration work too if you want). We'll be building out a fully customized theme over the next 6-9 months. I don't have a public description up yet, but will very soon. Would love to bring on board somebody with a passion for what we do and good solid HubSpot knowledge. DM me if you want to talk!"
