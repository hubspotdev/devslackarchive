    "text": "Hi! I am currently working on a HubSpot project with multiple developers. We are experiencing that module fields keep disappearing, and hs fetch doesnt include the fields.json file to VS code (its beeing skipped, since the file already exists locally). So new modules gets just an empty fields.json locally. Appearantly hs fetch doesnâ€™t see changes, it only sees if there is any *new* files, not *edited* files.  Is this correct? We want to try to avoid having to make the fields.json file manually in VS code, but to set up the fields in HubSpot. Have anyone else experienced this or do you have any suggestions to make this process easier?",
