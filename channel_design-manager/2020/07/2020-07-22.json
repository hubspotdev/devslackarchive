    "text": "Does anyone know of a way to inject additional settings into a column area for the drag and drop editor. I want to make two columns that touch each other, no margin between, but could use some help figuring it out. We are using the default boilerplate provided by HubSpot that uses Bootstrap 2 and this is resulting in a default width for a span6 of 48% width and a margin-left of 2% on all columns but the first one. I was thinking something that could be toggled to override the 48% and 2% margins when checked to 50% width and 0% margin.  See screens for additional context.
