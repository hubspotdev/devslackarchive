    "text": "When an input has Help Text but the input label is long and doesn't fit on one line the icon usually ends up in the bottom-left of the label and that sometimes makes the Help Text tooltip get cut off. Since the input panel/sidebar in the page editor and Global Content editor can't be enlarged there isn't a way to see the left side of the tooltip window in these situations so the people using our templates/modules sometimes can't see important information. I know this is a tricky UI thing to solve for but it would be great if some Javascript or something else could be put in place in to reposition tooltips to be left-aligned instead of center-aligned in situations where it is getting cut off.\n\nAlso, we've never been able to put text here which follows HTML markup and it would be preferred if this text could display as plain text so we could say things like `Wrap your text in <span></span> tags to...` since that would currently show up as `Wrap your text in tags to...`\n\nThese aren't urgent updates but they're ones that have been around for a while. For the sake of our content editors it would be greatly appreciated if someone on the HubSpot team could work on a solution for these.",
