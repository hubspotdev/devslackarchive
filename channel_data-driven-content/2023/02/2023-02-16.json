    "text": "Forms and dynamic pages.\nWe have created functionality to create resources such as courses, whitepapers and much more, through HubDB, utilising the dynamic page functionality - because *there’s a lot* of it (500+ across business units) in our scenario.\nInstead of hassling the editors with creating a form *per* row, we went with having a single form per type of table. E.g. `Courses have a 'Courses' Form` , `Whitepapers have a 'Whitepaper' form` , and so on.\n\n The idea was then to have automations work based on the form submission and page submitted on, to send the right email.\nHowever, we *can’t trigger automations based on a dynamic page* -the option doesn’t exist.\n\nWe *can* see the title of the dynamic page the form is being submitted on, in the forms own analytics.\nOn the contact record we *can also* see title of the dynamic page, together with the form.\nBut we can’t use this data, it seems.\n\nAm I missing something here?",
