    "text": "Hi there, I’ve got a scenario where I’m bundling assets from an internal package using “yarn pack” into “mypackage.tgz”. When I include the tarball in my cms asset folder and add it to my package.json file with `yarn add ./mypackage.tgz` , everything works wonderfully when run locally. But then when I deploy my project, I get an error saying that “mypackage.tgz” can’t be found. I double checked, and it’s definitely there in the upload (same directory as package.json), but it seems that the paths are slightly different when the build runs on the remote server. Could someone tell me what the path should be? I know it’s technically possible to reference this package as a private repository, but it feels like overkill to implement a workaround for something as standard and widely supported as tarball dependencies."
