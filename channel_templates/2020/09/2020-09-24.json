Couldn't find in developer docs how to do that. Thanks!",

I didn't think about applying a filter like this, and instead was hunting around for an object different from `post_summary` .\n\nFollow up question, though: That also strips any paragraph breaks which presumably was from &lt;p&gt;'s via the rich text editor. Any tips on how to preserve linebreaks with striptag? No worries if not, I can roll with it"

You could use multiple filters to and use this with `|truncatehtml` which would then let you cut it down a bit (if you wanted only a snippet of it) and would still close the HTML tags properly for you."
