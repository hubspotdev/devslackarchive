Your file likely is still there, just not in the tree.\n\nThe cause of this issue seems to be when you delete a folder in design manager 2, then moving something into the deleted folder after the fact.\n\nThis can easily happen when you’re copying modules from portal to portal.\n\nCreates a weird situation where your module/template/files are floating in outerspace.\n\n<@U9WG7DMHB> helped me previously when that happened a while back.
