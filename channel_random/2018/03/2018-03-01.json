We also have a filter in GA that filters out on our IP addresses, but a lot of remote team members don't have static IPs. \n\nBlocking HubSpot in ghostery now disables forms and other stuff. \n\nWe want* to ensure we are not skewing data in client sites. I feel that being logged into HubSpot helps with that. Do any of you have a better way to not skew google analytics data?"
