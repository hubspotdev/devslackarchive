    "text": "<@U06CV887Y1M> would you be able to share an example on your side where this breaks? I put together a small example showing an onClick event opening a modal with a CTA component inside, so I am guessing there is a misunderstanding on my side of your modules requirements.\n\nAlso a couple things that have caused confusion in the past:\n• From the dev server, you must use the \"preview\" route to view any of our cms components (Cta, Icon, RichText, etc). That is the link on the left side if you are looking at the list of modules on the dev server index page\n• We don't automatically provide a default value for Cta's, so you must add a default value on your CtaField. Something like this: \n```<CtaField name=\"cta\" label=\"Cta\" default={'<CTA_ID'} />```\nFeel free to share the code example in this thread or DM me directly, whatever you are more comfortable with :+1:",

It just render the template, but none of the react modules are rendered. In the console, i can see that there is nothing saying \"Rendering module xxx\" (screenshot A doesn't work, screenshot B works). This issue just happened probably more than a month ago. It worked normally before. Does anyone know how to fix this problem? Thanks in advance!",
