Any ideas for how I can build one website page on HubSpot CMS while leaving the rest of the pages hosted on their current server, so that when a visitor visits this one page, it loads the HubSpot page at the same domain as the rest of the site?",

Seems on some sessions pages are not being picked up, where other sessions those same pages do get picked up. I wonder if safari's anti-tracking tech update (mar20) is to blame...",

Instead, you nailed it, Safari has implemented (<https://webkit.org/blog/8613/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-1/|per this post>) a capability that limits the tracking to 7 days for first party cookies set through the document.cookie function.\n\nWhat this means is that after 7 days a returning visitor will show up as a new visitor instead of being seen as a returning visitor.\n\nYou can verify that the tracking code is actually firing on your site by the presence of network requests to `<https://track.HubSpot.com/__ptq.gif>`"
