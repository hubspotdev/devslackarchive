We would like to be able to send another property when a user starts the chat so that we can copy it in the deal that gets created with a workflow. How can I send a custom property when the user start the chat?\nI see here: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/inbox/HubSpots-conversations-properties> that it might not be possible. But maybe another way to solve my problem would be to be able to access the thread id of the conversation from the website."

I’ve been thinking about a solution for this on the front end to always add `?hsDebug=true` and for the `developerMode=true` and haven’t worked out a way to make this work and be smart enough that I don’t have a bunch of stuff to code manually and I didn’t feel like making a chrome extension — this might be that solution I need"
