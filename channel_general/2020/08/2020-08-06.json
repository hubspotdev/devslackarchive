    "text": "Good day HubSpotters :grin:\n\nCurrently working on a clients website - busy optimizing the websites performance.\nAccording to our GTmetrix report, we have noticed that the HTAccess file is dated.\nIs there a way we could make adjustments (enhancements) to this file?\n\"There are 16 static components without a far-future expiration date.\"\n\nAny feedback would be amazing.\n\nSide question if it could be answered it would be great. What is the highest score one can achieve in GTMetrix on a HubSpot website? What is a \"good\" score for a HubSpot website"
