When using the watch command you specify a `src` directory (more info here: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/local-development-cms-cli#watch>). This directory is then what is being watched when you run the watch command. In your case (based on your screenshots) if you're using the `watch` command on the `src` folder, it wouldn't pick up changes to adjacent folders like `images`, `js` , `templates`, etc. It would only pick up changes made within the `src` folder. The name of the directory doesn't matter (e.g. it can be `project-name` rather than `src`) but essentially the watch command will only watch whatever you set for the directory."

In the top level project folder there are things like readme files, github specific files, etc. that we don't want being uploaded to a portal, therefore when you run the watch command on boilerplate you just target the `src` folder within the boilerplate project folder so it only pulls in what you want (and all files needed for the boilerplate theme are within that `src` folder). Hope that helps!"

    "text": "So I might recommend a similar configuration to that boilerplate project above. In that case it would look something like:\nLP Demo project:\n• Top level files you don't want uploaded like `.github` , `bin`, `HubSpot.deploy`, `node_modules` (if you have any of these at all - not sure if you are working out of GitHub using something that would require this)\n• A folder (named `src` or whatever you prefer to call it)  where your theme files live. This is what you would use the `watch` command on.\nAs far as theme directories go you can use different subdirectories within your `src` file/main project directory. That is up to your preference. Boilerplate uses several (e.g. templates is broken out into some different folders: <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/tree/master/src/templates>). As far as boilerplate goes - yeah exactly you can use the top level stuff if you want but in reality what you need for the actual theme is `boilerplate-theme/src`. Any new theme you create doesn't _need_ a `src` folder within the main project folder but that method can be used if you have top level files/folders you don't want to include but you do want to keep grouped with your project."

I'm not 100% sure how those folders got out of the `src` folder for your project."
