    "text": "Indeed, there can't be multiple pages under the same URL exist parallel. You need a language parameter in the URL. Something like /de/... /en/..., or the URL itself is translated. Last options are subdomains, but subdomains are separate ranking containers for search engines, so better avoid that, until you want each language to rank differently. I suggest folders like /en/... and, not sure, but HubSpot should do the redirect automaticity with a wildcard entry: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/domains-and-urls/set-up-a-flexible-pattern-url-redirect>, is a 301 Permanent Redirect, search engine and SEO tools maybe use a moment, but understand that; raking will be inherited. Different thing are campaigns, Google Ads or other advertisement, they often need a direct page and will reject redirect URLs, so they have to be changed manually, otherwise failures or fallbacks take place, that should be highly avoided."
