Let's get someone to share that information in slack or a blog.  I'm advocating for a more inclusive developer day if HubSpot isn't going to run it. If you don't care to hear my opinion or the reason why, don't read below. If you are interested in my take, please read on. These are just my thoughts and not \"beliefs\" so they can be changed easily.\n\nSO.. I've sat on this for 24 hours and I've done some thinking on developer day as a whole and what I've seen in the past 6 years. This is going to be a wall of text. I apologize and will give you the TLDR up front. A non HubSpot sponsored developer day should be virtual. The time and effort it takes to set up what is wanted to do, then share it with the community that aren't there is WAY TOO HIGH. There is a lot involved with this. I appreciate everyone's effort here but we can have a much more successful developer day if we do this virtually."

    "text": "I still need to read <@U25PYL3Q8> doc, but wanted to voice my thoughts on what’s voiced in the slack before i dig into that.\n\nThe physical developer day idea is to enable a couple things - Those of us that can get our companies to ship us out there, if we’re just there to network with the marketers that’s not usually worth our ticket and travel costs. When there is a physical event that we may benefit from regarding education and whatnot. we do have a good reason to be there, and are networking with people who are arguably more valuable for us to network with long term.\n\nI think you were eluding to the fact that due to the delay in content being made available online from last years event, AND the fact that the meetup last year felt kind of like a “cool kids club”.\n\nWith the community run ideas I was thinking - we can scrap some of the things that makes it hard for HubSpot to run this kind of stuff.\n\nMost of us in the community don’t care about the recordings of the content being perfect before it goes online. We’re also happy to do things more informally. We’re a big group of web developers attending an event for web developers, if we can’t collectively make it so other web developers who couldn’t physically make it don’t feel included, and don’t get a high quality experience, I feel - what are we doing with our careers? lol If anyone can put something on the web it should be us.\n\nSo the ideas were to strip out the niceties that HubSpot Corporate would feel they need because they have to meet expectations, and really focus on what the developers want. Content from people doing cool things in the community - news from HubSpot related to what we do, and community building."
