Then I noticed the `fields.json` file was blank in the portal. I uploaded that file individually and then I uploaded the entire project with no errors. Maybe during the upload process you can change the CLI to upload the `theme.json` and the `fields.json` files first? Seems like the order is what made things break for me",
