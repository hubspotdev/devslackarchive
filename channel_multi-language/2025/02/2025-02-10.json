We have a few areas where aria labels are included in the HubL with hard-coded English values in some instances.\n\nI guess we could use the default HubL variables related to language to customize the text based on the page's language, but I can imagine that getting out of hand quickly if we start to localize to many different languages. Curious if there's a preferred method. Thanks!",
