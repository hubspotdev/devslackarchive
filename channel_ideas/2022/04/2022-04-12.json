    "text": "What is the possibility of getting the ability to set multiple controlling fields for the display conditions in the field editor? Something like `If boolean-1 == true &amp;&amp; choice-1 == \"value1\" then visibility == visible` ? Right now you can use custom regex to set multiple values but you can only have one controlling field (unless there is some hidden method that I can't figure out). Seems like setting an array of objects in the `.json` should be able to handle it but the capabilities don't seen to be there yet. The only solution I have come up with so far is to nest the field further and put one display condition on the group and the other on the field but that feels like an un-necessary work-around.",
