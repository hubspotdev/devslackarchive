I am following every bit of the steps on the video tutorials and getting a different from the actual result. It's kind of frustrating to learn the development process if the videos are outdated. I'm currently taking this course \"HubSpot CMS themes quickstart for developers\" and can't move forward due to issues like this:\n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Is-the-HubSpot-CMS-for-Developers-course-up-to-date/m-p/756917>\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Test-theme-folder-empty/m-p/820959#M35052>\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Having-error-when-upload-html-page-template-to-CMS/m-p/628089>\n\nAnyone experiencing the same issues I am having. I'm kind of new to HubSpot development and these courses is getting me more confused.",
