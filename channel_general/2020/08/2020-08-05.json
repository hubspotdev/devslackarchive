Or will image optimisation continue to apply if we move to the custom module approach? Documentation says any image with height and width attributes will be resized automatically, but I would like to confirm if this applies universally."

The idea is to get a new window with a preview of the articles for social share.\nThe problems is that it works only the second or third time we click on it.\nThe first time you click on it it opens a windows, but only the link of the post is visible, with no meta description or featured image. The second or third click, the post gets formatted correctly. It’s pretty strange.\nAny idea or suggestion will be very usefull!\nThanks",
