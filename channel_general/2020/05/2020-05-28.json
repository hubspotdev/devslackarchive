You can certainly ask a question and if an answer is a specific value or set of values you can ask more questions. I just don't think there is a way for me to \"repeat\" questions in a dynamic fashion. I could make a very ugly, longer form with sections but am trying to avoid this."

With that class you can progressively enhance your site so if javascript is disabled you can hide anything that would be broken or show an alternative. They only thing you need to make it work is simply having javascript called by the page update the class to `js` ."
