    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently going through the HubSpot CMS for Developers Practicum and trying to complete the 2nd requirement involving creating an image module and a rich text module next to one another in a template.\n\nI followed along with the instructional video and looked into some documentation and I've been stuck on this for about 2 hours.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI've attached the code in my page.html template below.\n\nRight now, I'd expect for this to output an image module and a rich text module next to one another on the page as it does in the relevant instructional video.  It does not.  Instead, what I see is in the second screenshot below.  Two areas that say \"drop modules here\" rendered one on top of the other.\n\nI watched the video on preparing for the practicum and so I know that not properly including the _layout.css from the boilerplate theme to handle the 12 column grid can mess people up.  That is all handled as far as I know.  I have it included into my main.css which is required in my base.html which my page.html template extends.\n\nPlease any help here would be appreciated.  I'm at a loss as to what could be going wrong.",
