    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI really want to start using DND areas, they give the content editors lots of flexibility, but how are people dealing with the responsive design part of it?\n\nSo say you drag in a rich text module and then an image next to it so they are side by side, that may look fine on desktop, but on mobile when they stack on top of each other you may want extra space between the text and image, is this possible?\n\nFor reference I’m using the `layout.css` file from the CMS Theme Boilerplate for the responsive grid.",
