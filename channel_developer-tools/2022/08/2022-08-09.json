Was trying to find an official procedure for migration between accounts, but wasn't sure where to look.\n\n(Ideally, step one would be to have everything migrated over to a subdomain first, like <http://alpha.company.com|alpha.company.com>, and once it all checks out to be working properly there, then move it over to production at <http://www.company.com|www.company.com>)"
