Not sure if this is the right spot to ask, but I'm working on the HubSpot Developer Practicum right now and I can't seem to figure out how to get the draggable handles in the DND section. I am able to get the DND area to show, but when I place two modules inside of it, it does not give me the option to adjust the width of each module. Would someone be able to help me out?",
