    "text": "Hey team! I've got an app that we send a form submission through the forms API whenever someone fills out a free trial in the app. This has worked, but now we're starting to get duplicate companies from other HubSpot workflows.\n\nMy thought was to use the new forms beta that allows company properties in forms so I can still make that same API call and have the form create the company.\n\n1. Is this possible? (it doesn't seem to be, or the docs are out of date)\n2. Am I just better off making a separate call to create the company and associating it with the contact getting created off the form submission?\nSOLVED! turns out you can use `objectTypeID` in the forms API"
