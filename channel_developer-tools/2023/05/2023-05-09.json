    "text": "Hi all! :wave: I'm new to HubSpot and needing to export all of the blog posts from my current site to import them to a new non-HubSpot site. However the regular export tool doesn't process the content of my blog posts. I'm able to export everything else but the content itself. That happened because the module is custom, so the data is unstructured and according to the support team - HubSpot's system doesn't have knowledge of what it considers a post_body in that module. The only solution is to use the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/cms/blog-post|Get all blog posts endpoint> and parse through all of the widgets (i.e. modules) in the response to pull the info from the custom Blog Post module. There are a ton of widgets and other parts of content in the JSON I get from that endpoint and I see no pattern at all to work with and unify.\nDoes anyone have any experience or ideas on how to approach that?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!"
