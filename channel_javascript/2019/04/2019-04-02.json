    "text": "<@UFBNA9K9A> Thanks for the reply. I'm still confused though. Using those jQuery functions doesn't change the fact that `getElementsByName(\"hs_context\")[0]` is always undefined. For example if I try to use .val() as suggested on `$(document.getElementsByName(\"hs_context\")[0]).val()` it still results in an undefined error. Sorry, I'm unfamiliar with react, how can I access the DOM element for hs_context?"

Instead I have to do\n```var iframe = document.getElementById(\"hs-form-iframe-0\");\nvar context = iframe.contentWindow.document.getElementsByName(\"hs_context\")[0].value;```\n\nThanks for looking into it though"
