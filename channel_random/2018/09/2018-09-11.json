    "text": "just an idea I’ve been floating around in my head a long time… who would be interested in basically an open source repo for a modern version of the HubSpot Boilerplate.\n\nThe general purpose - provide a framework for building sites on HubSpot(that would work with both coded and drag and drop templates).  This framework would not lock you into using build tools, only things that HubSpot natively supports(like HubL vars and macros).\n\nIt would provide layout classes that work with the HubSpot injected classes. It would also try to only add enough styles to things to make it faster/easier to do common things, but not be opinionated.\n\nThe ultimate goal - Custom modules would be released to the marketplace built with this framework in mind, improving the interoperability of modules between sites. Also obviously improved performance and build out speed are the other main objectives.\n\nanyone got any thoughts?"
