    "text": "I’ve got a few custom or customized modules that don’t seem to render the css in the actual editor.  On the published page everything renders properly but in the editor things are not quite right.  Anyone run into this and know how to remedy it?  Most css is either in the module itself or the child.css. For example in this screen shot the text should be full width and the module shouldn’t be showing up as 1900px tall in the editor.",
