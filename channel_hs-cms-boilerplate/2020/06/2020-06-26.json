    "text": "Happy Friday everyone! A new release (v1.3) of boilerplate has been pushed out (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/releases/tag/v1.3.0>). It resolves a handful of bug issues that were in the repository and focused on improving out of the box performance and SEO scores. The demo website (<https://boilerplate.HubSpotcms.com>) which automatically pulls updates from the boilerplate repository, now has a website grader score of 100 (97 while CSS combining re-runs), a Google Lighthouse performance score of 97, a Google Lighthouse SEO score of 100, and a Google Lighthouse best practices score of 100. If you see any other ways we could improve the out of the box performance of boilerplate, please let us know either in this thread or by creating an issue/making a pull request."
