    "text": "Hai all,  am completely new to Node &amp; HubSpot Server less functions - initially I made some functions by GET,POST requests using HubSpot API endpoints like\n```<https://api.hubapi.com/contacts/v1/contact/?hapikey=demo>```\nBut later I found out about HubSpot Client API - which is much more handy on almost all operations of HubSpot\n<https://HubSpotwebteam.github.io/hs-node-api/index.html>\nHere initial command was to run\n```npm install --save HubSpot-api```\nam using vs code and connected to my HubSpot account through hs/cli . I just run this command on vs code terminal(inside theme folder) and nothing particularly happened for files/folders in local or HS account . then I tried to code as the tutorial said.\n<https://HubSpotwebteam.github.io/hs-node-api/index.html>\n```const HubSpotClient = require('HubSpot-api');\nconst hs = new HubSpotClient({ hapikey });```\nBut the fist line itself creating an error.. am sure am doing something fundamentally wrong - help me on this.. Thanks..\n\n_Error: Cannot find module 'HubSpot-api'_\n\nhow can i include this library to my HubSpot theme/account successfully??",
