I’ve got the site files on my machine via the developer tools and it’s not in any source code. I’ve checked the footer scripts and it’s not in there (it actually appears on the line after the footer scripts in the source code), and I’ve turned off Google tag manager and it isn’t that! I was just wondering if anyone knew a place I’ve neglected to check"

It’s a multi-page process where various items are selected, then data is processed at the end after submitting a simple form. That all works. But I’m trying to take these selection values and add them to the form in hidden fields so the submission record shows everything that the user selected prior to submitting the form.\n\nI have a function that puts the session values into variables prior to running some calculations. Like this:\n`var package = sessionStorage.getItem(\"package\");`\n\nI want to add code to this function where this variable is sent as the value of a hidden form field. From some Googling, I tried this:\n\n`hbspt.forms.create({`\n   `portalId: \"xxxx\",`\n   `formId: \"84dc8257-150c-4710-944d-587205ccd398\",`\n   `onFormSubmit: function($form){`\n      `$(\"input[name='msp_package']\").val(package).change();`\n   `}`\n  `});`\n\nNo matter what I try with this, nothing gets added to the form submission. I’ve got a missing piece somewhere."
