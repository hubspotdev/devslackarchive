In this case, we must adopt your layout.css which contains wrappers that cannot be turned off. This requires developers to either over-write styles and then have to thoroughly test and tweak them for every combination of browser/device (very time consuming) or work around the limitations.  If you really want the UI to be framework agnostic, users should be able to choose to hook up the latest Bootstrap, UIKit, Foundation, Semantic,  etc. so they can focus on building exceptional user interfaces instead of reinventing the wheel.  I guess that is my larger question - could I hook in something like UIKit for use in developing modules that plug into the drag/drop interface or will that not play nicely?"
