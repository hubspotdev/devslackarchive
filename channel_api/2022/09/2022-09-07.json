    "text": "Hi all, as it's not possible to add metadata to pipeline stages via HubSpot's portal, I'm trying this via the API. So far I cannot update any stages successfully. Does anyone know if I'm doing something wrong of if this is a bug on HubSpot's end? Look at the following curl calls I make and included responses:\n\n*Update a pipeline stage:*\n```curl --request PATCH \\\n  --url <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/pipelines/deal/{pipilineId}/stages/{stageId}>\\\n  --header 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \\\n  --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"deliveryState\": \"planning\"\n  }\n}'\n\n{\"label\":\"Start planning\",\"displayOrder\":0,\"metadata\":{\"isClosed\":\"true\",\"probability\":\"1.0\",\"deliveryState\":\"planning\"},\"id\":\"{stageId}\",\"createdAt\":\"2022-08-31T10:49:35.163Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2022-09-07T07:59:57.969Z\",\"archived\":false,\"writePermissions\":\"CRM_PERMISSIONS_ENFORCEMENT\"}```\nIt shows the metadata is added in the response. But when I retrieve the stage again the deliveryState metadata has dissapeared...\n\n*Return a pipeline stage by ID:*\n```curl --request GET \\\n  --url <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/pipelines/deal/{pipelineId}/stages/{stageid}>\\\n  --header 'authorization: Bearer {token}'\n\n{\n  \"label\": \"Start planning\",\n  \"displayOrder\": 0,\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"isClosed\": \"true\",\n    \"probability\": \"1.0\"\n  },\n  \"id\": \"{stageId}\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2022-08-31T10:49:35.163Z\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"2022-09-07T08:12:28.474Z\",\n  \"archived\": false,\n  \"writePermissions\": \"CRM_PERMISSIONS_ENFORCEMENT\"\n}```\n"
