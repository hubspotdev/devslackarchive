I'd like to use this property within an email using a personalisation token.\n\nIf I drop the token into an email, the resulting value is below:\n\nToday's date 02/02/2023\nDeparture date 23/03/2023\n\nTime until departure: 4,233,600,000.\n\nI'm assuming this is unix, but without a clear date I can't think of how to use a formula to format it into something like days/months/etc - Giving me something like \"X days until departure date\".\n\nAny ideas?",
