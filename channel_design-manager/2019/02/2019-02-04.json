How can I add the CSS class to style this to a button in the head html of the email?Not sure how to target it and ad some basic style\n\n\"&lt;a href=\"{{post.url}}\"&gt;&lt;button type=\"button\"&gt;Continue Here&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\" works its now just to style it and not sure how to add the CSS to do this.\n\n<https://ibb.co/MD0bcKp>"

    "text": "<@UFYKWK0R4> I think you’re going to want to get a developer to help you. your readmore is put in as a form button. That’s not going to do anything in most email clients. What you need is a link styled to look like a button. You do that by adding css to the head of the email OR you could use a CTA which would be inserted as an image.\n\nYour html that you pasted also has some odd spacing inside of the html tags. I’ve never seen someone do that, I have a feeling outlook would likely choke on that, I can’t say for certain without testing, just from experience that looks problematic.",
