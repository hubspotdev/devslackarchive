We’re still working out the details internally about how the marketplace, coded files, and DnD HubL all fit together, but we are planning on making an official announcement about this before the end of the year so stay tuned! There are a lot of exciting updates still to come, but in the meantime, I would highly recommend trying out the new DnD HubL and sending along any feedback."
