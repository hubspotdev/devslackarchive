    "text": "Hello guys, I am wondering, is it possible to get ads interaction (like shown in contacts timeline) by contact ?\n\nI am trying as custom event but there is nothing coming from the legacy version of it. I am not sure how to get that via V3 of API.\nI can get event of type - form submissions, changes to list membership and e_visited_page, but no events_ads_clicked. Where does the API allow access to this information ?\n(I see that we can get this type of event with Snowflake query but in case of no Snowflake integration, how to get events_ad_clicked or ads interaction as event? Website Analytics events api doesnt seem to give this type of event as response (even with Enterprise accounts)\nThank you!"

    "text": "Hi guys, I've integrated a third-party calling solution with HubSpot using the `Calling Extensions SDK`. Integration works fine and the users are can make outbound calls to contacts. Now we have the requirement of embedding the HubSpot in our CMS. When we embed the HubSpot in Iframe outbound calling stops working. We can see our calling widget has sent the `initialized` event to HubSpot on page load. When the user clicks on the dial call button from the contact details page, we do not receive the message from HubSpot in `onDialNumbe` function.\n[2:34 PM] I've also noticed the following error message in  browser logs when HubSpot is embedded in an iframe `[Report Only] Refused to frame '&lt;URL&gt;' because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"frame-ancestors 'self' <http://app.HubSpot.com|app.HubSpot.com>.` (edited)\n[2:35 PM] might be this error is causing the problem"
