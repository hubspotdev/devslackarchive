    "text": "Hey <@UMZFZHVUJ>,\nthe grinch gets all the cookies today :smile:\n\nIn all seriousness:\n• If it's the HubSpot cookie banner and it's apperently \"not working\", you can test it with this code:\n```// replace '.cookie-banner-button' with the class of your cookie button class \ndocument.querySelectorAll('.cookie-banner-button').forEach(button =&gt; {\n    button.addEventListener('click', function() {\n      (function(){\n        var _hsp = window._hsp = window._hsp || [];\n        _hsp.push(['showBanner']);\n        })()\n    });\n  });```\n• if they're using some other implementation like OneTrust - they have to check the settings there. Here's a list of all available <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/privacy-and-consent/what-cookies-does-HubSpot-set-in-a-visitor-s-browser|HS cookies>\n• If they have something like \"GTM triggering the cookie banner\", this might be related to this aswell(and I advise every client against this) . In this case the user has to enable Marketing cookies since GTM will fall under the Marketing cookie category. In other words: If the user won't enable marketing cookies, the cookie banner won't appear since it will be triggered by GTM - which will be blocked since the marketing cookies are not accepted.... "
