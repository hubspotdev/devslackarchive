We've also updated our contributing guide (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>), our readme (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/master/README.md>), our labels (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/labels>), and added new issue templates (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE>) and pull request templates (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md>). If you have any feedback on these community based files (especially the Wiki) please add an issue to the repository including the label of documentation (you can see we already have some ideas for the near future: <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation>). Please note that the boilerplate Wiki will serve as a source of documentation specifically for the boilerplate project and CMS documentation will still live here (<https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs>).
