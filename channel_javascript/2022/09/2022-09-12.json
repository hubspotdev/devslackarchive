    "text": "We have a few clients who have content hosted on the HubSpot CMS (either their full website and/or landing pages) - these clients also are using OneTrust as a CMP to manage their visitors data-collection preferences (HubSpot's cookie banner doesn't check all the boxes for them).\n\nMajor issue I am seeing is that HubSpot doesn't offer a way to conditionally execute the tracking code that is added into the templates automatically - this makes OneTrust implementation tricky, and quite frankly it seems like a massive oversight by HubSpot to not allow for disabling the tracking scripts outside of their own cookie consent banners.\n\n*What is the solution for this? The solution cannot be \"use the HubSpot cookie banner\" - as it isn't a full featured CMP.*",
