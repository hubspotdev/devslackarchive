    "text": "When defining default margins and padding values for `{% dnd_section %}`, is there a means of implementing media queries, or something similar? Perhaps we want a larger margin and padding on desktop vs mobile. When I inspect the page, it seems these values are injected from outside any css file (I assume through javascript), and flagged as `!important`. Any suggestions as to how I might make it a little more dynamic?",
