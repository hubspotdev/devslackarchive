    "text": "Hey <@U03BU20ACR3>, is this review for a Solutions Provider, App, or Theme?\n\nIf you're simply looking to take down a review your client left, ask them to report the review using the report button (should be at the bottom left of a particular review). If the person who left the review reports it, we can take it down, and the client can then leave a new review (if that's whats desired).\n\nIf this has already been done, feel free to DM me with some additional info (The listing, the review, and the issue), and I can get it to the right team.\n\nFrom there, if this is for an app or asset, feel free to email in to <mailto:marketplace@HubSpot.com|marketplace@HubSpot.com>"
