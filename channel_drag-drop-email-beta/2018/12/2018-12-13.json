    "text": "Not at the moment, Jon :slightly_smiling_face: The current responsive behaviour for drag-and-drop emails is a light weight adaptation of what we've seen across the net, and references to many bug fixes made over the years in the older email templates. It's not set in stone, right now the templating for drag and drop emails is locked down so much to enable us to make tweaks to these underlying frameworks as we merge things back together. We're working with Katie Tade and her team to bring our underlying editor tech and templating tech together so that the pages and email drag and drop experiences are the same in the future."
