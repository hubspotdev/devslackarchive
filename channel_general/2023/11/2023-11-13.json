And I am not sure that can be fixed because it is something that Safari is not very supportive of. But the video should play. Here is the code block of the module where the video file would be placed:\n```{% if module.video.videourl.url.type == 'FILE' %}\n\t&lt;video &gt;\n\t\t{% set names = module.video.videourl.url.href|split('webm', 2) %}\n\t\t{% for name in names %}\n\t\t    {% if loop.index ==1 %} \n\t\t\t\t&lt;source src=\"{{name}}mov\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"hvc1\"'&gt;\n\t\t\t{% endif %}\n\t\t{% endfor %}\n\t\t\t\t&lt;source src=\"{{module.video.videourl.url.href}}\" type=\"video/webm\"&gt;\n\t&lt;/video&gt;  \n{% endif %}```\nAnd it is important to upload the two videos into the file manager with the exact same name with the only difference between the two being the extension (.webm and .mp4)\n\nHope this makes sense"

For example, you’ll see lots of use of the term “guys” on here which is technically also gendered and not ideal, but not as strictly enforced given its wider acceptance acceptance across all genders. Enough language lessons here, just really appreciate your response and would be happy to delete my feedback if you edit your original post. "
