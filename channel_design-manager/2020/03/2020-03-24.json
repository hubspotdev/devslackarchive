    "text": "Not sure this is the best place to ask this but has anyone ever found a way to integrate custom HTML into a HubSpot CTA? We normally use image CTAs but these never have hover effects, I've looked at HubSpot CTA Buttons but I like the ability to have link blocking so the whole CTA target is clickable. I would love it if I could create an HTML panel and have it inject into a page via the CTA tool so it would act as a CTA and be trackable etc. Any ideas if this is possible?",
