If you haven’t developed emails before, that’s where you’ll want to start.\n\nFor HubSpot specifically, I would start with <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/templates/email-template-markup>\n\nBasically you could start with building an email template, with everything hard-coded (copy, etc.) and just simply add in the variables that are required for email. And then from there you can add in custom modules etc.\n\nAlso to note that not all of HubSpot’s functions, filters. etc work in email templates. Usually the documentation mentions this but good to be aware."

There are some ways to try to make a custom email template be more flexible, but not drag and drop.\n\nIf there’s a requirement for true drag-and-drop capability, then you just use the drag-and-drop editor and save a template there."
