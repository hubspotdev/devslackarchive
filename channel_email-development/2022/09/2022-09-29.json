    "text": "Hi all, please let me know if I'm in the wrong channel. I was directed here by a support agent.  I would like to add the ability for attachments directly in the quote template. For this, I need to create a custom quote template in the design manager, which will offer a higher-level editing interface allowing me to use an HTML to <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules|customize modules> and other elements of the quote template. I need help from someone who has coding/developers knowledge to do this, because by default you can not add an attachment to a quote. Thanks in advance!"
