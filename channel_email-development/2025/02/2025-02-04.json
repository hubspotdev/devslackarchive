However, the client and my fellow employee both received emails that were missing  2 small column sections.  Those sections had a background image, which I know can be blocked, especially by Outlook.  I'm wondering why I was able to receive them as designed but the others did not.  Are there any quick insights into what happened? Thanks!",
