    "text": "We've been working on a site for a customer and now started to look at the loading times. Seems that every fourth or fifth page load gives quite poor results. I tried with a template with basically nothing in it and Chrome dev tools (cache not disabled) shows page load times of over one second.\n\nThis is template:\n```<html>\n<head>\n{{ standard_header_includes }}\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Test</h1>\n{{ standard_footer_includes }}\n</body>\n</html>```\nie. as you can see there is no room for optimisation on our behalf. Attached is the dev tools timing for the endpoint.  When refreshing the page there is usually 3-4 loads with roughly 200ms response time (testing from Finland), and then one over one second.\n\n<@U7SL518D6> any insights why this happens?\n\ncurl request with <https://discuss.devopscube.com/t/how-to-find-response-time-using-curl-request/436|this formatting file> shows:\n```{\n\"time_redirect\": 0.000000,\n\"time_namelookup\": 0.006558,\n\"time_connect\": 0.022656,\n\"time_appconnect\": 0.067331,\n\"time_pretransfer\": 0.067460,\n\"time_starttransfer\": 1.254416,\n\"time_total\": 1.255587,\n\"size_request\": 88,\n\"size_upload\": 0,\n\"size_download\": 3473,\n\"size_header\": 1227\n}```",
