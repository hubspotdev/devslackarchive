We have a css file setup for our sections and containers within them to have defined margins, padding, widths, etc. so there is consistency throughout the UI.\n\nThe documentation states that you can assign a class to sections. Does this not apply to DND Sections? I have:\n{% dnd_section class='q-section %}\nbut the output does not render the output. I just see:\n&lt;div class=\"row-fluid-wrapper row-depth-1 row-number-1 dnd-section\"&gt;\n\nIs it not possible to add classes to dnd_sections?",

I agree with the ability to allow a UI designer the ability to modify it based on the design, but having set layouts defined helps establish consistent design patterns.\n\nI originally had 3 classes for my sections so they could be full-width, standard, or small (for things like FAQ sections.   It doesn't look like I am going to be able to apply this as I hoped.\n\nIn my mind, it would be easier if there was a cleaner layout rendered:\nSection: define the background\nContainer: sets the width, padding and margins, creates the grid, etc.\nModule: your rich text, image, gallery, etc. no styling\n\nThe excessive nesting just makes this more complicated than it needs to be."
