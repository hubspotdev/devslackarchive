I'm building a little set of pages with Auth0 (<https://auth0.com/>) and after the user logs in I'd like to make sure their contact in HubSpot matches the Auth0 login so I can pull contact properties from HubSpot. I tried putting in a little hidden form and submitting that, but it doesn't really seem to set the contact."

So, I can print what HubSpot thinks the contact is to the page, compare that against the login email, and if they don't match redirect to the current page with that as the query. Then when that loads, the contact is correct, and I can just remove that from the URL. This has the downside of causing the page to refresh whenever they navigate to a new one if the contact isn't set without the query, but I guess that's fine"
