    "text": "There's a separate `hubdb_table` function which will get you metadata about the table (including columns).\nIf you're using a HubDB row field, you don't need to query with `hubdb_table_rows` - the module will provide the results in the `module.product_comparison_header` variable. I would recommend using the `|tojson` filter on this variable to get a better idea of how it's structured. Basically, the purpose of this field is to allow the author to select a specific row from a  specific table.\nIf you instead want to allow the author to pick a table and then query it with `hubdb_table_rows`, you should instead use the HubDB _table_ field type."
