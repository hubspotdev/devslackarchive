This all goes well except that the container containing the video has an unusual aspect ratio meaning that my video (16:9) is being cropped. This is fine as i need it to cover the container and is just there to set the mood. but it also crops the controls off the video. Is it possible to move the controls up to be visible in the container but keep the video cropped?"

    "text": "Hello there,\nThis is Santhoshkumar, a web developer\n\nI'm using a HubSpot form for all kinda forms on my website, especially signup. I'm using this HubSpot form for form submission followed by the Revenue Hero meeting scheduler. I could see that the HubSpot form accepts numbers and special characters in the name fields such as first and last names. So, there is a possibility of injecting the anonymous code into the field which is against our security policy.  So, I need to restrict those by setting the rules. I have explored some community forums for <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Custom-validation-or-prevent-form-submission/m-p/666857|Custom validation or prevent form submission> - which recommends adding custom validations on the form fields by preventing the default behavior of the form submission. This actually works as expected on form validation but after the form submission, the Revenue Hero meeting scheduler is not showing up.\n\nI have also explored some documentation that says that the rules can be set up only while creating a property that is even for custom property, not for default property. I can't able to set rules for the default names field property.\n\nI want to restrict the numbers and special characters in the name fields. So, could you please assist me with this?\n\nThanks in advance,\nSanthoshkumar R",
