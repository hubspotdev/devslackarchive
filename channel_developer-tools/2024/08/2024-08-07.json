    "text": "Hello Team;\nI'm working on to build an App for HubSpot market place. This app will be used to sync users(on register) from my platform to HubSpot as contact and vice versa. My tech stack is laravel.\n\n*Our Scenario*\nMy platform is for event management, in which each event will have unique access key with a dedicated subdomain and registration form for users which are always custom except three fields i.e Fname,Lname and Email. Rest there can be 50 custom fields on the form depending on user requirement.\n\nWe want when user registers on an event he can be synced into HubSpot as contact and vice versa and we are making a global solution so any agency that is using HubSpot can use this by installing our app from the HubSpot market place. At the moment we are using Zapier and some other tools to achieve this where user uses his dedicated API key and accesses fields from his unique custom form.\n\nQ.1\n We want to authenticate our event on HubSpot as each event will have a unique API key, first user should be able to map his event(access his event).\n\nQ.2\nHow would the contact that is created on HubSpot will be received by us i.e using what webhook or polling.\n\nQ.3\nField mapping does that will be provided by HubSpot or do we need to mange that in our app for all fields including custom.\n\nQ.4\nhow would we send data, is there a webhook endpoint where we would push data or we need to create a polling API like we did for Zapier."
