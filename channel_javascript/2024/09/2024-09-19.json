Here is the message :\n\nHeard back from the team and as far as we could see, our forms v2 script was last modified on Tue, 03 Sep 2024 14:36:36 UTC which might possibly have led to this conflict\n• But to set some expectations, We do reserve the right to make changes to those scripts as needed and it's not a possibility that we update customers on every change that is made\n"
