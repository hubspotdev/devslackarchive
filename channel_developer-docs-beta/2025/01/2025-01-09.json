    "text": "Hi <@U037ZPYEGAF>! I was able to confirm with the team that the <http://archive.org|archive.org> page shows a version from 2017, and the endpoint was marked as deprecated in early 2020 when the new CRM association API was released, which is why it's not documented. While the v1 endpoint may still work, it's no longer supported, so the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/api/crm/associations/associations-v4|v4 Associations API> should be used instead.\n\nIf you have any feedback regarding the API itself, I'd recommend submitting the new <https://developers.HubSpot.com/feedback|Developer Feedback Form here>, as this will route the feedback to the owning team :slightly_smiling_face:"
