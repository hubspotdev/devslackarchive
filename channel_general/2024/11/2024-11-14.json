In your portal, click on parameters -> Domains and url -> URL redirects, and you create a new redirect (permanent) from <http://example.com/about|example.com/about> (your HubSpot website) to <http://example2.com/about|example2.com/about> (<http://example2.com|example2.com> is your wordpress website). You can also create two subdomains for your <http://example.com|example.com> domain: <http://wordpress.example.com|wordpress.example.com> and <http://HubSpot.example.com|HubSpot.example.com>, and put the HubSpot tracking code on your wordpress site: you will be able to navigate between the two websites and keeping HubSpot tools on the wordpress website. Your page \"about\" will be on <http://wordpress.example.com|wordpress.example.com> and the HubSpot pages on <http://HubSpot.example.com|HubSpot.example.com>. But you cannot have your HubSpot website on <http://example.com|example.com> *and* the wordpress one in the same domain *without a subdomain separation*."
