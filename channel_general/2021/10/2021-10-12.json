Instead of sharing the payment link manually again, Sellers can automate the task to share the pricing link with HubSpot Workflows + HubSpot Payment and receive the payments in HubSpot.\nThis automation could get easily implemented as per the buyer's real-time response.\n\n*`I wonder if HubSpot provides a way to track the Abandoned payments (If a customer clicked on the payment link but didn't complete the payment). Based on the same scenario, sellers can automate the mails via HubSpot workflow to target &amp; retain the customer.`*\n\n<https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#|HubSpot> payments + Workflows"
