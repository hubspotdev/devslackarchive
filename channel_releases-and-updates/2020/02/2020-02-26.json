    "text": "Hello devs! \n\nThe CMS CLI, local development tooling, is out of beta as of version 1.0.9! In this version, we have introduced a new form of authentication, the personal CMS access key, that is both incredibly easy to set up and secure. Its access is limited to tools the CMS CLI touches, it is tied to your user (so changes are attributed to your user) on a per portal basis and all you have to do is copy it (like an API key). \n\nUpdate your version of the CMS CLI by running `npm install -g @HubSpot/cms-cli@latest` to start using personal access keys!\n\nIf you want to update your config file to use a personal access key for an existing account, or create a new entry for an account using a personal access key, run `hs auth personalaccesskey` <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tools/local-development-reference#auth>\n\nIf you have not yet checked out the local development tools, please join <#CLJJXGTC0|local-development> and check out <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tools/local-development> to get started."
