    "text": "We're developing an MVP app and are thinking about applying. The thing that confuses me is this: \"*Only*Â App Partners and developers who want to create custom objects for multiple accounts should apply to join the pilot program.\"\n\nI'm confused because the field \"custom object index page link\" is a mandatory field. Does this mean that you should only apply if you're building an app aimed towards Enterprise accounts?"
