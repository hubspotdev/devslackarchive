    "text": "Hi, we’re looking to add a an attribute to the HubSpot Tracking script, in order to make it compliant with a cookie tracking script - Specifically we need to set a `data-cookieconsent=\"xx\"`  on the `&lt;script&gt;` tag. However it doesn’t seem possible to edit or change the HubSpot Tracking script when the website in question is hosted on HubSpot CMS.\nDo any of you know whether or not it’s possible to alter the script on a HubSpot CMS website, if not directly then through JS or API. I’ve not been able to find any further information on this specifically.",
