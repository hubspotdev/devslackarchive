    "text": "Hi folks, I'm Julie from GiveDirectly. We're trying to get our transactional single send api emails set up in python but having some trouble with error handling. The response for the *`/marketing/v3/transactional/single-email/send`* endpoint is <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/marketing/transactional-emails|documented> to contain a `sendResult` key, but I get a key error when I try to access it on the `response.json()` I get from posting to that endpoint. Anyone have thoughts on why it's missing? Looks like I'm just getting the keys `statusId`, `status`  and `requestedAt` but many more keys are documented.",
