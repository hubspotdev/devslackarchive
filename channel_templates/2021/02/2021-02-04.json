I have created an HTML + HubL template and put the templateType as blog_post at the top, which does allow me to select this as the template for my blog posts in settings. However, when I go to actually make a blog post, I can’t edit the content anywhere. I can edit the title just fine, and it shows up in the template correctly. But there doesn’t seem to be any way to edit the blog post body itself. Am I missing something in my template to allow this?",
