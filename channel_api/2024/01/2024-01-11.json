    "text": "Hi all. <@U04JUUACH6E> and I have been geeking out this past week, building a black-box rate limiter for all our serverless public HubSpot apps, to limit each App/portal ID to max 100 calls per 10 secs.\nServerless apps in state machines are like workflows, event driven, spawn and scale big, scale back to zero in an instant and are loosely coupled (no shared mem/tables).\nSo we think we have hit on a solution that looks to be working well. It taps into how we shaped traffic in my Cisco days, where multiple LAN devices fight for a share of limited bandwidth WAN links, yet ensuring critical traffic like voice packets get priority and no head-of-line blocking delays.\nWe are now looking at potentially load-balancing over multiple access-tokens for situations where an app must have a higher rate limit to function with tight response times or execution window - like bonded WAN links for bigger pipes.\nIt’s amazing how similar this is to engineering networks for scale.\nBut we can’t be the only ones having to engineer this architecture for deterministic scale.\nAre others on this path too, so we can collab?",

    "text": "Hi <@U25PYL3Q8> - weighing in here again with <@U04JUUACH6E> as we “must” solve a problem of disappearing objects to be able to release a feature of our DoQuotes app. Ours might not be the same error. It is specific to the Tax, Fee or Discount objects that are created and associated to a Quote. The objects are always created (it’s not a 429 rate-limit problem and it’s not that the quotebuilder UI is saving over them). Only “some” say 20%, completely disappear immediately afterward. It’s not just the association that is gone, but the objects are too.\nAs I say, it might not be the same problem your client is claiming, as these are not custom objects, they are just tax objects associated with quotes.\nWe are looking to escalate this with HubSpot so we can release this as a reliable feature that customers want. Does your customer want you to solve isolate and solve theirs too?"

We thought maybe the objects were missing because we created a tax object and then later associated it to quotes. When we saw them deleting without a trace, we abandoned the create object and re-use it every time, and opted for creating and associating a new tax object to the quote every time. But still, some of them (maybe 20%) disappear just after being successfully created. Gone without a trace.\nWe have to chase this down for our app to have the reliable feature of adding taxes, fees and discounts to the quote summary.\nDo you plan to chase this same issue down too? We can show proof and escalate to HubSpot together."

Can you verify that they exists in an archived state?\nHow are the objects created? Via api or manually in the UI?\nIs this a private app or public app?\n\nIf this is happening with 20% of these objects, are you able to do something like this?\nTake your current codebase, make some sort of if statement in there when these associated objects are created and run a loop through this. I’ll give an example of what I might do in your situation\n\nIf statement looks for an original object with a specific id or name that you are able to create. I’ll use an example of this quote called “nick’s quote” — so when nick’s quote comes up and needs the tax objects created and associated, at that point you want to create 100 objects and associate them to that original nick’s quote object. Name them in order, 1 tax, 2 tax, 3 tax, etc.. that way you can sort by the name.\n\nMake sure you aren’t allowing rate limit errors to happen, back off or however you are solving for that.\n\nAnd then I would absolutely log all of the create/associate payloads and their response, then review. If you are missing 20% of these you should have some gaps.\n\nDo you think something like that would work? I believe this would allow you to show support that there is an actual issue, having those logs and the objects missing should prove your case"
