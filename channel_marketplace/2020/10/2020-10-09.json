    "text": "Hi Everyone! I had a question about themes and the marketplace. Typically, I build / create on my local machine and then push changes up to HubSpot. There have been times, that I just wipe the entire theme folder out and upload a fresh copy. How does this work with having a theme on the Marketplace and wanting to push updates / versions to that theme? Do I need to leave the folder there and just push updates into the folder to be able to edit the main product listing, or what is the best practice for wanting to push updates to your theme in the marketplace?",
