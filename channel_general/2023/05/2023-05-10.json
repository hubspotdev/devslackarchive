    "text": "Hello, a few months ago I asked here about custom posttype, like in wordpress. some people recommended Hubdb and other blog types. But Is it possible to fill the Hubdb with a editor of some sort? I want to have a projects type. But filling each project from the hubdb is really ugly and doesn't work well because it has alot of fields. Is there any way to do this? to fill the hubdb just like a blog?\n\nOur is the best way to use blog listings? But then I got to the problem of how I could only show specific listings?"

    "text": "Hey there ! I try to use an endpoint with node inside a workflow with custom code: *POST`/crm/v3/objects/{objectType}`*\nYou can find the doc about it here: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/crm-custom-objects#tab-2>\n\nMy problem is that I achieve to create my object but not the association, in the doc it says that:\n`const SimplePublicObjectInputForCreate = { properties, associations: [{\"to\":{\"id\":\"string\"},\"types\":[{\"associationCategory\":\"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\"associationTypeId\":0}]}] };`\nI have a problem with what I have to fill with the values of associations.. Does somebody can explain me ?\nUsually, first I create the object, then I get the object Id that I just created and then I associate my objects... But I want to optimize my script (due to 20 secs limitations) and so I wanted to do it in one step. With this method I just need the objectId and objectTypeId of my 2 objects, but with the \"one step method\" I don't know what do I need.."
