So it would be good to post up somewhere when an announcement is made and allocate it out to various teams to read and sign off as ok/action if needed.\n\nCommunity post tags like `Breaking Changes`, `Announcement`, `API` from this post would be very helpful - <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Developer-Announcements/Increasing-the-size-of-contact-record-IDs/td-p/890611>",
