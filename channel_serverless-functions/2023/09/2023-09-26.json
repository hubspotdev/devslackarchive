    "text": "Hi,\nWe recently updated a serverless function by adding some additional `console.log` functions as well as updating the verbiage from existing ones. When we publish, it appears that the logs are not changing. Is there some cache or build command that needs to be ran in order for serverless function updates to take effect? Thanks!",
