    "text": "Hi everybody,\n\nI need help for a form submission via API.\n\nI need to POST a form with file fields, one single file and one multiple. From what I found on the internet, it's not possible to push files as file content, I have to upload it first, get the link and send the link to the form.\n\nI upload the files into HubSpot with a POST on `<https://api.hubapi.com/files/v3/files>`  into a specific folder, with private access (because it's sensitive data for us) and get the links\n\nAnd then I send a form with a POST on `<https://api.hsforms.com/submissions/v3/integration/submit/${portalId}/${formGuid}>``  with this body :\n\n`{`\n    `\"fields\": [`\n        `{`\n            `\"objectTypeId\": \"0-1\",`\n            `\"name\": \"TICKET.company_id__clone_\",`\n            `\"value\": \"24459\"`\n        `},`\n        `{`\n            `\"objectTypeId\": \"0-1\",`\n            `\"name\": \"email\",`\n            `\"value\": \"<mailto:jbordas@evoliz.com|jbordas@evoliz.com>\"`\n        `},`\n        `{`\n            `\"objectTypeId\": \"0-1\",`\n            `\"name\": \"TICKET.votre_kbis__clone_\",`\n            `\"value\": \"<https://c8.alamy.com/compfr/2rgd3nh/aeronautica-militaire-italiano-aermacchi-mb339a-mm55055-61-20-msn-6851-189-aa086-de-61-stormo-aeronautica-militaire-italiano-italian-air-force-plus-tard-converti-en-mb339pan-pour-frecce-tricolori-2rgd3nh.jpg>\"`\n        `},`\n        `{`\n            `\"objectTypeId\": \"0-1\",`\n            `\"name\": \"TICKET.votre_piece_d_identite__clone_\",`\n            `\"value\": \"<https://api-eu1.HubSpot.com/filemanager/api/v2/files/204400782571/signed-url-redirect?portalId=139808082>\"`\n        `}`\n    `]`\n`}`\n\nThe first file is a random google image link, and the second one is a file url from HubSpot with private access (I can open the file in the browser if I'm logged in\"\n\nInto the form submission view in the HubSpot interface, the random google image link works and I can see the image, but for the HubSpot file it download an HTML file, which actually is the HubSpot login page. I'm sure it's because the file as a private access.. (CF screenshots)\n\nSo here are my questions :\n\n• Do I really need to upload files before and send link to submit a form or a I can send a file content?\n• Is it possible to juste display the links as string (notclickable) in the form submission interface to copy paste it because the link isn't working for private access HubSpot files)\n• Is there a specific way to handle HubSpot private files?\nThanks by advance, do no hesitate to contact me for more informations, kinda hard to explain the flow by typing :sweat_smile:",
