    "text": "Yeah I think it might be a little challenging in that regard but I do think we would like to get a base Figma file together for boilerplate (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/issues/139>). I think in that Figma file we could set what the max width of the grid would be at certain screen widths (e.g. we have a max-width on the content at `1240` for boilerplate) so we could reasonably get a px value for gaps + column widths based on that.\n\nThat definitely isn't as flexible as I'd like but hopefully better than nothing until a time where % is an option.\n\nAlso just FYI I have a branch up that fixes the issue but ran into another problem of support of `gap` within `flexbox` for some Safari users (~0.56%). Trying to look into a workaround for those users but feel free to pull down the branch if you are looking for a quick fix of what is currently there and are not super concerned with that particular segment."
