    "text": "Hi everyone! I am a developer and recently starting to use HubSpot. Right now we use HubSpot to create emails for our users. I know that to translate the emails we can use the integration with crowdin. But this integration creates a different file for each language, and that's not convenient for our marketers that need to send the emails.  I have been asked to investigate if it's possible to connect crowdin with HubSpot through some code in the template, that would allow us to have just one template that, depending on the language version of the user, show one language or the other. I worked on another CRM platform and we could solve this issue by adding some code to the template (they also had the integration with crowdin, but with the same issue), so I was wondering it it would be possible to do the same in HubSpot. Thanks"
