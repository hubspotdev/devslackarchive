It works just fine by applying any other dates but them, I've tested with 27th of December and 01 January 2026.\n\nIs anybody having the same issue?\n\nFor more context, I'm looping through the dates and printing the dates in the HubDB as follows:\n\n```{% for row in data %}\n   {{row.date | format_date('d-M-YYYY')}}\n{% endfor %}```",
