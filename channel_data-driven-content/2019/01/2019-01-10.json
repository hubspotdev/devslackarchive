    "text": "I'm building dynamic pages in HubDB and struggling a bit with how to format content. There's no way to put HTML into HubDB Rich Text fields, is there? Or the ability to somehow customize the formatting more in Rich Text fields beyond the few options available (ie. seeing the source like you can with the rich text module)?\n\nAs an example, on this page <http://alabcboard.gov/licensing-compliance/license-types-fees> is a table I want to include in a HubDB field, but copying and pasting it in messes up the formatting (I can first paste into a plain text editor and then paste into HubDB which is a little better, but still not great). I know I could put that type of data into a child table, but the problem is this is just an example of the data for one row and other rows won't all have the data in HTML tables, the data will be in all different formats, so a child table won't work. So I was hoping for something flexible to preserve some legible formatting of all different types of content we need to enter for this column.",
