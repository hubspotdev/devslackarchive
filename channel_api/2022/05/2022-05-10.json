My question was in regards to an API authorization token?  I have a vendor that will be dropping sales contact data (so I dont have to manually enter the data and improve my sales efficiency) - I thought it was as simple as providing them my API however they mentioned an authorization token that I would need to provide, but I dont know where to find it.  I had another vendor that did the same thing and all they needed was my API key.  We ran a test contact and boom it came through simple as that.  Initially I am thinking that this shouldn't be overly complicated but am I missing something?  Is there a place I should be looking to get that code or are they getting something lost in translation.  I am a one man shop.",

Looking at what the UI does, it seems to edit the task and store it in a completely separate field and then return \"bodyPreviewHtml\" but I can't find a hack to do it through the API.
