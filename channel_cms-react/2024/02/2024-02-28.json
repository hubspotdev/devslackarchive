I admit it is kind of messy, but nothing new/different/or problematic here (in my humble opinion).\n\nThe only real concern I know of inline scripts in general is that they are “render blocking” and there can be issues with interleaving inline scripts between stylesheets… but I believe that isn’t a significant issue here with the inline script being so small and doing nothing except a few global sets (and that they are not in the head and put before the actual module html)."

(I’d like to check in what we can do to make this less different, but I’m yet sure if there is much we can do).\n\nThe second thing that does lead to some duplicated CSS in prod (but in a different way) is that `todo.module.css` is imported from both `Button.jsx` and `TodoList.jsx`. And that creates two separate duplicate CSS files (one named after button and one named after todolist). That can be worked around by refactoring `todo.module.css` into two separate files, but really you should not have to worry about that. I believe we can fix that, I’ll put that on our list."
