We figured it was best to cast a wide net in cases someone’s key was compromised. It could be anything from a script someone had that would expose their key to someone opening up the JS console and making a call one time to see what would happen.  Feel free to ping me directly if you have any questions. Happy to look up specific portals if you want"
