    "text": "Hello - I have an HTML/HUBL email template that is calling a custom global module. That module has smart content based on contact list membership. I have default content set up, plus content set up for 2 contact lists. When I preview the email, by default I see the default content - that's great. When I enter the email addresses of contacts for the 2 contact lists used for displaying the unique smart content, I still only see the default content. I would expect to see the unique content I have input for the 2 contact lists. What are some things I should look into to determine why I'm seeing the default content?",

    "text": "Okay so I tried copying the global module code snippet into the email template, even though it was already there and both files are published, and then the smart content started working in the email preview!\n\nDoes anyone know why the code snippet for the custom module changes with every click of \"copy snippet\"? If I make changes to it, I would expect those changes to be reflected where the module is included in email templates, without having to re-copy the snippet with every update made."
