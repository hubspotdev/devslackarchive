I know we can do things in Design Manager and build stuff using the preview in there, only problem is if you are doing something like a new blog design, the links in the preview will link to the exisitng blog so you can never truly get a full \"dev\" enviornment. Likewise, if you wanted to test new features in a blog post, you wouldnt be able to create a new post to test to them out (unless i am missing something). I know we have content staging and all that, I just wasnt sure if every portal get their main portal and then a free \"dev\" portal as well."
