    "text": "Hi all, I have a question about properties.\n\nI’m working in a company that works in name of a customer, I mean, my company is not the owner of the HubSpot account, we have access to query the HubSpot APIs.\n\nRetrieving contacts I’m retrieving some contact properties. One of them is `HubSpot_team_id`, defined as an `enumeration`, `select`, but have no options, I’m able to retrieve that team id, but I’m unable to identify how to retrieve the team name for a contact.\n\nThat property looks like:\n```{\n    \"name\": \"HubSpot_team_id\",\n    \"label\": \"HubSpot Team\",\n    \"description\": \"The team of the owner of a contact.\",\n    \"type\": \"enumeration\",\n    \"fieldType\": \"select\",\n    \"hidden\": false,\n    \"options\": [],\n    \"externalOptions\": true,\n    ...\n}```\nHave anyone any clue about how to retrieve those external options (with the IDs)?"

    "text": "Hey All - This post is concerning OneSignal, a Push Notification platform that we are trying to use alongside HubSpot. At the moment we have been trying to get the two systems to talk to each other, with OneSignal identifying users through a Player ID, but we are struggling applying that Player ID to a singular record.\n\nThe way we've been doing it is by hiding a HubSpot form in our header then use OneSignal's SDK to autofill and submit the form. However this leads to an often empty form submitted on every page view, which is troublesome because of the small number of customers that are identified by both HubSpot and OneSignal vs. only one or none. Is there a recommended or better way to update a contact's properties on a page view?"
