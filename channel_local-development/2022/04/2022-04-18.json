But for some reason, my search results page always shows no results no matter the term despite me having published a few sample website and blog pages to my sandbox environment. Has anyone experienced this before? I'm losing my mind trying to figure out why there are no results.",

    "text": "Thanks for the reply <@U02NJACH5QS> â€“ the website pages are meta robots noindex'ed. The blog pages aren't (or shouldn't be, at least). Digging around some documentation, I can that there's a specific HubSpotContentSearchBot... So I'm suspecting then that having my pages set to noindex without allowing the HubSpot content search bot is part of my problem here?"
