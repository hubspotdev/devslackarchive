I could make it in html but couldn´t in hubl. The module that I made is using glide css and js libraries but I cannot find a way to have the animation like this image, perphaps there is a style that I don´t know in glide that made this. if not I have to find another way to do it"

    "text": "Hey all, i'm tasked with moving a small Angular app from a windows server over to HubSpot, and I'm putting it in a module. So far it's been easy enough. But when i load the Angular scripts into the HubSpot page (they're stored in the design manager), the page throws a ReferenceError (\"a is not defined\") in angular.min.js itself. This error isn't on the windows server. Loading the unminified version is worse.\n\nI'm more of a Vue and React person -- any ideas?\n\nAnd yes, I know Angular is deprecated; replatforming wasn't my decision to make.\n\nAnd if you think I should cross-post this in another channel, I'd be glad to.",
