    "text": "Hello everyone! Can anyone tell me if `hbspt.forms.create` is now deprecated? I'm modifying an existing website and recently the forms became glitchy. Specifically, there appears to be an autofocus on the email field in the form, which I need to remove, and on mobile there seems to be an issue whereby the user cannot scroll on an embedded form.\n\nI'm trying to find back the documentation for this `hbspt.forms.create` function, but I'm unable to find it anywhere. All of the URLs I have tried in the past now seem to redirect to a new page, which is unrelated to this function. Would appreciate any pointers you've got for me, thank you :)"
