    "text": "Hey, am using a graphql request to grab to values from the CRM objects, but wanted to be able to set a default value for the name attribute for objects in the query that does not have a value for that property. I have looked through some HubSpot documentation for a couple hours now but can't seem to find anything. How can I in the graphql file set a default value for the name attribute for objects that are missing a value there. Here is my current graphql code: query CompanyQuery {\n  CRM {\n    company_collection {\n      items {\n        name\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}"
  }
