I am using this endpoint '`<https://api.hsforms.com/submissions/v3/integration/submit/>'`. I checked <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Forms-API-Associated-hidden-file-with-form/m-p/342520/highlight/true#M33495|this >article, but it has not worked for me. The flow I follow is:\n\n1. I get the files and upload them via the files API '`<https://api.hubapi.com/files/v3/files>`' \n2. I get the URL and add it to the JSON with the information from the form. (first image)\n3. I make use of the form API sending the data. The field I want to add the files to is `Upload Documents Here`\nIn HubSpot, the information appears correctly (second image), but in the files section, only one of the files is there. I think it is the first one that is selected.\n\nAnyone who can give me an idea how to solve it? :pray:",
