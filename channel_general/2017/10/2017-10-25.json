We did some digging and haven't seen anything in our metrics that would point to an issue at the moment, everything looks stable, no spikes in errors or drops in traffic to the v2.js file. We haven't made any changes to this file in a while so we don't have a recent update to point towards. If you're able to reproduce it still I'd recommend reaching out to our support team and they can run through a few troubleshooting steps and collect some data to pass on to my team."
