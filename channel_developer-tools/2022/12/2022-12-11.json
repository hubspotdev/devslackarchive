    "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have a question related to redirect urls in the apps. We have an app that is in the listing of HubSpot. Currently the strange thing here is: I am not seeing any redirect url in the app’s configuration page ( I can’t remember if I enter a value while I was creating it. ) please see the screenshot that I am attached. I am pretty sure that my oauth authorization through the app is working correctly and no redirect uri mismatch error occuring.\n\nThe problem here is: now I want extend my redirecturi’s by entering a new redirect uri but I can’t decide if I need to enter my old values etc? Is this situation somehow related my app is being verified?",
