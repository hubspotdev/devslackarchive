That should say instead “datetime”, which will be a result of the custom coded action within the workflow. The Property to Copy “DateTime” to will the one you will want to add your prop name to “Date/Time”. Please give this a try and if it doesn’t work let me know. Thank you!"

    "text": "Hi! I’m looking for a solution to be able to be notified when a “Call” or “Meeting” type of engagement takes place. Ideally we’d like to receive this via a webhook  with our app, when associations on a contact occur. But it looks like the types of associations on contacts that can trigger a webhook are fairly limited. I received a webhook notification when I created a deal on a contact, but my webhook did not receive a notification when I scheduled a meeting on a contact.\n\nFrom this page:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/webhooks>\n\ntowards the bottom I found the following list of associationTypes that work for webhooks, and it doesn’t seem to include any associations between contacts and engagements.\n\nIs there any other solution I should consider that could help us to receive notification or know when a call occurs? We considered using a workflow but if we let any companies use our app they would have to have upgraded hubs including workflows for us to impliment a workflow in their hub.\n\nAny suggestions or guidance on how to accomplish this would be greatly appreciated.",
