One additional little parameter you can use to make creating the query perhaps a bit easier, is using the “params”, parameter, which allows you to provide the query parameters as an object. Those parameters will then be translated as url query parameters when you make your request. I wrote a quick snippet that might be helpful:\n\n```exports.main = async (event, callback) => {\t\nlet getContactOptions = {\n\t\tmethod: \"GET\",\n\t\turl: `<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/${contactId}>`,\n\t\theaders: {\n\t\t\t\"Content-type\": \"application/json\",\n\t\t\tAuthorization: `Bearer ${hsKey}`\n\t\t},\n\t\tparams: {\n\t\t\tproperties: \"firstname, lastname, phone\",\n\t\t\tpropertiesWithHistory: \"domain, address\"\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\n\tlet contactRes = await axios(getContactOptions);\n\tlet contact = contactRes.data;\n\tconsole.log(\"contact\", contact);\n}```\nGood luck!"
