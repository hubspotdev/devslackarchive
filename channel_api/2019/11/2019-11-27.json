Sensitive files, as defined by our Terms of Service (<https://legal.HubSpot.com/terms-of-service>) should _never_ be uploaded to the file manager, per the documentation Adam cited.\n\n<@UPUNJBVK5> mentioned “private files,” which I (perhaps mistakenly) interpreted as _non-sensitive_ information that he simply wanted to make inaccessible from the public CDN link. Adding `hidden=true` makes files inaccessible from public CDN links, but these files still shouldn’t contain truly sensitive information. Am I misunderstanding something?"

    "text": "<@UDDJG2VFG> The responses I’ve gotten from my support ticket haven’t been specific about particular findings, rather they’re just acknowledging there’s a problem and they’re trying to fix it. But what I reported is that files uploaded by our salespeople in the Attachments sidebar of deals using the `Upload file` button are intermittently ending up in the Marketing side of the file manager with public CDN links.\n\nTo me, the two most obvious ways that would happen is if `hidden=true` isn’t 100% reliable or the CRM UI isn’t always passing `hidden=true`\n\nNow, the big problem here is the expectation that people should be able to safely upload deal documents to their CRM. If we want to say that things like wire instructions and CC numbers shouldn’t be in the CRM (per the definition of _*sensitive*_ information in your TOS), I completely agree. But there are plenty of documents that don’t contain banking information that your customers would still consider private/confidential and wouldn’t want having public CDN links. Yet, your own documentation says the Files API shouldn’t be used for sensitive _*or confidential*_ documents, and your CRM interface uses that endpoint to handle deal attachments.\n\nThe not-very-satisfactory answer I got on this Slack a couple months ago was that there’s something special that happens when that upload is done via the UI, so it’s more that the external developers’ API shouldn’t be used for that purpose. But there seems to be issues with whatever hacky workaround was employed there when *customer contracts* we upload in the UI are still intermittently showing up with public CDN links."
