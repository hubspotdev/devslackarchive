I put the module on the landing page and I layout it like a recent blog post, And when I'm creating a new blog post, the new blog is updating on the blog itself, but it's not updating on my module I made same as the code of the blog. But on the developer's preview it's updating, but on the landing page it's not updating. and I also try to create a new landing page and put the same module. When the status of landing page is draft the changes is reflected but when I publish the landing page the changes is not reflected What could be the reason of that?",
