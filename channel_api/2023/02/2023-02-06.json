    "text": "Hi everyone!\nHaving a bit of an issue with batch archiving labelled associations between contacts and companies. We have contact:company associations with multiple labels, say, \"contact_1\"  associated with \"company_1\" with labels \"label_1\" and \"label_2\". We would like to delete/archive in batch specific labels from specific contact&lt;-&gt;company associations, let's say \"label_2\" between \"contact_1\" and \"contact_2\". The `POST .../crm/v3/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/archive` end-point accepts both contact and company ids as well as label types as inputs, however, calling it removes all labels/association between the two objects, and not just the specified label. So the question is, is it possible to delete specific labels only between specific objects in such a call?\nThank you!"
