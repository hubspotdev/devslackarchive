    "text": "Hello all,\nI am doing tests to check if and how it is possible to migrate a page made with drag &amp; drop template with a template created from a theme.\nThe first test was done using content staging, which would be the most logical thing to do; unfortunately, when I published the page, previously created in content staging, using a template of a theme, I lost all the access data and the various reports.\nSo I addressed by cloning the \"old\" page first so as not to lose the data and then applying ... or rather trying to apply a theme template; here too a huge disappointment because of all the templates of the theme, he only sees ... a blank page, clay yes with a theme, but wow, only that one sees?\nAh, if I try to create a page from scratch, I can choose from all the theme templates but even in doing so I would lose all the data reports.\nAt this point I ask you: how do you do it? Have you had a case where you had to apply a new theme to a site, created with the drag &amp; drop system?",
