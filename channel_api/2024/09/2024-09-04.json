Do you know if this is something I can avoid? Being an `upsert` it should either create or update a contact, not error on a conflict.\n\nI know that 409 usually means that those contacts were deleted (archived). I've deleted all recoverable contacts, and it's still the same."

If not, I sadly have no other advice. Good luck! :slightly_smiling_face:"

    "text": "As a quick addition to this, this is also something you might see if you're trying to do `upsert` to create a contact and then have any sort of webhook or external flow to update it immediately afterwards (I know some folks like to do the \"create a contact\" then \"give the contact the data\" rather than doing it as part of creation).\n\nIf you've just _created_ a new contact, it can take several minutes, not seconds, to appear in the search index. So always worth delaying any calls like that until 5-10m after a contact creation. :slightly_smiling_face:"

Any tips or other things I should check out? Any insight from someone inside HubSpot? I’m stumped :sweat_smile:",
