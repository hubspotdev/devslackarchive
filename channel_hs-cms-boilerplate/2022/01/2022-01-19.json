    "text": "As Jacob noted, REM is typically best practice and is used in the boilerplate but you are free to use the units that your team wants to use.\n\nThe boilerplate uses px in certain areas for aesthetic reasons. For example for borders, they’re defined in px in the boilerplate. It’s subjective, but we likely just didn’t want the border size to change for different screen sizes for purely aesthetic reasons."
