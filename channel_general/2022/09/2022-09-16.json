    "text": "<@U02M9GZTEGH> *Interesting*, haven't tried it yet. But i would test it first with a `octet-stream` and url-encoded string  like this:\n```&lt;a href=\"data:application/octet-stream,{{ url_encoded_csv }}\" download=\"filename.csv\"&gt;CSV-Btn-Label&lt;/a&gt;```\nYou can also try: `data:text/csv;charset=utf-8;`  with a blob file, created with JavaScript. But this make things more complicate that might be.\n\nCSV it self is very simple. I wound suggest to create an array of rows for the table content in a seperate &lt;script/&gt; section of your template, and push there all the needed information from from the Hubl QUOTE object into that array. In the end you can join and url-encode that array with JavaScript or HubL, both is possible.\n```{% set rows = [\n    [\"product\", \"price\", \"amount\", \"etc\"],\n    [\"name\", \"100$\",  \"13\", \"etc\"]\n] %}```\nColumns are seperated in CSV with  \",\" and Rows are seperated with \"\\r\\n\". If you dont like to code the string yourself, search for jQuery CSV converter. Would be nice to hear how you sloved it in the end."

    "text": "Hi All, was hoping to get some help on this issue. I'm trying to import some components from my TS React project and use some edited React boiler plate CMS code to send them to HubSpot. Unfortunately I'm having more trouble than I would have thought. The structure of my project is a main folder with `HubSpot_landing` folder holding all of the cms code and a `src` folder holding all of my components for my website. I've attached my `webpack.config.js` which seems to be effectively compiling the TypeScript files and have also copied in my `tsconfig.json` . I'm trying to import a component from my `src` folder over to `HubSpot_landing` , but keep getting module not found errors. The import statement is `import ContactForm from '~/components/elements/forms/ContactForm.tsx'` . Would really appreciate some help on this.\n\nEDIT: Following up here to add more detail\n\n<https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/CMXUWUY5D/p1663360391764229?thread_ts=1663354320.749309&amp;cid=CMXUWUY5D>",

I have tried attaching as a &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt;, as well as attaching the file directly, and neither works. When I go into the inspector, I see the stylesheet is present, but none of the elements I am targeting have the CSS I wrote are changing. It’s not even getting overwritten by other CSS - it’s just not there at all. I have tried this with many different elements, so it’s not just one misspelling or anything. Can you help me understand why this might be? I have checked the minified CSS file and it appears to be just fine - no translation errors into the minified file.",
