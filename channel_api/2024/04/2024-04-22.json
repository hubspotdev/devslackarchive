When I run the lambda (locally via `sam local invoke` and testing in the cloud produce the same behaviour), it stops once it gets to any line involving the HubSpotClient instance. No error is thrown.\n\nHere’s my code:\n\n```const HubSpotClient = new HubSpot.Client({ accessToken: HubSpotAccessToken });\n\nconst createContactInHubSpot = async (contactInputItem: ContactInputItem): Promise<string> => {\n    let contactId: string;\n   \n    try {\n      // create contact\n      console.log('enters try block of createContactInHubSpot()'); // this line prints\n      let createContactsResponse = await HubSpotClient.crm.contacts.batchApi.create({inputs: [contactInputItem]});\n      console.log('createContactsResponse'); // this line does not print\n       \n      contactId = createContactsResponse.results[0].id\n      return contactId;\n    } catch (e: any) {\n      if (e.body.message = 'Contact already exists.') {\n        let contactId = await findContactByEmail(contactInputItem.properties.email as string);\n        return contactId;\n      }\n      throw new Error('could not create contact, and contact did not already exist with that email address');\n    }\n  }```\nThe first console.log statement is printed, the 2nd is not, and there is no error thrown.\n\nOne thing I do notice, is that when I `console.log(HubSpotClient)` it returns\n```{\"config\":{\"accessToken\":\"xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"}}```\nWhich does not have any methods as I would expect. Below is what I expect based on the same console.log() in a different project\n\n```{\n config: { accessToken: 'xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx' },\n _automation: undefined,\n _cms: undefined,\n _communicationPreferences: undefined,\n _conversations: undefined,\n _crm: undefined,\n _events: undefined,\n _files: undefined,\n _marketing: undefined,\n _oauth: undefined,\n _settings: undefined,\n _webhooks: undefined\n}```"
