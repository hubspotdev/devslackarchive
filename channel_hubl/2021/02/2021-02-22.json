I am trying to use *<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/using-modules-in-templates#field-based-parameters|Field Based Parameters>* when adding a custom global module to my template.\nLike so:\n`{% module \"module_global_module\" path=\"/Website/modules/__global_modules/test_module\" label=\"Test Module\", my_text_field='Hello' %}`\n\nHowever the value isn't being passed on to the rendered page. Could it be that *Field Based Parameters* only work for Local Modules and not Global Modules?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:"

    "text": "Hey Olia, the best example of this would be to look at our *<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate|CMS boilerplate>*. Below is an image to help illustrate. Essentially, you are creating a block in a base.html file that acts as a placeholder or location for the content that will be on the other template. In our example, you can see we have an empty `{%block body %}…{%endblock body%}` in our `base template`. When you then look at the code in the `about template`, there is a call <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/main/src/templates/about.html#L7|on line 7> that is telling the  `about template` to extend the base template and reference that template. In <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/main/src/templates/about.html#L9-L42|lines 9 - 42 on the >`about template` this is essentially saying “use the following content to replace the `body block` from the `base template`”.",
