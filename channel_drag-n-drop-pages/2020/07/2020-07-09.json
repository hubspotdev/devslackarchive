Our UX rules tend to be that if something isn’t available, it should show as disabled so that we can tell the end user why they don’t have access to it. That being said, we can probably do a better job of explaining in that message--I can definitely look into that :slightly_smiling_face:"

Right now, content can only be swapped to other templates of the same type (i.e. an old legacy template can only be swapped to a legacy template, and a coded file with DND area can only be swapped to another coded file with DND area). My team is working on a fix for this though, if you'd like to be a part of the beta group just let me or <@ULCSUPTGU> know!"
