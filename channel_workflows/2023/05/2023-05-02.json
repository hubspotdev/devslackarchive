If you toggle “custom mode”, you’ll be able to see the function along with sample output so you can test it.\n\nIf you hover over the function name, you’ll also be able to see some documentation and sample values for this function.\n\nIn this case, it looks like the format you’re looking for is `%m/%d/%Y`!\n\nHere’s the relevant knowledge base article: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/filters#datetimeformat>"
