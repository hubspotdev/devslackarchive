    "text": "I've got an interesting problem with HubDB dynamic pages.  We've got a \"Customer Stories\" dynamic page.  The situation is that we would like to hide certain stories from the listing page, but still have them available to share with potential clients.\n\nRight now, I've just added a boolean column to set the items in the listing to `display: none`.  This is working, but the problem is that these \"hidden\" pages are still being indexed by Google.\n\nWondering if there is a way to add meta tags to the head of dynamic pages so I could prevent indexing?",
