    "text": "Good morning colleagues! I'm having some problems with HS forms in some of my pages (built with React components). First of all, I want to point out that I use the forms retrieved from the HS account, I don't customize them in any way through code and I also add them as a component in my pages. The problem I am facing is that, sometimes, the thank you page does not work (it is blank and without any html content loaded), even if I have configured it in the CMS.",
