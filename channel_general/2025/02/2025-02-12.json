    "text": "*Hi,*\n\nI’m trying to build a report in HubSpot to track how many web bookings were preceded by a call to the call center. The goal is to identify contacts who:\n1. Had a recorded call in HubSpot *before* they booked online.\n2. Have a *confirmed booking* (moved to “Confirmed” stage).\n3. The *call timestamp* should be *before* the “Most Recent Confirmed Booking Date.”\nI’ve applied some filters, but I’m not sure how to correctly set up the time-based condition between the last call and the booking date. Right now, my report only filters calls within the last 14 days, which is incorrect.\nCould you guide me on the best way to structure this? Is there a way to compare *\"Last Aircall Call Timestamp\"* with *\"Most Recent Confirmed Booking Date\"* within the report builder?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!"

We ran into an issue where the forms merged contacts, presumably ones generated from the same browser session.\n\nFor example, they have sales reps who may help customers sign in or set up an account. They also have people working in the same office who are being merged into one contact.\n\nDoes anybody have experience with this? We want it to work the same way as the HubSpot native forms, where we can create a new contact every time a new email address is used.\n\nThanks in advance!"
