    "text": "I discovered a couple weeks ago I noticed HubSpot released a new feature to help with the friction of completing a registration called “Follow-Up Emails”.  The feature will follow up with users who don’t finish registration at intervals you decide upon.  I was excited about this because like other a significant percentage of our users are getting stuck at registration.\n\nI was disappointed to learn that the feature doesn’t allow you to edit the follow up emails that are sent like you can for the registration and password reset.  You also can’t change the subject line which defaults to “special offer”.  This doesn’t match the context of our membership pages at all and I don’t think it is a good subject line for a registration re-engagement if it did.\n\nDoes anyone know of a workaround?  If you’ve experienced the issue like I have please upvote my idea here:\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Make-quot-followup-email-quot-editable-in-private-content/idi-p/868909>"
