    "text": "Hi, I have a HublDB that holds a listing of videos. On the dynamic page, I want to open the video in a lightbox, but when I try to grab the friendly link by file id it tells gives me the following error:\n`Warning in file_by_id: no file exists with ID 36723383848`\nThis is the actual ID of the video.  If I hard code the id, it works fine:\n `{% set file = file_by_id(36723383846) %}` \n `{{ file.friendlyUrl }}`\n\nThe second you put a variable in for file_by_id it throws an error. The following fails:\n`{% set file = file_by_id(row.video|int) %}` \n`{{ file.friendlyUrl }}`"
