    "text": "I know the topic of getting rate limit errors in custom code workflows has been talked about a lot on here but I’ve never really seen anyone provide a real solution that works. I’ve added throttling to my code and still errors come up when running a large amount of contacts through the workflow. I know the code works. So why it doesn’t work well in HubSpot beats me. I read the only solution that truly works is token bucket so I’m trying to figure out how to implement that.\nBut when I add throttling to the code contacts get time out and shows they successfully completed the workflow but they really don’t.\nAlso, when I use the merge dupe contacts workflow it only picks up contacts that have the exact same phone number with the exact same formatting. So if two contacts have the same phone number but not the same formatting it doesn’t pick them up. I setup a function to handle the formatting, but this rate limit error issue is making my workflow not work.\n\nAnybody have any feedback that can help me out with this?",
