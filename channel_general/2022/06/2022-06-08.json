    "text": "Hello Fellow Developers!\nHope you are all doing well.\nI’ve been working with my team for a while on optimising Page Speed on websites on HubSpot CMS,like 4 years :slightly_smiling_face:, and it got a lot better recently.\nBut still, after making all the required optimisations on websites build with themes: images, lazyloading, vanillaks, third party app reduction, defering scripts, reducing page size, hs boilerplate...\nWe’ve reached a point where we cant get above 50 - 60, in terms of Page Speed mobile.\nThe same usual suspects for this :\n• layout.min.css\n• cta.js\n• forms.js\n• hs-scripts.js\n:point_right:.... everything that makes HubSpot useful!\nAny new insights on this subject?\nAnything you discovered on your end?\nThank you! :pray:"

    "text": "Hello! I posted an idea today regarding a feature that would allow developers to recommend specific modules for use on a template in a theme and have those modules highlighted in the page editor, similar to the way the common HubSpot modules and theme modules are today. This would give us the ability to make templates that are flexible but still geared towards a specific purpose. I provided an example in the post. \n\nIf you like the sound of this, please feel free to give the idea an upvote! \n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Recommended-Modules-per-Template/idi-p/646667|https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Recommended-Modules-per-Template/idi-p/646667>"
