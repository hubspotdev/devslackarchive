We’re trying to have a card act as somewhat of a flow, but the only way we can do that as of now is to have the user refresh the page after interacting with the card to see the next step. I’ve looked into it for a bit now, and the functionality appears to not exist, but I figured I’d give it one last try here! :sweat_smile:",
