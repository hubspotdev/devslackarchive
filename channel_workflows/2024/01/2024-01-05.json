Now I am trying to get the app working in workflows and I have been able to install it with Postman, my app shows up in workflow but when I try to test it my server doesn't receive any data from HubSpot. Can somebody help me understand why it doesn't get any data. I have tested the actionurl to make sure it works, which it does. Thank you for your help!"
