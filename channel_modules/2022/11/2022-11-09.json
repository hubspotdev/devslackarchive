Kind of in a hurdle here with my code, hopefully I can figure out some solutions here...\n\nI'm trying to make the entire module cards into hoverable link, which is a success! However, each card links to a different URL, which is my problem. Because each card has a cta_field to it, I want to be able to have the card link to the proper cta link that it's associated with.\nListed below is  the entire card. I made each card with different ctas. I tested out some code and was able to turn each entire card div into hoverable links!...but with only one type of url lol I was just testing things out.",

I managed to test out code from: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Get-URL-from-CTA/m-p/208951> and it worked fine, but for only one type of cta. As mentioned, each card will have seperate cta urls.\n\nAnd listed below is the module group I am working with.\nI tried to target cta_field_1 by doing {{cta_field_1.src}} or {{item.cta_field_1.src}} but can't figure it out still. I want to be able to extract this so that way, the card will link to whatever cta_field it is associated with by default.\n\nIdk if that makes sense, I've been at this for 3 hours.\n\nThank you!!",
