    "text": "Awesome that you solved it.\nJust a few pointers to help you in GraphQL:\n1. `!` in GraphQL means that the value returned in non-nullable. Basically you’re asking GraphQL to *always* return a value, and fail if it doesn’t have any.\n2. The error messages in GraphQL are actually very good, and I’ve been caught in trying to grab the wrong type of variable multiple times. In your case you asked for a `String`, however the returned value was a Number, thus the error.\nKnowing these things help you debug, and secure your endpoints. Basically like TypeScript helps us write stronger code.\n<https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields>"
