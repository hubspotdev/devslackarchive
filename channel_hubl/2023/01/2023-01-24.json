    "text": "Hello, I developed a listing and posting template that dynamically updates based on custom object data. However, I am unable to call more than 400 “units” at a time due to HubSpot’s offset rule. I’ve gone in and added some code to allow for the offset (see below), but it doesn’t work for more than 400. Does anyone have any suggestions or experience with allowing all custom object data to show on a dynamic template?\n\n{% set tests = crm_objects(“unit”, “limit=100&amp;offset=0”, “building_address,building_name,unit_name,bedroom_count,neighborhood,unit__,status,renewal_status”) %}\n                    {% set a = crm_objects(“unit”, “limit=100&amp;offset=100\", “building_address,building_name,unit_name,bedroom_count,neighborhood,unit__,status,renewal_status”) %}\n                    {% set b = crm_objects(“unit”, “limit=100&amp;offset=200”, “building_address,building_name,unit_name,bedroom_count,neighborhood,unit__,status,renewal_status”) %}\n                    {% set c = crm_objects(“unit”, “limit=100&amp;offset=300\", “building_address,building_name,unit_name,bedroom_count,neighborhood,unit__,status,renewal_status”) %}\n                    {% set d = crm_objects(“unit”, “limit=100&amp;offset=400”, “building_address,building_name,unit_name,bedroom_count,neighborhood,unit__,status,renewal_status”) %}"

Is it possible to make it separate without having to clone the module? Ideally don't want like 10 image modules.\n\nCurrently I'm copying the same snippet in the email template",
