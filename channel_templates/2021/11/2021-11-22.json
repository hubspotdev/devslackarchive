Another option woulld be to load up these types of options in hubdb, and index your pages, returning the content based on that.\n\nThere might be some other solutions, but all would require some use of a different method then normal native search.  check here for what you can do <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/content/search-for-content>"
