Is there any way I can set this up (aside from creating all properties for this)? I've found the filter |safe in <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/filters> but not working. Can anyone of you help me with this?",

    "text": "Hey Justin. HTML is escaped in emails by default to prevent abuse with external data ending up in emails. The safe filter is not working for you because HubL filters are not available in email today. If its available to you, you could use <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/email/create-programmable-emails|the Programmable Email Beta>, which enables HubL in Email. This would allow you to use the `|safe` filter"
