Or is it wiser to say \"ok take the value that you have for desktop and make it 50% of that size for tablet and 30% for mobile\"? Love to hear your thoughts on that as it is giving me a huge headache..",

So, you could theoretically be able to set which rich text options a content creator sees when they’re editing rich text on the page. \n2. We’re also exploring allowing mobile editing at the page level. So, you could switch to view the mobile version of the page in the editor, and make certain changes to that mobile version. For v1, content creators would be pretty restricted, maybe just adjusting margin and padding and also hiding modules on mobile, but the idea would be to slowly expand the things you could do on the mobile version.\nCurious what you all think of that!"
