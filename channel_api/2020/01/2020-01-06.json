    "text": "<@UQERM7BLY> and <@U26BLKGE4> I took the time to read on how to create scheduled jobs on heroku and it seems that this is feasible. Thanks for your help on this, but I still have a question. I figured out how to create a job that will \"look\" everyday if there is job(s) to execute, but I don't understand how I can queue a job for the future on a specific date. In my program, I `GET` my execution date in a unix date format such as \"1609950904\" for Wednesday 6 January 2021. I am wondering How I could use this date to queue a job that my heroku process will be able to catch on the proper date.. any idea? I'm using node.js"

If someone downloads multiple products (visits the same form multiple times) the field gets overwritten.\n\nIf I change this to a multiple checkbox this works but having to manually add each new product version would be hard to maintain.\n\nSo when someone submits the form I would like to check the \"product download\" field and append a new value if it isn't already selected instead of completely wiping it out. Is there a way to get this to work with your solution above? Or are these completely different things?"
