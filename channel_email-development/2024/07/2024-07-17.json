    "text": "The Padding styles option is universal to all email modules — it’s more of a “wrapper” for modules than a true style field.\n\nUp until about two weeks ago, when the “Styles” tab was added to email modules, the Padding toggle was located at the bottom of the content tab for every module. So, it’s just you: the Styles tab _did in fact_ just suddenly appear on your modules.\n\nSo, effectively: no, there isn’t a way to remove it. If you’d like to advise users to not use the padding option, I’d suggests adding inline help text to the module instructing them to keep it disabled."
