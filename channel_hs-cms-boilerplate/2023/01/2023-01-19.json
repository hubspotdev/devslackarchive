    "text": ":face_with_cowboy_hat: Just released a new minor version of the boilerplate (v3.8.0 <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/releases/tag/v3.8.0>) This adds support for handling either version of the search input module v0 or v1. New versions of the search input and search results modules have been rolled out to new portals, this adds some minor adjustments to keep things working the same in either case."
