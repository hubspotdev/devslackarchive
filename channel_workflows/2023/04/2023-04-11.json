We have a external API source that feeds us inform and we store this as a string in a contact property. See the below example:\n```Storage Service: No\nMoving Date: 2022-12-16\nSpecial Instructions:```\nI am able to extract the date from this string using a custom code action in a workflow with some regex:\n```preferred_move_date: event.fields.contact_data.match(/(?&lt;=Moving Date: )[\\s\\S]*\\n(?=Special Instructions:)/)[0]```\nThe challenge I am facing is that the property we are trying to copy the date to is a date picker property (dd/mm/yyyy) - is there a way to format this date from a string to date in the same workflow?\n\nThe only other way is that I create another date property which I am reluctant to do as I would like to keep my CRM as lean as possible",
