    "text": "Hi team\n\nI would like to request your advice. I work like developer in a commercial area and recently we have been to migrate some pages at HubSpot. Now I know that HubSpot has HubDB but it isn´t develop for keep sensitive data also It isn´t possible to keep a session like in a server. So, my question is, It´s a good idea migrate a site that has transactional tasks like payments, upload documents, requests to another services, etc? or maybe for that cases is better keep the site in GCP for example?\nMaybe it´s impossible keep a site of this kind in HubSpot.\n\nThanks for your time.",
