If you use require_js or linked javascript files in your module the JS will only ever load once per page regardless of the number of modules that request the file.\n\nAdditionally the JS file will then load only when that module or another module that also calls that file is used.\n\nThis means it’s more performant to tie the file to your module.\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/files#javascript-module-js->\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/files#require-js>"
