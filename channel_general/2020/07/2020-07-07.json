My firm is looking to hire a developer to help us create a multi-filtering feature for the success story page of our website (and possibly blog) built on the HubSpot platform. We are also using the Neambo Act template in HubSpot. I'm 1) Trying to learn what a ballpark time estimate might be so I can know how to price this job and 2) wondering if there's a forum here to hire someone? Or else we'll take it to upwork, etc. Thanks for any info!",
