    "text": "BUG: get_asset_url inside of fields.json seemingly not working any more\n==================\n\nI feel like ive been using get_asset_url() in fields.json in past theme builds and it’s worked fine to grab and access default images that port around with my theme. However now I am running into an issue where its not able to be accessed in statement form. It is, however, working when I `pprint` it.\n\nExample:\nIn the images below you can see that im using the same statement reference — the only difference being that I pprint the one up top and dont in the one below. The output shows that the pprint is clearly returning a value, and if you visit the link it is the desired image, and the non pprinted statement returns nothing.\n\nThoughts?",
