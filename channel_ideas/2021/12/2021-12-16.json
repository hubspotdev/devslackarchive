    "text": "I wish `&amp;&amp;` in HubL worked like it does in JS and like `||` does in HubL and JS, with short-circuit evaluation. So if you did `{{ some_variable &amp;&amp; some_other_variable }}` , it would be `some_other_variable` if `some_variable` is truthy. Instead it just returns `true`. So instead we have to set up an extra if statement or use ternary, both make the code look much messier to me.\nEDIT: I just tested this in Jinja and Jinja2 and both behave as it does in JS, the way I want, where `{{ some_variable and some_other_variable }}` returns `some_other_variable` when `some_variable` is truthy, which means HubSpot must have changed the implementation? :disappointed: Or maybe this is a bug? The more I think about it, the more likely it seems like this is a bug.",
