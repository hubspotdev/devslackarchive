    "text": "-- Workflow help needed --\n\nI am trying to send Slack notifications from HubSpot upon intent signals coming from Zoominfo.\nThe issue is to only send details regarding the latest intent.\n\nThere are fields for each intent keyword in HubSpot that get updated when Zoominfo passes over new data if they detect new intent. We track 6 keywords that have 5 fields each.\nLet's simplify:\n\nIntent A - ID\nIntent A - Date\nIntent A - Location\n\nIntent B - ID\nIntent B - Date\nIntent B - Location\n.....\n\nI would like to only include the intent in the Slack notification that is the latest in order for users to not see 30 fields when most is unchanged. I would like to only show the details of the latest one.\n\nI think the solution is a calculated field for \"Latest Intent\". (unless you have a better idea). But how to populate it?\nLatest Intent - ID\nLatest Intent - Date\nLatest Intent - Location\n\nHubSpot would need to evaluate which intent (A, B, C...) was updated the latest and push the values of fields the associated fields into the \"Latest\" fields.\n\nI haven't found a way to achieve this just yet but I am hoping with the great minds here someone might know the way :)"

This is the latest endpoint I see to enroll a contact into an existing workflow: <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/workflows/add_contact>\nMy issue is the contact's email is null.  I want to enroll a contact using the Contact ID.\n\nHas anyone figured out a way to tackle this?"
