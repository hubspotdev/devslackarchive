Whether you need to enable those features or not you should ask a lawyer, or bring it up to the business you are building the site for and ask them to consult a lawyer to see if they need to comply.\n\nSeeing as HubSpot makes it relatively easy to comply with most aspects of GDPR and seeing as GDPR’s rules are basically best practice anyways, many people opt to just skip the lawyer and do it anyways, whether or not they are legally required to."

    "text": "There used to be a similar tool that unfortunately eventually got taken down(another service bought them out then they went under). It was a bit unique, it was called pipebytes.\n\nIt was a website similar to this where you upload a file then send someone a link or a code to enter. And the interesting part was the way they handled uploading/downloading.\n\nThe file would upload to the server at first until the recipient started downloading, then once the recipient started downloading it would create  some sort of direct SSL transmission between your computer and the recipients computer to transmit the rest of the file. The pipebytes server itself, would instantly delete the file after 100% completion of the download on the user’s end. Both the sender and recipient could see the upload/download progress.\n\nSo if you had the recipient already on the page before the sender started the upload, the connection supposedly was completely direct, no file stored on pipebytes.\n\nIt was pretty freaking cool."

Even if there was you could retake it later and submit the same 1.\n\nThe multiple choice test, that one does have a timer i believe. I think the estimated time he said it could take is like 45 mins. I think i finished in about 15 minutes, and that was while also taking screenshots to provide feedback. Take your time on it though to prevent accidentally tripping yourself up. And even if youve been doing HubSpot dev work a long time review the cms for developers course before taking it as some questions are based on the course and you may not know the answer just from experience."
