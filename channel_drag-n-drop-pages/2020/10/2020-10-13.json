    "text": "If youre trying to make a “flexible” way to allow a user to overlap content on top of “divider shape” a solution I came up with a few days ago actually is to add a toggle to the “divider-shape” module that absolutely positions the shape.\n\nPut that divider shape module in its own section with no padding and make it full width.\n\nThe padding on the section beneath it then controls how far up into the shape the content goes. Pretty nifty workaround for what I think youre trying to achieve! Hope it helps!"
