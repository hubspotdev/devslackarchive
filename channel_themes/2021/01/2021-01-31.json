I have some spalling mistake in the Theme naming but now I'm unable to modify the name of my Listed theme in the product listing. I remove the theme on the listing and change the theme name published again on Listing but the same spelling error found on the listed product. I changed the theme name label on the JSON file but the name not changing on the listing.\nAm I missing something or there is some other way to modify it?\nAny help would be very appreciated. Thanks, everyone!",
