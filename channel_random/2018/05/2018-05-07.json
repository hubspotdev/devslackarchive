    "text": "For those here with more WordPress experience than me: Any tips or favorite plugins to safely (and hopefully dramatically) reduce the size of a WP media library? We have a real estate client looking to change hosts (preferably managed a la WP Engine), and between property brochure PDFs and client-uploaded uncompressed images, their total install is over 30GBs of files, 90% of which being images and other assets in the media library. I know the right answer is going back and deleting unused assets, but that's not really an option right now because of time constraints; I just need to get the install small enough to move them on one of the cheaper WP Engine or Flywheel packages; they only have one site and use about 15gb of bandwidth per month, they don't need an enterprise plan."
