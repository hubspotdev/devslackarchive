    "text": "Hello @all,\n\nI've designed a simple page with a form where the user can enter their basic information and a contact will be generated and placed to the appropriate List. When a contact is added to the list, an email should be sent to prompt them to set a password. Unfortunately, that email is not being sent automatically.\n\nFurthermore, the site has three business units (3 domains). When I manually trigger the registration email, it sends the email with a different domain URL and name. Despite the fact that I have configured everything in the private content page of settings with the correct domain.",
