    "text": "Hello again!  I am looking for some help understanding what this error message is describing `{\"message\":\"Json node is missing child properties\"}`. My serverless function is trying to update a contact's properties, so I am working with a few different JSON objects and so Im confused as to whether this message is referring to something in my code, or something related to Node. Anyways, if anyone can help me dig into this error, that would be amazing! Apologies for posting so much in this channel, the HubSpot team has been great at helping me finding solutions to the issues I have been facing and I am not quite sure where else to ask about questions like this",
