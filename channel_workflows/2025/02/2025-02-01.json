    "text": "Hi Kevin! Not sure if you still need help with this, but I just encountered this issue myself as well.\n\nWhat I did:\n• Create a custom number property (to represent a boolean value).\n• Add all objects to a static list\n• Set that custom property to 0 at the end of the workflow\n• When the flow succeeds, leave the value at 0 (or set it to 1 with a delay for periodic enrollment, that's what I did)\n• When the flow errors, you can branch per step, set a delay of 1 day (depending on how the rate limit is structured), and set the custom property value after that delay to 1\nFor re-enrollment, specify the list membership and the value of that custom property being 1. This is a basic retry mechanism, helping you spread out the API calls over time\n\nHope this helps!"
