    "text": "I am trying to set up *System Page Templates* that can use the *Language Smart Rule*.\n\nI have checked the language options in the the HubSpot knowledge base but can't seem to track down this answer.\n\nI am working on a client site that is in English and French. Currently they use seperate pages for French but we are migrating them over to pages with smart rules for the two languages. Currently the default is English and the other is French. This may get expanded to other languages in a future project.\n\nWe have the site more or less set up and ready to put our new draft smart pages alive. I am however stuck coding the template for system pages in both languages. For instance in our hero module I have this attribute:\n```{% module_block module \"module_hero\" wrapping_html='', per_widget_wrapper_html='', overrideable=True, widget_name='my-hero', path='/my-theme/my-custom-modules/my-hero', label='My Hero' %}\n{% module_attribute \"page_header\" is_json=True %}\n{ \"page_title\":\"Page Not Found / Page Non Trouvée\",\n\"secondary_header\":\"\"\n}\n{% end_module_attribute %}\n{% end_module_block %}```\nIs there a way to code the page to allow for smart rules to be applied to the module attributes?\n\nWhat I am looking for is something like this: (truncated to show only what may be needed)\n```{% module_block module ... %}\n{% if smartrule[language] == \"english\" %}\nPage not found\n{% elif smartrule[language] == \"french\" %}\nPage Non Trouvée\n{% endif %}```\nOr is there a way to assign a 404 system page for English browsers and another 404 system page for French browsers?\n\nAny help will be appreciated.",
