    "text": "Greetings everyone,\n\nNew here, and new to developing in HubSpot. Been familiarizing myself with HubSpot APIs and private apps.\n\nMy question – is there a way to make a Workflow trigger a private app – in a way that *doesn't* require a Webhook or a Custom Code Action?\n\nFor context, we simply want to select Contact(s) in HubSpot, solicit some user input, then save new Deal(s) via API. We can already accomplish _most_ of this with a workflow – except of course for the pesky \"solicit user input\" part.\n\nIs this a use case for a Custom Workflow Action?\n\nI see that Webhooks and Custom Code Actions require Operations Hub Professional ($$$), and as of yet, I'm unable to deduce if Custom Workflow Actions are in the same boat. At the moment, our use case is too small for that upgrade – so, sniffing around for ways to accomplish without the expense.\n\nThank you and nice-weekend wishes to all",
