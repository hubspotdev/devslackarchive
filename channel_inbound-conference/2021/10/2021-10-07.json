You may get some sneak peaks at INBOUND.\n\nOther than that INBOUND is a great way to get to know the rest of the HubSpot platform as well as learn skills that are development adjacent.\n\nThere are sessions on SEO, marketing, sales, email, personal growth, soft-skills etc.\n\nThere will also be some interesting virtual meetups during INBOUND that may be interesting for devs. For example: thereâ€™s one on AI and machine learning. I might poke my head in that one, I am definitely not an expert there but love learning about it and what people are doing with it."
