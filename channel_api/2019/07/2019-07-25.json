    "text": "Hi Community,\nCould someone help me clarify the following? Having an issue passing the \"hutk\"  when submitting a form to HubSpot. The information in the \"hutk\" is not sent to HubSpot.\n\nThe only way we saw was to add the form in a hidden DIV or something to try to fetch the hutk identifier. Unfortunately, the resulting cookie did not contain the value (and this is a rather nasty way of course).\nHow can we fetch the Hutk? (Or is there a script we can include for ONLY the tracking cookie so that weâ€™re able to fetch the Hutk identifier).\n\nAny insight is appreciated...",
