However, we also get incomplete submissions (if someone clicks the button but has missing info, wrong email format, etc.). I can’t switch off the non-HubSpot forms because we are using this on another site also.\nCan I change something in the tracking code to collect the non-HubSpot submissions only when successfully submitted on the site?"
