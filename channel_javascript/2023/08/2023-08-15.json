    "text": "Are you looking to do this on a page hosted on HubSpot CMS? If so, there’s potentially a pretty easy way to do it using HubL — you can access the property from <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/variables#general-variables|the global >`contact`<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/variables#general-variables| object>, and use it to set a JS variable or add a meta tag with that data.\n\nHere’s an example using first name and a meta tag:\n```{% if contact.firstname is defined %}\n&lt;meta name=\"contactname\" content=\"{{ contact.firstname }}\"&gt;\n{% endif %}```\nThis can theoretically be done with any contact property, and you can grab the contents when you need them with something like :\n```contactName = document.querySelector(\"meta[name=contactname]\").getAttribute(\"content\")```\nIf you’re trying to do this on an externally-hosted site, I imagine it should be possible, but you’ll need to <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts|use the CRM API>. However, I’m afraid that’s a bit too complex for me to give you a concise example."
