    "text": "Hi everyone! I am new to this channel, I'm a data scientist at RocketX (a scale-up in Amsterdam) and in charge of the HubSpot for my company. I was referred to this slack by the HubSpot helpdesk, because I have some issues creating associations between custom objects and companies and deals in HubSpot. I am not a developer but somehow I did manage to create the custom objects and import the data into them, however, now I am stuck at associating them with companies and deals.\nI have tried it through the developer website (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/crm-custom-objects>) and I tried to run it in Postman and my Spyder IDE. The methods I 've tried give me no response or they give me a HTTP 405 or 404 not found. I know I must be doing something wrong, but I have no clue what, haha.\nIt would be amazing if there would be a developer here that would be willing to help me / teach me so i can understand this better! Thanks so much in advance!!"
