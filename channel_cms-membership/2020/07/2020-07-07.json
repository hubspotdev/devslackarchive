    "text": "Alright, running into some weird issues over here this morning. Trying to customize a client's membership login page template, which right now is the HS default (`@HubSpot/audience control/templates/login.html`). I tried creating a clone of the existing template (partial and base) for that \"theme\" (which is available via the design manager IDE search) but I get errors when I try to mimic the `import` or `get_public_url` statements saying that no assets live at `@HubSpot/audience control/...`). I'd rather not create a client-specific copy of the entire audience control theme (and I'm not sure I even could fetch that from the CLI).\n\nEDIT: Found the issue, HubSpot finder lists the theme name as `audience control` but the portal settings reference `audience_control`. Added the underscore and it works",
