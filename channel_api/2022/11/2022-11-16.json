One of them is called “Product Type”, internal name “ip__shopify__product_type”.\n\nThe app has been deleted. However, we are unable to delete this property. It has a read only definition.\n\nI’ve tried archiving via API using the v2 and v3 Properties API. I’ve also tried updating this parameter using a PATCH…using a few different keys, some of which were very creative, to no avail.\n\nThere’s no way this property just hangs out in the portal indefinitely though, right?\n\nAnyone know how we can go about getting rid of this property?"
