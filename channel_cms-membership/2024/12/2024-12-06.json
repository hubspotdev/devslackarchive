    "text": "Hi! I'm trying to build a SAML integration to access private content. I'm using AWS IAM Identity Center for testing purposes. Users can log in and after that they access content correctly, email is recognized and if I already have a contact with that email I can get all contact data. What I need to do is also to create a contact if I don't have that email in the CRM. Is that possibile? How can I do that, is there any particular attribute I can pass through SAML?",
