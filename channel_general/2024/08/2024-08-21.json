When the user fills out a letter, letters that have not passed the validation of the email field on the site are sent to the HubSpot. How can it be fixed so that letters that have not passed validation - email fields are not sent to the HubSpot?"

Is it possible to use a calculation property for this in HubSpot?\n\nAll of the below properties output as currency with the exception of `Status` which is a dropdown select with two values: Full-Time, or Part-Time.\n\nWe run a staffing firm and use HubSpot for both sales &amp; applicant tracking. Can we have a calculation property (let's call it `Combined Revenue` ) that sets itself to either one of two values. `Combined Revenue` sets itself to the value of property `Monthly Pay` ONLY if `Status` = Full-Time, or have `Combined Revenue`  set itself to the value of property `Total Hourly Pay` ONLY if `Status`  = Part-Time.",
