I'm trying to get contacts from Shopify and create them on HubSpot.\n\nIs there a way to enroll non existing contacts on HubSpot based on what's coming from the webhook ? When i create the webhook i'm asked for a unique property to match the coming record to an existing record so it can be enrolled, but as i want to create contacts, they are non existing.\n\nIs there a way to do that ? Thank you",

This might seem like a silly one but I can see your variables match up from the webhook to the text properties, email, first_name, last_name etc. but you're calling \"phone\" as \"tel_nr\"?\n\nCan you please confirm if you changed \"phone\" to \"tel_nr\" to match and if not, try changing this to see if it works for you? :slightly_smiling_face:"
