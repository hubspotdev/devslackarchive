    "text": "Hi, I’m not sure if this is the right channel, but have a question regarding automatic image resizing on HubSpot. My company is working on a new website, we’re building it with Nuxt + Storyblok and it will be hosted on Render. We add the links to images (hosted on HubSpot Files) along with width + height to Storyblok component and then render the image in Nuxt with src we get from Storyblok (URL of the image points to file in HubSpot files) and sizes. But for some reason the resizing doesn’t work - do you know what might be the cause for this? The first sentence reads: “Automatic image resizing is enabled by default for HubSpot-hosted content.” - I always assumed “HubSpot-hosted content” means images that are hosted on HubSpot. Do we need to host the website on HubSpot for it to work? It works on our current website which is hosted on HubSpot, but it doesn’t for the one in Nuxt. Any tips?\n\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/files/automatic-image-resizing-on-HubSpot-content>",
