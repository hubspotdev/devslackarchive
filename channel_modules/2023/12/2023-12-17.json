    "text": "Hi Everyone, I have a custom testimonials module that I've added touch functionality to using jquery mobile. I've attempted to add the jqm script in the module with both long form and short form require_js statements, as well in the page header, but only the long form require tag works (with v1.5.0-alpha only), and when it does it is dynamically adding content to the bottom of the page. Has anyone else run into this, or has anyone successfully included jqm in a module? Appreciate any insight!"

The challenge is that these pages (over 200), currently use various templates.\n\nIs there a way to apply the new header and footer universally to all pages within HubSpot? I've spoken to HubSpot, and they've advised me to manually add the global header/footer to each template or theme one by one.\n\nIf any of you could suggest a workaround or guide me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it!\n\nRegards,\n\nCC: <@U06AGKNS5V3>",
