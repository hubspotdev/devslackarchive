I was thinking that I could add the module name to the id of the module with hubl, but I forgot we can't use Hubl in the js portion of the module.  I could move the script into the html portion, but that seems sloppy."

If that's the case, then inserting that module name into the id wouldn't work even if we could use hubl in the js. But, then I can target all instances of the module by class without duplicating references.",
