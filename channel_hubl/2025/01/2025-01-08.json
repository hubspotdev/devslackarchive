After some googling, I found that I could use `{{ name }}`  for a value which is unique to the instance, e.g. if that same module is used twice on a page, name would be unique to each. Is this safe to use? I couldn't find a reference to it <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/reference/cms/hubl/variables|here>. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place? Or maybe  there's a different variable I should be using instead?",
