    "text": "Ok, thanks for the the answer <@UD5NW4PJ5> :slightly_smiling_face: If I were to give some feedback I think it would be very beneficial to be able to choose whether you want to notify the unregistered contacts when you are making smaller updates to pages - I imagine it can get a bit spammy. Or if when you want to \"stealth launch\" some membership pages and notify the permitted contacts through other channels at a later point.\n\nAlso, the message in the \"Update/Publish page\" prompt that says the registration emails will be sent is quite easily overlooked - I accidentally sent out the registration email to a list of 8000 contacts, notifying them of my test page :sweat_smile:"
