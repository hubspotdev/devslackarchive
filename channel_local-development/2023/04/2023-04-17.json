Sorry if I have missed it already asked somewhere.\n\nMy issue is that I am running `hs watch` but if I move a file to a new directory it copies it on my HubSpot account. Is there a flag to avoid this or to remove everything from the server and replace with exactly what is on my local machine?",

But when I try to upload it to the portal I get an error from the HubSpot validation.\n\nIs there a way to disable or bypass the template validation?\nThanks\n\nEdit: I am importing Alpine js through CDN as a temporary solution, but I want to have everything bundled to avoid multiple requests on page load.",
