If I remember right, it should only be if:\n• you added a module that has JS on it, we insta refresh so the JS associated with the module can execute (incase it’s involved with rendering or osmething)\n• If you modify a module that has JS on it, a refresh should happen if you hit the back button in the top left of a modules edit form."
