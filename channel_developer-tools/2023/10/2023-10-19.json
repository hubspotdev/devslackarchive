    "text": "Hi Everyone, I have a module that I building and I need the dropdown selection to be a repeater with no entered information (the marketers are going to add what is needed in the dropdown) and have the content box (also a repeater) (image,text,cta) below switch as the new item in the dropdown list is added. I've tried multiple ways to do this and having a hard time implementing this. So if someone adds \"Buy\" &amp; \"Expense\" to the dropdown module field and it populates on the page and then adds (a new content box), which has a image, text, and cta and adds another box. How can I get the 1st title (buy) synced with the 1 content box and when someone selects the second title (expense) synced with the second content box which has different content from the 1st.  I'm not sure if there is an easy way to do this or not. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
