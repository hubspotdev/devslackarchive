    "text": "Hi <@U077BR2FVU7>,\n\nThank you for your response.\n\nWe have implemented a \"Javascript Cookie\" concept on our website pages to track the \"utm_source\" of visitors coming from Facebook or Google ads. This \"utm_source\" is then sent to the Deal creation API call and stored in a custom property called \"contact_source.\" While this logic works for some contacts, it does not consistently capture the source for all contacts coming from Facebook or Google ads.\n\nWe are using Private App concept in version 3, we are using PHP CURL call.\n\nApart from above logic, we have used the JavaScript tracking script throughout the pages of the website:\n\n&lt;!-- Start of HubSpot Embed Code --&gt;\n&lt;!-- &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" id=\"hs-script-loader\" async defer src=\"&lt;//js.hs-scripts.com/HUBID.js&gt;\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; --&gt;\n&lt;!-- End of HubSpot Embed Code --&gt;\n\nThis script serves to display the HubSpot chat option on the website and also facilitates the storage of contact source indicators (e.g., Paid social, Paid search) in the 'Original source drill-down 2' filter option. Should you require further details, please don't hesitate to ask, and we'll gladly provide additional information.\n\nYour attention to this matter is greatly appreciated, and we eagerly await your response.\n\nThank you again."
