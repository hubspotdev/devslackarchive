I tried `&lt;a href=\"{{ get_asset_url('/theme/templates/contact.html') }}\"&gt;Contact Us&lt;/a&gt;`\nBut this results in linking to the template file, rather than the published page (that was created using that template).\n\nI'm assuming there's some sort of HubL syntax that allows me to point to the published page in a way that isn't hard-coded, such that if the published page slug/url gets changed the links won't break?",
