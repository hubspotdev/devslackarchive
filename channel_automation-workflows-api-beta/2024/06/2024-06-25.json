No, the `segmentCriteria` field is now under `enrollmentCriteria.listFilterBranch`\n\nPart of the new API is that it supports different types of enrollment, where as `v3` only really supported list-based enrollment. `v4` currently supports list-based and event-based enrollment. So the `enrollmentCriteria.listFilterBranch` only shows up for flows that have list-based enrollment."
