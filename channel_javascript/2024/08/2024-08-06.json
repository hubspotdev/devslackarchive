    "text": "Thank you for the suggestion!! . I tried a different route by bundling the pdf-lib package in a serveless function to generate PDFs instantly and send them as a response. After hours of debugging, I found that the content type in a serveless function can only be `application/json`, but I needed it to be `application/pdf`. To work around this, I serialized the PDFDocument to bytes (a Uint8Array) and converted it to a string in the serverless function so I could return it as JSON. On the client side, I converted the string back to a Uint8Array and created a Blob from it. This method works well for text and numbers, but unfortunately, this method works fine for text and numbers, but when it comes to pictures and graphs in my PDFs, it’s really hit-or-miss.”"
