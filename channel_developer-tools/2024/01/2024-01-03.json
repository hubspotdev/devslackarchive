If you’re using the module in the same portal, you can right-click the module in the Design Tools file browser and select “Clone Module.” (see attached screenshot) This will give you a full copy of the module, including its theme fields. You can then move that duplicated module to wherever it needs to go.\n2. If you’re duplicating modules between accounts, you can right-click them and select to “Copy to different account” option. However, this only works for standalone modules and doesn’t work for theme modules.\n3. If you <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started|set up a local development flow> with the HubSpot CLI, you can retrieve the modules from HubSpot and edit them locally. When editing modules locally, they have a fields.json file which you can freely duplicate or copy/paste from. If you’re doing any substantial amount of HubSpot CMS development work, I strongly recommend going this route, as local development offers huge gains in functionality and efficiency — the extra time invested in getting set up will eventually be paid back in spades.",
