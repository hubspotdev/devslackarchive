May I know more about your business and the final task you’re trying to achieve for your organization so that I can create the custom objects accordingly?\n\nAlso, I would like to know what is the current HubSpot plan you’re using as there are some limitations on the number of custom objects and properties we need to create.\n\nLooking forward to the detailed scope so that I can provide you with better suggestions and solutions.\n\nyou can DM me for further discussion\n\nThank You and Best Regards."
