    "text": ":wave: Good morning, developers.  I wanted to bring your attention to two important product updates that were mentioned in developer day presentations, the ability to disable jQuery for CMS pages and our new Code Alerts tool.  We're moving these into a small beta today and we'd like to welcome you to participate.  To get your portal ungated for these updates send me a DM with the HubID and I'll get you added to the gates.\n\nRemove HubSpot’s included jQuery library from CMS pages\n\nWhat it is - This setting removes our standard jQuery library from your CMS pages which can help reduce page weight and improve page load speed.\n\nHow to use it - After turning jQuery off, pages should be tested to make sure they still look correct and have no new developer console errors in browsers. “$ is not defined” will shown in the console error log for any pages impacted.  JavaScript files from the Vast theme and clones of the Vast theme JavaScript files are most likely to experience issues.\n\n<https://app.HubSpot.com/l/settings/website/pages/all-domains/page-templates>\n\nCode Alerts\n\n<http://app.HubSpot.com/l/code-alerts>  This can also be accessed via the sprocket menu &gt; code alerts when viewing a published CMS page that you are currently authenticated to.\n\nWhat it is - an overview of CMS hosted pages, templates and modules that are using HubL functions more than the recommended times..\n\nHow to use it - This tool highlights pages that are using roughly 20 HubL function tags repeatedly in the same page, template or module.. Calling these functions more than 10 times per the page is likely to create performance issues for the website visitor.  We recommend reviewing pages and looking for more efficient ways to fetch / store returned data to be served on user interaction.  This tool includes deep linking to templates and modules where the functions were detected.  You can find more information regarding our recommended limits here: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/-temporary-slug-bc4b6f4d-e22e-497f-8e15-329e77cc8a98?hs_preview=gaETmzGD-9565893824>",
