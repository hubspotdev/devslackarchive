For upload my widget and show at CRM HubSpot i set up url to widget. When somebody use my widget i have to know \"who use it\" .  Maybe in request from CRM to my service for widget contained token or some identifier of user? Or another way for determine user ?\n2. At HubSpot exist workspace or company which contained several users?\nFor example: i bought paid account at HubSpot. I have some personal workspace (named like my company) where i will able add our agents to crm.",
