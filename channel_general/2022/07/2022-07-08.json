    "text": "Hi everyone. The problem that I have is: The client asked to be able to reorganise certain blogs which are currently chronologically organised (the first one showing in the list is the one with the latest published date). Client wants to be able to (something similar to drag and drop) organise blogs through HubSpot, but not by time, instead by priority which he determines. Below is the website url, where you can look into the Blog page and check the current situation: - <https://codescene.com/blog> Is there any possibility to implement this while using HubSpot, i.e. is something like this even integrated within HubSpot? Any ideas?",
