    "text": "Hey, I'm tyring to figure out how to build the following:\n• a multi-step HubSpot form that will show submitted data from an earlier step in a following step. \n• Current usecase is limited to showing it in text, but I can imagine the use case stretching to inputs (i.e. prepopulation) as well. Example:\n    ◦ In step 1, you submit a type of service and a city that you need the service in\n    ◦ In step 2, it says \"So you're looking for &lt;service&gt; in &lt;city&gt;\" in the body text above form fields\n• It doesn't have to actually store the intermittent data in HubSpot, but should carry it along to the next step. \nI don't see native functionality in HubSpot for this, but would love to understand if you could easily code this into HubSpot's embedded form script."
