Something like:\n\n`{% module \"form\" path=\"@HubSpot/form\" *style={[ \"border\" : { \"color\": \"#ffffff\" } ]}* %}`?\n\nI'm creating some default drag-and-drop templates and some might have a form over a background colour, in which case I'd like to set the border colours to white on that page only. I couldn't find anything in the documentation.",
