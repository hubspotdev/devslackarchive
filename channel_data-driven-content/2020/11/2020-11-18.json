    "text": "you won't be able to do it this way since hubl loads server side.\n\nYou have 2 choices here:\n1. load everything, and hide and show elements via js\n2. use serverless functions to query the hubdb and update rows\nI did do a workaround once for a client who didn't have serverless functions, and that's to create a page which has all data loaded, but has a parameter query to filter. I then make an ajax call to the page with the query in the param and upll the contents of the page over.\n\ne.g\n\n<http://www.example.com/listing|www.example.com/listing> - your page\n<http://www.example.com/all-data|www.example.com/all-data> - dump of data\n<http://www.example.com/all-data?query=xxx|www.example.com/all-data?query=xxx> - dump of all data that matches query\n\nfrom <http://www.example.com/listing|www.example.com/listing>, make an ajax call to grab the contents of <http://www.example.com/all-data?query=xxx|www.example.com/all-data?query=xxx>\n\nHad this idea whilst working with an infinite scroll page and it worked ok"
