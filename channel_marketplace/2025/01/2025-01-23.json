Developed a custom app within the developer account.\n3. Built and hosted the Calling Extensions SDK using React.\n4. Tested the demo calling app by:\n    ◦ Setting values in local storage.\n    ◦ Updating HubSpot settings to point to the local calling app.\n    ◦ Testing it successfully within HubSpot.\n5. Migrated the calling app to a cloud-hosted environment and updated HubSpot settings accordingly.\n6. Set the app for production use by running the PATCH API.\n*Issue:*\n Despite completing the above steps, the custom calling app is not visible under the call options on the contacts for HubSpot internal users.\n*Reference:*\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/api/crm/extensions/calling-sdk#using-the-calling-settings-endpoint|HubSpot Developers Guide - Calling SDK>\nLooking forward to any insights or solutions from the community!\n\n<#C2YGWHDKQ|marketplace>",
