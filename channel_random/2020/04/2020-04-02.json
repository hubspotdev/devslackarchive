However, I have seen some customers use <https://cordova.apache.org/|Cordova> and <https://ionicframework.com/|Ionic> to wrap their HTML/CSS/JS web apps which use HubSpot's <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs-beta/conversation/chat-widget-sdk|Conversations SDK> and deploy them on the iOS and Android platforms."
