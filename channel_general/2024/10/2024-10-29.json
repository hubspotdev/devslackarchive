This doesn’t capture a drawn or typed signature but does serve as an acceptance of terms, which is legally acceptable in many cases.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use a *HubSpot Quote*, which includes an “Accept” button, capturing the client’s consent and details. HubSpot Quotes provide a more formal approval option and can replace the need for tools like DocuSign in many scenarios.\n\nAnother option to do a twist to this which I've implemented before is to set up a workflow triggered upon form submission in HubSpot. Then send an email with a CTA *\"Sign\"* for the user to click."
