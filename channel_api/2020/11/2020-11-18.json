    "text": "Ok I hope this is the right place. My company has a system that we're trying to make work, but I don't know if the current API is well suited to the task or not. So I'm hoping for advice.\n\nBasically our marketing team uses HubSpot for email campaigns. We have a system that's I'm working on right now for tracking and storing KPI metrics such as abandoned carts, failed orders, people that purchased something a month ago and haven't purchased anything since, etc. We want the app to then reach out to HubSpot, add the person to the CRM if they aren't there already, and send one of these campaign emails to the person. Our contact at HubSpot suggested using custom fields and basically setting a flag on the person which is attached to a marketing campaign, but that leaves some questions such as how to remove the flag after the email has been sent, how the email gets sent in the first place etc.\n\nTaking a look through the API docs I can see that the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/marketing/marketing-emails|Marketing emails> section is still under development, and the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/marketing/transactional-emails|Transactional emails> section seems to be more for using HubSpot as an SMTP gateway which isn't what we want. So my question would be: is it possible to use the API to send a marketing email to a customer based on an active campaign?",

What you could do is create that flad as the HubSpotter suggested, but use that as the enrollment criteria in a workflow that sends the appropriate email, then have an if/then branch that checks the email was delivered/opened and clears the flag property. This would mean having multiple workflows potentially, but it is a thought."
