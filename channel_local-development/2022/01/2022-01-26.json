I moved the theme to a different portal though, and I deleted my HubSpot.config.yml file and ran `hs init` and connected it with the new portal, but now I find it is randomly resetting the HubSpot.config.yml file to the old portal when I'm watching / fetching... Anyone know anything about this? It's quite annoying and could suck if I'm not paying attention.",
