I’m building a site that has a listing of products, then on the product pages all of the products have tables that need to be displayed giving specs on the products The table structure and values/headers can vary product to product.\n\nI want to make it easy for the marketers to create these tables - and they will need to be responsive.\n\nWhat route do you think is the best route to go for this?\n\nCustom module that is basically a table builder - they create headings and cells in rows and columns.\n\nOR force them to use a rich text-editor allowing them to use the rich text editor to create the tables but possibly losing some control like which items are headers and stuff like that?"

    "text": "<!here> Hi all. We have some exciting news about HubSpot’s Marketplace and the new Design Manager. We’ve just made a number of HubSpot’s modules available within the Marketplace for you to add to any portal, and develop on top of. Included in the list of available modules is the HTML Module, which you can now add back to any portal that has the new Design Manager.\n\n In the coming weeks, we’ll allow providers to submit their own custom modules to the marketplace for all HubSpot customers to use. If you’re a Marketplace provider, we’ll be reaching out to describe the new submission requirements and answer any questions you might have on submitting your own modules to the Marketplace. \n\nFeel free to refer to this blog post for more information \n<https://www.HubSpot.com/product-updates/now-live-HubSpot-modules-available-in-the-marketplace>",
