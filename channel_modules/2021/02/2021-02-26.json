    "text": "Hi <@U3T21PDBK>, the code was recycled from a filter that was similar but very different with checkboxes but worked the same with HubDB. Very scattered, I think best approach would be from scratch as the logic doesnt transfer over 1:1.\n\nI have the HubDB set up with the ID to the database, but for the 'locations__contains=1,2' I am unsure. Each individual member has a ID. I just want to mainly target the 'City' column but there is no ID on it.\n\nI have the dropdown made its just not connected",

    "text": "Hello! I'm adding a `url` field to my module with only `CONTENT` links. I'd like to know how I should populate the `default` value so that on the `design previewer` I can see a dropdown menu. Here is what I mean:\n1. When I try to edit the default link on the previewer, I can only see the URL as text. e.g.: \"buy-home\" in the first screenshot\n2. When I try to add a new link, I can see the dropdown menu as expected, in the second screenshot attached.\n*So, how can I achieve the same for the default link?*\n\nThis is what I'm doing right now:\n```{\n    \"name\": \"buttons\",\n    \"label\": \"Buttons\",\n    \"type\": \"group\",\n    \"occurrence\": {\n      \"default\": 2,\n      \"min\": 1,\n      \"max\": 3\n    },\n    \"children\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"link_url\",\n        \"label\": \"Link Url\",\n        \"required\": false,\n        \"locked\": false,\n        \"supported_types\": [ \"CONTENT\" ],\n        \"type\": \"url\",\n        \"default\": {\n          \"content_id\": null,\n          \"href\": \"\",\n          \"type\": \"CONTENT\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"link_txt\",\n        \"label\": \"Link Text\",\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"default\": \"Title\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"default\": [\n      {\n        \"link_url\": { \"href\": \"buy-home\" },\n        \"link_txt\": \"Home Purchase\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"link_url\": { \"href\": \"refinance\" },\n        \"link_txt\": \"Refinance\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }```\nThanks!!",
