    "text": "Hey all, question on the new CRM API for Deals.\n\nThe endpoint */crm/v3/objects/deals/search* at <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/deals> has a property called 'filters' you can attach to the body of the request. Filters consist of a propertyName, and operator, and a value. The operator IN is not working, however.\n\nI am attempting to find all deals associated with a list of contacts. Therefore, I'd like to do something like 'contactId IN [123,456,789]. Anyone now how to use this API correctly? Consistently getting errors",
