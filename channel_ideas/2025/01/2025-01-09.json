    "text": "Real Staging is a real need, as *HubSpot* Live <> Stage is quite disconnected from each other, even if I would love this, I don't see this happening that easily.\nâ€¢ I am still not sure why this is not there from the start, like working with many CMS in the past decade it is like `Must Have` for migrations, large re-designs \n\nQuick solutions:\n1. Can use API to migrate Page from Stage to Live\n    a. problem is that `Module ID` must be the same in both environments and the process is manual via Postman / API requests\n        i. or you do `search & replace` if they are different but again, manual process, slow, page per page\n2. The current staging is not 100% great as it is Page per Page solution\n    a. <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/website-pages/redesign-and-relaunch-your-site-with-content-staging>"
