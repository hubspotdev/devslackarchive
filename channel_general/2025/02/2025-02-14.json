When someone sends you a link and it is forced language from a url param (or you happen to click on one) this will remove that from the url, and automatically…\n\nIf you are an arc user, you could set this up as a boost, for this domain, so anytime you visit, if your language setting is incorrect, this cookie update will have been set, so just an instant refresh gets you there. You could modify this a bit and verify if the language is already set to your preferred language, and if not, set it and refresh the page.\n\nIf you aren’t an arc user, you might be able to use `Tampermonkey`  as a way to add scripts. I haven’t used it before, I did a quick google and this was on the top in a stack overflow question/answer\n\n<https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo>",
