I have a use case that I've want to solve, but I haven't find a way, so anyone up for the challenge is more than welcome :slightly_smiling_face: .\n\nContext:\nI use HubSpot as my CMS and Pardot as my CRM. So, for visitor identification and tracking I use the Pardot tracking code. Plus, for the cookie management I use a third party tool called CookieFirst. Finally I've implemented Souce Buster for tracking and UTMs retrieval.\n\nProblem:\nRecently I've found that even if the user hasn't accepted, or denies the cookies... the HS cookies + source buster get's fired. Which gives me the problem that is not GDPR compliant.\n\nTrying to solve it:\nI've tried to do a custom script in CookieFirst to block HS y SourceBuster cookies to be fired before the user confirms. But, HS cookies gets being fired.\n\nQuestion:\nDoes anyone have a custom script I can add in my HTML to block the HS cookies from being fired. I've confirmed with Customer Support and the HubSpotutk is not a mandatory cookie, so the CMS will keep on working even if I block this cookie. Nonetheless, I can't seem to be able to block it from being fired.\n\nAny suggestion is more than welcome :clap: .\nThank you all in advance.\ncc: <@U051RHP82QJ>"
