We’ve been quite preoccupied with other higher priority tasks.\n\n&gt; I also realized that it seemed basically impossible to find the page when the title is fairly short and common, I entered the exact page title and scrolled hundreds through the list before giving up on a few of them.\nIf hundreds of pages have the same title, how would you expect to refine the search? Are you asking for two search term inputs (page title and page url)?"

Are you asking for two search term inputs (page title and page url)?\nHundreds of pages shouldn’t have the same page title… It shows hundreds of results that have nothing to do with what I search… It should filter based on the page title and page URL, yes. Separately, but both. For instance, if the page title is, `Is pie really all that good?` and the URL is `<https://pie-is-good.com/i-really-like-pie>`, I should be able to search `Is pie really all that good` and see that page as a (top) result. I should also be able to search `<https://pie-is-good.com/i-really-like-pie>` or `i-really-like-pie` and also see that page as a (top) result."
