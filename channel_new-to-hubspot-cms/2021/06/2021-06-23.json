Seems like you’d have issues with content missing or being out of date on the sandbox site.\n\nIs there a best practice for developing against with live content?"

I think, at least previously, HubSpot sees the sandbox account as a place to test templates and editable fields. They want you to use \"content staging\" in the prod account to actually modify content—all \"real\" content lives in prod"
