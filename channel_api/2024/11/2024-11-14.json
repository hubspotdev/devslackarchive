These users are not Super Admins\n\u2022 My feeling is that some applications can operate by just having a Super Admin be the one that authenticates on behalf of the company (ex. Airtable), but other applications (like mine) it's more appropriate for each user to individually authenticate since they might use the extension where others at there team/company do not. \n    \u25e6 The guidance I've come across so far doesn't seem to acknowledge this difference, so hoping to hear advice that takes into consideration my playing field. That said, maybe this bullet point is just wrong and the best advice applies to both \u25e1\u0308 \n*Question:*\n\u2022 What's the norms or best practices here? \n\u2022 Is there some documentation around which scopes are commonly available to employees vs. those that would generally not be something that most would have access to?\n\u2022 If there some documentation that makes it clear what specific toggles a Super Admin must enable to ensure that the appropriate permissions are met to meet the scopes requirement?\n-----\n:zombie: Endlessly wrestling with this, particularly frustrating to navigate. Genuine appreciation for anyone that can provide any insight on the questions, or whatever you feel could help me get on solid footing. Will screenshot the scopes I currently believe are the minimum necessary to use all our functionality. Moved most to \"optional\" just to unblock users from using our baseline functionality.",
