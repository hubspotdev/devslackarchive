    "text": "Hello all! :speaker:FYI- There has been an update to the active install requirement for app certification. Effective *today*, *May 15, 2024*, the minimum number of active installs required for achieving app certification increased from *6 to 60*. This change is designed to enhance the quality and credibility of the apps available to our users. The change will apply to all new submissions moving forward, and existing certified apps that do not meet the new requirement of *60 active installs will be granted* *a one-year remediation period*.
