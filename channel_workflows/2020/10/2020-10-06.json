I would like to know if there is a way to include in an email within a quote-base workflow, a link with a token coming form the quote?\nSomething like <https://app.HubSpot.com/quotes/{{> quote.id }} or <https://app.HubSpot.com/quotes/>{{ personalization_token('quote.hs_object_id', 'quote') }}.\nI would like to automatically send quote reminders (without the input of the sales member) when the quote has not been paid. (Our quotes are linked to stripe and include a payment CTA)."
