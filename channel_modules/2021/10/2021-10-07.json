This morning I'm finding myself struggling with setting a default for a module snippet used inside of a template.\n\nI'm looking at the documentation on this page (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/en/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/using-modules-in-templates>) and I'm failing to grasp how it would work for a grouped parameter.\n\nSay the module has a field like this `module.color_theme.background_image_options` how would you set that in a theme? (Note, this module was built before Styles were available, so this is just a standard module field group with a choice field inside of it)\n\nMy attempts this morning had me with code that looked like this  `{% module \"uniqueid\" path=\"the/correct/path\", label=\"a great label\", background_image_options=\"solid_color\" %}` but that didn't seem to do the trick. I also tried calling it as  `color_theme.background_image_options` but again no dice.\n\nI'm sure this is something silly simple and I'm just a few cups of coffee short of solving this. lol But any assistance would be greatly appreciated. :smile:",

Then key the background off of that classname <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/templates/drag-and-drop-areas/sections#section-classes> Those color options could be kept in theme settings."
