    "text": "Hi folks, I’m having a relatively simple but awkward problem with UI Extension CRM card names/titles. Our use case is that we’d like a similar card to appear in the tab, sidebar, and/or preview columns, which seems to require three separate descriptor json files, each with their own title. (We do have a different design for the tab location to take advantage of the width, but it has the same content). In a perfect world, these would all have the same title, so it appears consistently in the UI at each location — however this is not allowed by the upload validator. Any workaround? Either multiple locations in one card descriptor json, or allowing duplicate titles, or having the title that appears in the settings be different from the title that appears in the column would solve the problem for us — or perhaps something else I haven’t read about.",
