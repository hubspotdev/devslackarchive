We have it with another provider integrated into our website, the screenshot of the example is attached.\n\nTo do so, our team of developers will take care of the full process, but the code provided to us is not enough to do it. Is there a chance someone could provide us with the full code that will enable this requirement?\n\nThanks in advance.",
