    "text": "Thanks for your detailed reply Carter :slightly_smiling_face: May I just ask how to get the property that I can see in your screenshot?That means, what basic info do I need to select from the dropdown (does it make a difference)? What kind of property do I need to create (single-line, calculation etc)? Also, I double-checked with HubSpot support and the support agent told me that this kind of property (with a calculation) would not be checked in terms of whether the entered number is correct or not so to prevent spam bots from submitting the form."
