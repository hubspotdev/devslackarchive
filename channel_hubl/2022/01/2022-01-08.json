PascalCase? I haven't found really any useful resources for existing macros, which is kind of surprising.",

    "text": "Can someone explain the difference between objects and dictionaries and dicts to me? From what I understood from reading the docs, a dictionary, or dict, is essentially just what HubL calls \"objects.\" But then I'm confused when the docs constantly switch between the term object in some places and dictionary in others and dict in others. And then on the new quotes variables page, it almost entirely uses the term object, but then here defines it as a dict type (<https://cdn.vizality.com/u/gPq3SFQf3s.png>) and here it references \"another dict object\" <https://cdn.vizality.com/u/Wqi3Pyc2As.png> <https://cdn.vizality.com/u/INhE4CqZW2.png> Are these just inconsistencies in the docs and you should just think of it as object = dictionary = dict, or is there some deeper meaning? <https://cdn.vizality.com/u/oxG55G4zSL.png>",

Dict(short for Dictionary) and object are used interchangeably in their documentation and the surrounding communities usage.\n\nDictionary is really a more specific term.\n\nI agree that inconsistency is potentially confusing, that said the term object is more immediately understood too for JS devs where  the term object is commonly used even though dictionary is also correct."

    "text": "Yeah, I 1000% prefer the term object, simply because I've been JavaScript for over a decade and it's much more familiar. The term dictionary feels odd to me as well, but I've been trying to change my mindset to \"dictionaries\" since that seems to be what you guys have settled on, it's just a bit confusing when I then see object referenced constantly. But thanks for the clarification that they're 100% the same thing. I definitely think whichever you guys go with, consistency is what's important."
