    "text": "I may be missing something, but, is there a way to translate a form? Or do you have to create an entirely new form? :thinking_face:\n\nI know you can change the language settings for forms. But if you want a version in english and another in spanish, you have to have two separate ones, right? Seems like there should be a way to say if it’s this url: <http://mx.domain.com/contact-us|mx.domain.com/contact-us> then use the spanish translation. If it’s <http://us.domain.com/contact-us|us.domain.com/contact-us>, then it would default to the one in english. I don’t know how this would effect analytics, but it sure would make things easier.",

    "text": "Hi <@UDW3NP3EX>, I had the same question the other day and it turns out we sort of can create translations of the original form (<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/articles/kcs_article/forms/create-forms-in-multiple-languages>). The downside is that it clones the original and creates a new one with the translated fields, so changes in the original don't propagate to the translations and after that \"create translation\" step they become totally independent forms. Maybe that's something to come in next updates (I hope at least...)"
