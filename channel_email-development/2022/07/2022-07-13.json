    "text": "Hello! I have a doubt. In the email design module, can we set up a design for desktop and another for mobile? The problem I have is that when I create a block with two columns, in mobile it first shows the left column and below it the content of the right column and sometimes it looks wrong because it first puts the text and below it the image. I would like to be able to edit different content blocks for desktop than for mobile. Thanks :blush:",
