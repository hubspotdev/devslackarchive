    "text": "Hey gang! Quick question â€” *has anyone hooked up HubDB to a calendar view*? Have a project where we need a monthly calendar view for events where events then click through to the registration page.\n\nIf so, would love to see an example. We may need to refer this one out based on our capacity, so would be a direct connection with the client. Have looked at just hooking into <https://fullcalendar.io/>, but figured if someone else has already done it, that would be way more efficient :smile:"
