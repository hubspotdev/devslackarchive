    "text": "Hey <@UEC65BQV8>, so a coded file isn't currently able to be swapped, even with the new beta, however, adding the `dnd_area` like you said makes into a coded file with DND area, which would be the end result of this new beta. You're right that we have 3 categories of templates right now: DND templates, coded files, and coded files with dnd areas and it's a little strange how hard the lines are between them (especially considering that all it takes to go from coded file -&gt; coded file with DND area is the addition of that `dnd_area` tag), but we're definitely pushing everyone towards using coded files with DND areas as it provides the best page editing experience"
