We have a number of HubSpot employees in SF. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nInternally, we've been dreaming of the idea of a headless-CMS ... would be exciting for the developers. :slightly_smiling_face: For now we have a pretty solid front-end and building more and more of the API/flexibility for devs each day.\n\nFor dynamic content, you'll want to dive deep into <#C22PDRW72|data-driven-content>. Would be interesting to post your feedback in that channel too as some of the HubSpot product team is in there looking for feedback/ideas."
