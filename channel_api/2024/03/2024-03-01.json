What I want to achieve is to pull all tickets created or updated today and sync them to my local DB every day.\n\nThe number of tickets we have on HubSpot is large, and trying to pull all tickets daily is not sustainable. I prefer a situation whereby I can pull all and sync the tickets created or updated per day at the end of that day to my local DB. How can I limit the returned data by the date created or the date updated?\n\nThe referenced API is GET /crm-objects/v1/objects/tickets/paged\n\n\n<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/tickets/get-all-tickets>",
