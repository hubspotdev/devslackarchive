    "text": "Hey guys, is there any way to *disable editing global partial*?\n\nI’m building a global header for a client that has multiple websites on the same domain. I want to have a single module with a couple of pickers where end user picks only company, and the header is adjusted (logo, menu, CTA, etc.).\n\nMy issue is that I created a global partial but it can be edited by end user on the global level and when I choose an image in the module, it seems to be overwritten by globally selected image. I can’t manage to avoid that so I though of maybe disabling editing global partial.",
