I did something similar with the office locations but am not sure what to reference for the subscriptions types.\n\nmy module code I used for the office locations is:\n{% if site_settings.office_location_name is string_containing \"REGIONAL\" %}\ntext for regional\n  {% elif site_settings.office_location_name is string_containing \"NATIONAL\" %}\n\ttext for national\n{% else %}\n\n{% endif %}\n\nhoping I can use the same or be shown a better way :slightly_smiling_face:"
