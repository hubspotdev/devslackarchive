How do you actually test it with the password protection?\nSigning in with a password won’t add to the `contact.isLoggedIn`  <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/features/serverless-functions/reference#context-object-keys|parameter>, so <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-event-registration/blob/master/src/event.functions/membership.js#L21|this if statement> in HubSpot’s own `cms-event-registration` demo will return “User is not authenticated”.\n\nI’m right now sitting with this exact issue, not being able to grab data from the CRM API with the contacts id, since this information is not accessible in the sandbox."
