We are trying to have each blog post list which blog it is coming from (name or public_title). I have done quite a bit of trial and error with hubl, javascript, and very little api work. I feel like there should be a way to display the blog name or the URL (absolute, not analytic url) of the post. Any ideas or suggestions would be helpful.",
