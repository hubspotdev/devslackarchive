The id's were c+p into the database from an excel csv and some of them had new line characters at the end of them.\nWould have been more clear for me if the error was something like \"Can't find product\" or something but I got there."

    "text": "Hello, its first time I am writing here and I am new to HubSpot, so bear with me, but I would like to get some guidance here and/or get some answers on questions I have.\n\nTL;DR Need help implementing newsletter functionality in HubSpot.\n\nI have a customer who needs simple GDPR compliant newsletter functionality on their website we building. I have found <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/marketing-api/subscriptions-preferences> which looks like something I should use for this use case. From endpoints I can see that its new endpoints (v3), so I found old ones as well <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/email/email_subscriptions_overview>.\n\n1. So my first question which one I should be using for production?\n My issue with new one is that I see from openapi spec that its in Developer_preview status. Calling one of the endpoints (v3) to get status with none existing emails it shows that these emails are subscribed. Not sure if its a bug or intended.\n\n2. My other question is, should I call contact endpoint first to create contact before subscribing? Or I can use subscribe endpoint with email only?\n\n3. Maybe there are some guides online I could take a look for simple usecases like this in regards to subscription apis?",
