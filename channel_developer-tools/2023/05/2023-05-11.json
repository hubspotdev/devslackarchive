    "text": "Hi everyone! I'm hoping to see if there's any way to send an authentication header with my Public App's webhook requests?\nThis is important as we can't rely solely on HubSpot's OAuth &amp; the webhook validation process (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/webhooks/validating-requests#validate-requests-using-the-v1-request-signature|explained here>) to process webhook requests due to our internal IT guidelines. We just need to send an { Authorization: Bearer ____ } header to make sure the webhook can make it into our backend system.\n\nAny ideas or guidance on this? Thanks very much!"
