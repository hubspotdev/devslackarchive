    "text": "Hi there. I’ve got a question I can’t find an answer to, or the answer is just that this is not possible with HS-CMS…\n\nIn planning a transition from our current website infrastructure (WordPress) to a new infrastructure and/or CMS, we need to be able to plan a migration path for our software licensing and download system. For a period of time, we would need the ability to accept a get request to the server at our custom domain (e.g. <http://example.com|example.com> possibly hosted with HubSpot) and at a minimum respond to that request with a static response; or ideally process a few variables from that get request and have a simple response to that request based on what file our customers need...\n\nHere is an example of a request:\n\n<https://example.com/?pu_request_plugin={plugin-slug}&amp;pu_plugin_api={user-api}&amp;pue_active_version={testing-install-version}&amp;pu_checking_for_updates=1&amp;site_domain={domainofuserwithoutprotocol}>\n\nResponding to that type of get request with a dynamic or even static JSON object response would allow us to transition people from getting updates at our main website that is managed by a new CMS/HubSpot to managed at subdomain that we manage. Over time the requests to the main domain for this purpose would tail off to zero.\n\nCan anyone help me know what we can do in that situation?",
