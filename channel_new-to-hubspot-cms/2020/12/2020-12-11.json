    "text": "hi all! a question, currently we are helping a client that uses the <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Email-Preferences-Pages-for-Multiple-Domains/idi-p/32702|Preferente Groups BETA> functionality to handle Subscription Types by brand/domain, the challenge is that since contacts can be shared between all the brands now they want to run a campaign to collect visitor’s consent to receive communication so for that they want to have a Landing Page where all the Subscription Types get listed by Brand and visitors can choose what type of communication want to receive and from what brand, at the beginning we was trying with a form connected to a workflow but this has the limitation that if a user previously has opted-out from some or all the types a workflow can’t opt-in again so this solution would be useful only once - the first time that user came to the page; another option that we are trying now is using the <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/account/how-do-i-turn-on-gdpr-functionality-in-my-HubSpot-account|GDPR field> but the limitation with this is that you only can use only one GDRP field so if we add all the Subscription Types to it looks like a huge list but we can’t distinguish by brand,  someone have a good idea ?"
