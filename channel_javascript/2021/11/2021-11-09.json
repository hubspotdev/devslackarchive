Two possibilities come to mind:\n\n1) AJAX - send a request to the blog listing page, then parse the markup to get the data you need\n2) Blog Post API - will give you the data you want, but you’ll need to work out how you want to handle authentication"

    "text": "<@U02LU2TBX44>\n\n(AJAX) You can use in your React App Axios to fetching the `rss.xml` data from the server (see: <https://your-blog.domain.com/rss.xml>). But feel free to use other XML parsing libraries. The bad thing is, you have to find another way to get the featured image, it's not part of the RSS-Feed. So an additional document header only request for each post-url seems required, to get the open graph meta-tag for the featured image. And also a bad thing here is, that you have a limit of blog-post entries in the rss.xml, I guess 50 posts is the maximum.\n\n(API) Hosting an extra API Endpoint for the HubSpot Blog-API mess things up here. Sounds a bit heretic to say that, but WordPress has a JavaScript API, and it's perfectly made for apps like React, especially if you use WordPress only as a backend for editors and do all your frontend with React."
