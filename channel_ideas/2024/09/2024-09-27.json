    "text": "In regards to UI Extensions, `actions.onCrmPropertyUpdate()` should either:\n\n1. Accept an optional object ID of some kind to track when a specific associated object is modified. (e.g. It triggers when a property is modified through `CrmPropertyList`, but not when a change is triggered through `CrmAssociatedPropertyList` components.)\n2. There should be an accompanying function that allows consuming developers to trigger a callback when a property is modified through the latter.\nWithout having this function, there is no efficient method of performing validation or acquiring updated property values of associated objects. runServerless could be used, but without an onChange, onBlur, etc. it would require pinging which involves unnecessary http calls, api credits, etc."
