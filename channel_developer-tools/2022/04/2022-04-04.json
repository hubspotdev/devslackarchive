The only thing I've got working is this live template file for autocompletion... but for highlighting and other features says:\n\n<https://github.com/SylvainTirreau/HubSpot-cms-JetBrains>\n\n1) to create my own Syntax highlighting - but since I am new to HubL I'm not sure how I should configure it - suerly there is a config file somewhere out there I can use?\n2) to activate Jinja - but I don't see any such options and I assume that's because Jinja is in Python?",

I've been using JetBrains for 6 years now and really not keen to make a switch I'm just 100% comfortable with it and have several of my own customisations and workflows I've built up over time using PHPStorm. The main issue is I've started a new job which is a HubSpot specialist company so I will be working with HubSpot full time, so it's important that I get this setup nicely."
