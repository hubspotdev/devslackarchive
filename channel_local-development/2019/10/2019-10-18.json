    "text": ":wave: - Happy Friday!\n\nJust wanted let everyone know that we just released a new version (1.0.0) of the CLI that has some improved error checking. The code for the NPM packages also is now *open source*! See <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-cms-tools>. We also have added a webpack plugin that makes it pretty straightforward to configure webpack to automatically upload built files to HubSpot, which together with `webpack --watch` provides a good dev experience. See <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@HubSpot/webpack-cms-plugins>. Moving forward we’re going to leverage <https://semver.org/> for versioning.\n\nRun `npm install -g @HubSpot/cms-cli@latest` to update your version and get access to these new features!"
