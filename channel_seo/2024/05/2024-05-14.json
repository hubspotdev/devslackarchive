    "text": "Thanks for sharing this <@U03AKL6Q1B2>\nJust sign up for the event. This topic has been bothering me a lot recently. I'm most curious about how people deal with HubSpot JS that worsens the speed test. Like what are the techniques for that. I understand how to control my part of the code and content (hello images), but when it comes to cookie banner, chat, and other files that come from hsappstatic or HubSpot domains, they are a mystery to me right now\n\nIf anyone here knows, please share your tips and tricks on handling that because I'm losing my mind",
