I know HubSpot has a lead score which I believe plays a role in the sales or lead assignment process. I’d like you to find out how that works, what is their lead score formula, how is it play a role if any in their lead assignment, is the lead assignment an automated process, etc.\n\n2.) What are different ways that a deal will be created? For example perhaps some are manual by sales person, some are automated? What are the automated ways?",
