Im using it in conjunction with handlebars temlates and it seems to treat handlebar’s `{{#each}}`  statments as the start of a comment that never gets closed. So it comments out all of my code after the macro.\n\nIn this case the macro isn’t needed but makes the code cleaner. But just thought that I would bring it to your attention.",
