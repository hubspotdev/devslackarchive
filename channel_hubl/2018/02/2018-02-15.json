Think Jeff or Shawn Bristow clarified it in the design manager channel previously.\n\nBascially require_css and require_js can only be used for off HubSpot files. for example if you’re using a CDN’d file. Otherwise for all HS hosted files use the linked files feature.\n\nThis means yes, you can’t conditionally load a HS based file but you can still do it with external files."
