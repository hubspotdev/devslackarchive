    "text": "It’s effectively a way for teams to communicate whether a page is ready for publishing or still needs work.\n\nIf you save as draft, meaning it isn’t ready to publish. It will appear in staged draft. If you publish to staging, it will save it in staged proof.\n\nAdditionally similar to the normal CMS if something is in draft it can’t be viewed by going directly to it’s URL.\nThis is handy for solutions partners that may be building out parts of a site or doing a redesign, and want to send a link to the end-customer to review. That way they’ll only see pages that your team designated as ready to go."

We know there are folks who’ve created LMSs on CMS Hub."
