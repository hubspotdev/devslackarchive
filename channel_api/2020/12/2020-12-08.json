    "text": "Hi all,\nCan someone tell me if there is a way to use Page Publishing API to create draft pages in Content Staging? My client wants to migrate about 500 WP pages &amp; custom post types to HubSpot, so I was hoping to write an automation tool, but so far my documentation-digging yielded only a possibility of creating a draft page in the primary domain - no way to assign that page to a temporary subdomain, no way to create it directly in content staging ... Is there something I'm missing, or HubSpot just doesn't allow that functionality (hopefully yet?)?\n\nThey already have a lot of pages on HubSpot, they just wanted to add the missing ones they have on their old WP site and then scrap it.\n\nBtw. I would be fine with using some hackish, undocumented way, since it's supposed to be just one-off thing, it doesn't matter if it will break in three months :wink:\n\nThanks a lot!"
