Under settings &gt; pages it looks as though you can edit the header/footer and add a file, but it doesn’t do anything. All I need to do is tweak it a little bit to be able to use it the way we want to. Right now it’s just too limited in comparison to our previous knowledge base tool. However, we would like to be able to use the HubSpot Knowledge Base for tracking/ticket purposes. Any tips?",
