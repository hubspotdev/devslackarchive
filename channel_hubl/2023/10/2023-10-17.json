    "text": "Yes <@U04AQA0QM8E>, you're right. I think I'll settle for a custom property with the right formatting. Actually, talking with my PM, he said that he would need a prop with a bunch of deal props to show (probably crafted with some backend integration), so I created a multi line text prop for testing with this JSON structure\n```{\n  \"module\": [\n    { \"label\": \"AMOUNT\", \"value\": \"1.234,56\" },\n    { \"label\": \"TAEG\", \"value\": \"6%\" }\n  ]\n}```\n and read it from the email custom module like this\n```{% set test = contact.test_multi_line_text | fromjson %}\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  {% for item in test.module %}\n  &lt;li&gt;{{ item.label }}: {{ item.value }}&lt;/li&gt;\n  {% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;```\nIt works!\n\nPS: I still have the programmable email option enabled, I guess it is required in order to use _fromjson_ filter on the prop, right?\nThank you."

    "text": "Hey Louis, I think I understand what you're asking. Unfortunately, HubSpot redirect to thank you page is faster than the forms API (used to pass data to the record). So, you run into a racing issue where you want some value displayed on the thank you page but it hasn't been written to the record and available to use on the thank you page yet. You'll have to use some other method to pass a value to the thank you page. Example, you can create a custom form (not w/in HubSpot), form submits to forms API, then the redirect to thank you has the input value passed as a URL parameter.\n\nHope that helps."
