We noticed that when you reload the page with the CTA, it shows changes the label almost every time. How does the multivariate test work? Shouldn't it show the same label every time in a session/for a user? Change on reload seems really strange IMO",

I was stating that it seems to be a false positive in the recommendations. Because your images are already WebP the score is the same regardless of if the recommendation shows. The score is based on the metrics. You can have a 100 on google page speed insights but still have recommendations showing.\n\nThe recommendations are suggestions for improvements based on things they can detect in the page to help you improve the core web vitals scores, they do not themselves have point values.\n\nThe kib savings noted are likely simply taking the existing file extension and using that as the source file type and using the cumulative average Google found in % improvement for png to webp and jpg to webp. If they actually tried to convert the image it likely would error because the image is in WebP format its just using the original files extension."
