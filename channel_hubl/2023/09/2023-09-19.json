    "text": "Hi Everyone! I think I have a bit of a silly and hopefully really easy question. I'm working on a custom email module to display products from my HubSpot product library. I have a custom drop-down property for Products called Product Category (product_category). I'm trying to reference that property in my module; in this case, I only want to show products whose category is \"Category 1.\" Everything's working well, except for the fact that HubSpot insists on telling me that product.product_category isn't a field that exists on my product objects. Has anyone else run into this before, and am I just making a newbie mistake in my code?\n\n```&lt;!-- Custom Email Module --&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;Featured Products&lt;/h2&gt;\n  {% set product_count = 100 %}\n  {% set product_category = \"Category 1\" %}\n  {% set products = crm_objects(\"product\",\"limit=\"~product_count,\"product.product_category.value==\"~product_category,\"id,price,createdate,name,description,product_category\") %}\n  {% for product in products.results %}\n      &lt;div class=\"product\"&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"{{ product.image_url }}\" width=\"170\" alt=\"{{ product.name }}\"&gt;\n        &lt;h3&gt;{{ product.name }}&lt;/h3&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;{{ product.description }}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;{{ product.product_category }}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"{{ product.url }}\"&gt;View Product&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n  {% endfor %}\n&lt;/div&gt;```",
