Further more, you can cant forward secure secure requests to non-secure destinations, meaning you can't forward an https request for your apex domain to the http version of the www domain. The only solution is to separately secure your root domain and forward traffic, securely, to the www domain. <http://Easyredir.com|Easyredir.com> is the easiest solution I've found for this - but others probably exist."
