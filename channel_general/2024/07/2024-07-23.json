We've had several large clients tell use that our SPF records and DNS keys are not matching up within our email headers, which is HubSpot's responsibility since our records point back to theirs. Has anyone else noticed serious deliverability issues? Another issue popped up this morning and we were advised that it's a email header issue which HubSpot tags while being delivered. It's frustrating because its 100% out of our control.\n\nAny insight would be great appreciated!"

I am posting as I am looking to develop an app for my company to launch our UI inside HubSpot and send data back to HubSpot quote line items based on interactions inside our UI.

Both are possible for us but, I am unsure what may be the best path to do what we need and if anyone has experience with integrating external software UI’s inside hub spot before.",
