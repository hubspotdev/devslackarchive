    "text": "<@UAYBXDG4U> I will give feedback regarding the documentation in a list as I have a few:\n\n1. Although TypeScript works fine, it's not clear from the documentation how to implement it. The only mention of it is in the API reference under module fields and briefly touched upon in the main README.md. There are 2 TS configurations in the GQL and Islands projects, but they are not explained anywhere. A TS integration addition to the API reference doc would help, especially to understand how to handle imports and the ?island parameter which often throws a TS error.\n2. As George mentioned, it's not immediately clear what the relationship between projects and themes is, especially since projects can also handle CRM extensions. There should be a simple architecture diagram showing that JS modules and partials are to be imported in standard HubL templates, similar to how the rest of HubSpot's building blocks are explained in normal documentation.\n3. There should be a mention that JS modules cannot be imported into JS partials. Since this can be done in HubL, it feels unnatural not being able to do so.\n4. There's no mention that I'm aware of anywhere whether it's possible to make API calls client-side with a library like React-Query or SWR. I've only tested GraphQL queries but they can only be used to fetch data from my understanding. I would like to be able to POST data to HubSpot or other tools from a form for example.\nThere are other things that I've noticed but I'll share them as I come across them again :slightly_smiling_face:"
