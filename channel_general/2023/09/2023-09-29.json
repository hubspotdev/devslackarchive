    "text": "To integrate HubSpot with a data connector, you'll typically need the following information:\n\n1. Client ID: The Client ID is a unique identifier for your HubSpot app. To obtain the Client ID, you need to create an app in the HubSpot Developer Dashboard. If you haven't created an app yet, follow these steps:\n\n   - Go to the HubSpot Developer Dashboard (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/apps>).\n   - Click on \"Create App\" to start creating a new app.\n   - Provide the necessary details for your app, such as the name, description, and other required information.\n   - Once you've completed the app creation process, you should be able to find the Client ID in the app's settings.\n\n2. Client Secret: The Client Secret is a confidential key used for secure authentication with HubSpot's OAuth 2.0. After creating your app in the HubSpot Developer Dashboard, you should be able to find the Client Secret in the app's settings, alongside the Client ID.\n\n3. Refresh Token: The Refresh Token is used to obtain new access tokens when the current ones expire. To obtain a Refresh Token, you need to go through the OAuth 2.0 authorization process. This involves having the user authorize your app to access their HubSpot account. The authorization process will return a Refresh Token along with an initial Access Token. You can use the Refresh Token to obtain new Access Tokens as needed.\n\n4. API Key (HAPIkey): The API Key, also known as the HAPIkey, is an authentication token used for API access. It's different from the OAuth 2.0 tokens mentioned above. To obtain an API Key, follow these steps:\n\n   - Log in to your HubSpot account.\n   - Navigate to \"Settings\" &gt; \"Integrations\" &gt; \"API Key\".\n   - Click on \"Create key\" to generate a new API Key.\n\nOnce you have obtained the Client ID, Client Secret, Refresh Token, and API Key, you can use them in your data connector integration to authenticate and interact with the HubSpot API."
