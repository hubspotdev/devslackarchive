But still appreciate additional info on how icon tag and icon field work especially in terms of the theme. Currently, working on the module for a theme and it looks I’m not getting it right for now :smile:\n\nThanks!",

You'll need to republish CSS files to see the effect take action (adding a space and publishing should be enough, or if you send me pages you're seeing issues on I can take care of it).

The easiest way to get the icon values at the moment would be to use the module editor in the Design manager, then use the copy json button to get the values - if you’re working locally.\n\nThat way you can pick the icon using UI.\n\nWe realize that’s not ideal and aim to make it easier to do fully locally but it is not a quick fix."
