I’m new here, apologies if this is not the place for this question!\n\nIs there any way to take…\n\n```{% text \"preview_text\" label=\"\", value=\"\", no_wrapper=True %}```\nAnd use <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/filters|filters> like `|urlencode` or `|upper` on it? I’m able to use filters on `{{ content.subject }}`, so I figured that since the subject line and preview text are so similar their usage and purpose, that they’d be able to be manipulated in the same away."
