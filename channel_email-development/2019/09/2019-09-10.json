I've created an email template in the Design Manager, but it is not coming through as responsive to non-desktop email clients, even though I did set it up like that in the settings. How could I either remove some items from mobile clients or format them so it doesn't look so rubbish :poop:  (will add screenshots in thread)",

Ideally, I'd get rid of those boxes at the top on mobile devices if that's possible. I'm not sure how to do that though!"
