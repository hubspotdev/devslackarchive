(first screenshot)\n\nIf you want a breadcrumb here it should be for the placement of the module, e.g. contents&gt;section&gt;column&gt;module name (though this isn’t necessary just as none of the other parts have a bread crumb e.g. Add to page, Optimise etc)\n\nThere should be a seperate module breadcrumb below smart rules which only lists the groups you’re in within your module having to navigate above the module title is not intuitive and a bad UX further the inclusion of “contents” means the breadcrumb regularly has to be elipsissed.\n\nThe design manager makes it so much more simple (second screenshot)",
