    "text": "Hi All,  we are trying to automate the creation of a marketing event with an associated dynamic list with filtered branches, I can create the marketing event, and I can created a dynamic list with the filtered branches, however, to associate these objects I need access to the record id of the marketing event. If I manually go through creating the filter for the dynamic list through the web application it is able to select the record id automatically, however I do not see a way to access the record id of the marketing event through the Api, nor is it (the record id) returned upon creation of the marketing event through the Api.\nI was wondering if i am missing something to access the record id of the marketing event through the api or if that is not possible with the current version. \"filterBranch\": {\n            \"filterBranchType\": \"OR\",\n            \"filterBranches\": [\n                {\n                    \"filterBranchType\": \"AND\",\n                    \"filterBranches\": [\n                        {\n                            \"filters\": [\n                                {\n                                    \"property\": \"hs_marketing_event\",\n                                    \"operation\": {\n                                        \"operator\": \"IS_EQUAL_TO\",\n                                        \"includeObjectsWithNoValueSet\": *false*,\n                                        \"values\": [\n                                            \"[exteranal app id]-0-54-[ Marketing Event Record ID]\"\n                                        ],\n                                        \"operationType\": \"MULTISTRING\"\n                                    },\n                                    \"filterType\": \"PROPERTY\"\n                                }\n                            ],\n                            \"eventTypeId\": \"\",\n                            \"operator\": \"HAS_COMPLETED\",\n                            \"filterBranchType\": \"UNIFIED_EVENTS\",\n                            \"filterBranchOperator\": \"AND\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n        }",
