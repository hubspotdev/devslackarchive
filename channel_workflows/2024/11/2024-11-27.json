    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI'm experiencing a recurring issue with one of my workflows: I have enabled the setting *\"Allow contacts to re-enroll after completing the workflow\"*, but I still see this error in the activity log: _\"Object not enrolled because it is already enrolled in the workflow.\"_\nThis happens even though I expect the contacts to re-enroll after completing their previous workflow session.\nSome details about my setup:\n1. The workflow has not delays\n2. I've tried creating a custom property to track the contact's status in the workflow, but the problem is that I can't update this property if the contact doesn't re-enroll into the workflow due to the error\n3. I have already enabled *\"Allow contacts to re-enroll after completing the workflow\"*, but I still keep getting this message.\nAny advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",
