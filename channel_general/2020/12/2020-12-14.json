    "text": "Hey there, I think there was a misunderstanding potentially in the communication.\n\nLet me help clarify.\n\nCMS Hub Enterprise has serverless functions. We currently support nodejs in serverless functions.\n\nWe have a few different methods of storing data within HubSpot. HubDB a more table like database. Custom Objects a datastore that enables you to draw associations between your company’s CRM data and custom types of information. We also have the blog, and pages with modules. Which can store your website data.\n\nHubSpot is a SaaS CMS, it is not a general server webhosting platform.\n\nThere are a lot of advantages to the CMS as a result of this. Security is managed by HubSpot. HubSpot does a ton of performance optimization, DDOS protection, has a built-in CDN with image resizing and automatic conversion to webp. The CMS is directly integrated with the CRM so your marketing/sales data can power and optimize your CMS Hub website. We have the CLI which enables a continuous integration and deployment workflow and local development.\n\nAlso you don’t have to update the CMS, it is always on the latest version."
