    "text": "Curious to know what everyone's go-to stack is for HS development. I was running Gulp tasks for a time but found it was buggy and unreliable, so I migrated to Webpack and have had much better luck. Biggest issue now is how long it takes to pack my sites and deploy the `dist` but otherwise I'm pleased. Working with:\n\n• TailwindCSS + PostCSS for proper nesting\n• TypeScript for my `main` and dependencies like jQuery, JS carousel, Lodash, Select2, etc.\n• Minify plugins and general linting via ESLint\nTrying to keep it light, but I'm wondering what others are doing to improve their HS development process.",
