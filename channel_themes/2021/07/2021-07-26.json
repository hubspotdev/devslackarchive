Upon receiving feedback from <@U02094DEMTK> (thanks dude!) on some items to fix, I'm suddenly seeing some very bizarre  warnings and errors that were not there prior to submission.  Specifically these two in the screenshots.\n\nAnyone else experiencing odd things like this or know what these could be caused by?",
