I'm not sure what happened and why would we suddenly loose access to this endpoint (couldn't find any explanation in the HubSpot API docs or anywhere on the internet ) :thinkonk: Ah, the funny thing is that we're still able to fetch the list memberships with the V3 api :slightly_smiling_face: Any help would be appreciated!",
