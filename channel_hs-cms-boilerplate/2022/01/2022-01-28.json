    "text": "Yeah :sweat_smile: I think we have been running into it on both ends (e.g. `{% set example = 'I don\\'t love this' %}`). In the case above it technically works because the HubL will be successfully run first. We did tweak the style guide to say that it makes sense to use single quotes in HubL depending on the situation. Do you think it would make more sense for your specific example to follow `rel=\"{{ rel|join(' ') }}\"` so it is easier on the eye/less scary?"

Concatting seems to be the safest option 100% of the time though."
