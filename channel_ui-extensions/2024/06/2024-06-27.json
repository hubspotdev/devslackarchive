    "text": "Thanks so much Simone that is helpful context! I checked and unfortunately, it is not possible to add a link to the `addAlert`. Only text is allowed in there.\n\nI hear your point about wanting to provide feedback once an action is done. One potential idea: the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/ui-components/modal|Modal component> could be used as a way to show that a task was successful. This will need the user to explicitly open the Modal but I'm wondering if this might be helpful? I'd love to chat more and it might be good to set up a call to discuss your use case in depth and discuss your feedback. Here's a <https://www.HubSpot.com/meetings/aanchal-sheth/11-meeting-link?uuid=61bf94eb-29cb-4b33-b622-ea9863464bf8|meeting link>"

Is that what you're asking?\n\nCan you tell me more about your use case? An example would help us think through options and see if we can do anything on our end"

Right now we have to use a workaround to display the % over the budget with a tag, but it would be a lot better if we could show the 132% directly within the ProgressBar."
