Where I am populating HubSpot fields with my calculated values.\n\nWhen I set the value of each field with javascript it appears to be functioning fine. However upon submission my populated field values aren't being submitted and go through as blank.\n\nI am using the form field rather than the JS embed code, however I don't think this would be the reason for this not working. I have checked the values on submission of the form and they come back as empty.",
