It wasn’t something that was for publishing to the marketplace, but rather an app that is unique to an org. Does anyone remember that presentation? It may have been at Inbound from last year…",

We develop for Shopify and our customers are Shopify merchants.\n\nDoes anyone sync their Shopify install data to HubSpot? It would be good to have merchant data automatically pulled into HubSpot for marketing emails - it looks like most of the Shopify + HubSpot integrations are for the merchant (getting consumer data into HubSpot), not the developer. Anyone have any luck with this?",
