If you are using a flex column and do “add module” form the content tab (to not deal with the ui issues) then the search defaults to all modules instead of the themes one. This UI is preferred over the add, I believe.  I think it is also missing clone module which would be great. Maybe I’m just using it wrong?"

For the module names thing, are the module names truncated? If so, we should have a fix out somewhat soon that atleast shows you a tooltip showing the full name."
