Say  GET`/crm/v3/objects/companies`  to fetch companies records, can anyone help us out to fetch only recent updated/added company data? As we connected with Support but they routed us here to get exact solution to most recent company data added/updated. We are following this <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/companies#retrieve-companies|page> for retrieving company object records.\n\nThanks in advance, let me know if we need to add more detailing to the above request?",

You may not always receive answers to your questions right away, but there are a few things you can do. 1) Search Slack before you ask your question - someone may have asked it before and gotten help and 2) start answering some questions before or after asking yours. See if you can assist, and folks may be more likely to help you out."
