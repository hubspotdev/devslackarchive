    "text": "I am trying to get the latest meeting (engagement) details (more than the default contact properties provide) for a particular contact (via email). This seems more convoluted to do with the API than it should be. From what I can tell you need to use the following:\n\n• GET: `/contacts/v1/contact/email/:contact_email/profile` =&gt; return a contact object id (`:objectId`)\n• GET: `/crm-associations/v1/associations/:objectId/HubSpot_DEFINED/9`\nAt this point I have a list of engagements for a particular contact... but thats all the engagements - so in order to find out what the correct engagement is (for the latest meeting) I would need to loop through each engagement ID and get its information too. *This A) seems borderline insane, B) would take a ton of requests just to something that should be more accessible.*\n\nAm I missing a more sensible API endpoint here? This can't be the only way to get this information,"
