You can give the support team a call and they'd be happy to help walk you through how to do this.\n\nLastly, I found a number of knowledge articles that may help: <https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3AHubSpot.com+lead+rotation&amp;oq=site%3AHubSpot.com+lead+rotation&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.5002j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8>"
