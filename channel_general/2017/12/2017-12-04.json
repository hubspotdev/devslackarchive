    "text": "Hello everybody. Ads Add on tool was not working for the client, bcz all other interaction and activities were handled by clients website forms that were all custom coded to Salesforce. We couldn't replace the forms with HubSpot to solve the issue in a standard approach, so what we did was custom integrated a field that reads the UTM code off of website visitor  into a text field between the website to Salesforce and from Salesforce to HubSpot. Now my question is in HubSpot side, how can we associate that UTM string one more time with ads add on so that the next stages of customer journey on that ad is automatically  updated. ?"
