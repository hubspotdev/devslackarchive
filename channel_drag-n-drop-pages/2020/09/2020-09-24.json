    "text": "<@UKHNRHVC7> <@U8THBCFC4> I am not sure if this is a similar issue. But I am trying to swap a legacy page that used template builder with a theme template that uses a flexible column. But when I swap the template in content staging all of the module references are gone and the content. I tried to include the same module types because they are the HubSpot default kind (rich text, form) I also gave the flexible column the same name as what was used in the legacy template. Is there a way to get this to work without starting from scratch and copying pasting content over? Maybe a migration step (you are migrating to a theme template. Would you like us to copy over your existing modules and content [yes, no]) thank you"
