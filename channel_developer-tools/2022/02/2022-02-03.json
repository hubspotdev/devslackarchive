I’m having some troubles trying to add external CSS to my HubL template.\nI would like to use something like _`&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"<https://discover.darwinex.com/hubfs/Darwinex_MKT_local/darwinexMKT/delete/TDC-L01.css>\"/&gt;` _for CSS hosted in Files instead of `{{require_css(get_asset_url(\"../../../css/landings/TDC-L01.css\")) }}` hosted in Design Tools, but It does not work… Does someone know how could I use external CSS here? Thanks!",

    "text": "You can do that, you just wouldn’t use `get_asset_url()`.\n\nUse `require_css` alone.  <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/functions#require-css>\n\nFor better performance though I’d recommend uploading those files to HubSpot and loading them like your example instead of an external host.\n\nThanks to a browser security change generic CDNs don’t get the performance benefit they used to. It used to be if you loaded a file from a CDN - say jQuery for example. Every site that loaded that specific copy of jQuery at that URL, benefited because once that file was cached in the browser, if another site called that same file, it would be returned from cache instead of loaded from the server.\n\nThat’s not the case anymore. Browsers now store a separate copy of that external CDN’d asset for every Top level domain that calls it. Meaning you don’t get the network caching effect at all anymore."
