    "text": "Hi everyone I've got a question about certification.\nI started two courses: HubSpot CMS Developer and the HubSpot CMS Developer II: Best practices about a year ago because we need to build a website in HubSpot CMS.\nI didn't finish it, just enough to get the site built. This week I picked up the courses again. I could go through them quickly since there was not much left and I've built a couple of websites with HubSpot CMS after the first one.\n\nThe question:\nI've just submitted the practicum for HubSpot CMS Developer.  Should I wait for the grade result of this one before submitting the practicum for HubSpot CMS Developer II or is it just better to create a separate developer account for this one?"
