We’d like to two-way sync that info to HubSpot CRM, in order to use SalesHub and MarketingHub. \n\nThe question is:\n\n1) What plan we need in order to sync (two-way) “Contact info” between HubSpot and AWS (or any other 3rd party platform) basic ?\n\n2) Reading HubSpot documentation says “The API allows for two means of authentication, OAth and via API. Using Oath 2.0, per link [1] below, seem to require Professional plan? Using API, link [2] below, says “Applies to all plans, that means we can do two-way sync with the Free plan?\n\n3) Also interested in syncing Products (described in link [3] below). What HubSpot plan is required? \n\n3b) Is is possible for products to create a custom field for Picture? If so, would HubSpot has a way to send to AWS S3?\n\nThanks in advance for any help. If something needs further clarification please just let me know.\n\n[1] <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/initiate-oauth-integration#scopes,%C2%A0>\n[2] <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/Integrations/How-do-I-get-my-HubSpot-API-key?_ga=2.250797440.787510528.1618505379-307363244.1618505379>\n[3] <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/deals/how-do-i-use-products>",
