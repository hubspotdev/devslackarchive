Was working on this throughout yesterday and just got back to it a few minutes ago. Some of the larger structural changes done alongside the Prettier 3 upgrade are having some side effects. Will update *soon with more info on timing of release."

Suddenly, a voice spoke to her saying “You cannot escape.” Her heart sank as she realized the worst had come to pass. She had entered dependency hell. She threw her computer into the fire and recited the incantation to keep the demons at bay. “Are em, dash are eff… slash!”_\n\n_Barely escaping with her life, she never looked at the black magic book of JavaScript again. She now casts her spells with a powerful Elixir and rests easy knowing that the portal to NPM is forever closed… or is it?!_\n\n_---_\n\nAnyway, good luck with the upgrades."
