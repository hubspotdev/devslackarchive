It could return things like:\n- Page link\n- Page Title\n- Page Feat Image\n- Page Meta Desc\nThis could then use a parameter like related posts where you can use a Macro to have it loop through it all or just pull stuff together.\n\nUse case: I am creating a resources page and it will list pages/posts that people can reference. I can create a listing of the posts using the related blog posts tag and the posts override param, but the pages are little more manual"
