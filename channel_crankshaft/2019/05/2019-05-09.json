Seriously that is awesome, and your work is very much appreciated. The 2 front runner logos are both awesome and take into account feedback and ideas pulled from the other logos. The way I see it, none of the work was wasted, some aspect of another person’s design and community feedback got incorporated in some way into the more final versions of the logos.\n\nAs Ike said, the logo is a banner to rally under but it’s not what will make the framework a framework, there is a ton of opportunity to contribute through code, and documentation.\n\nI plan to try to document everyone who contributed a logo in some way, and everyone who voted in the poll, so credit will be given to everyone."
