    "text": "<@U05Q2R4ESCA> I'm from Mperativ. We are very excited about the List API. We are already using the Export API to sync HubSpot CRM data to the Mperativ platform. With regards to the List API, is there a way to not only retrieve the list membership, but also the date the member was added to the list? Also, if a dynamic list is associated to a campaign, can we pull the campaign name too. Based on documentation, it doesn't look like we can do this, but thought I'd ask in the hopes that there are undocumented features. :-)",
