    "text": "Happy Friday everyone :wave:  - we are starting to use GitHub projects to increase visibility on what we are working on in boilerplate (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/projects>). A new project board will be created before we start work on each new version/release of boilerplate. For v1.2 of boilerplate we'll be focusing on updating boilerplate to meet the requirements in our new style guide (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md>) so that our code is consistent and easier to read and so that boilerplate is more consistent with HubSpot's default themes (<https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/building-blocks/themes/default-themes>). Please let us know if you have any thoughts or feedback on how we can be more transparent about what we are working on and as always, please continue to provide feedback in the boilerplate repo or in this channel.",

Thank you again to <@U3T21PDBK> for your polyFill suggestion. We'll be working on a new project board for version 1.3 and will reach back out for feedback and suggestions once we get started on that. Have a great weekend everyone :wave:"
