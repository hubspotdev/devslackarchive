    "text": "Hi team, question:\n\nIs there a way to conditionally add modules to a dynamic page? Dynamic pages are generated by the information that comes from the hubdb table, I wonder if there is a way to render X module on X generated page.\n\nI understand that I could add a column in the hubdb table where the content creator, using a boolean, could select which page to render the module on, but the problem I see is that it should also have columns so that the content creator can fill that module with information.\n\nIs there a simpler way that I don’t know of to do this?",
