    "text": "Hey guys, after a little experimentation, it would seem as if the issue stemmed from reserved words. Upon changing the HUBL variable name 'type' to 'carousel_type' , The issue had disappeared and the variable now returns the expected default value.\n\nI'm unsure if this is the full truth as HubSpot usually tells you if you can't use a specific word for the variable name. Ex. type 'label' in the variable name and it will show an error.  So it would be great if someone could confirm that 'type' is indeed a reserved word.\n\nPlus there was also the fact that the field still worked (with 'type' as a variable name) if in the content editor, when building a page, a user would make a selection in the field, but then this may simply be a case of overriding the reserved word's value, possibly. Honestly this is all speculation at the moment but regardless. I think I'll be avoiding the variable name 'type' from now on ^^b"
