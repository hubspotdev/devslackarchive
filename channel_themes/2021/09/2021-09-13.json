    "text": "Hi Jacob,\nI have the same problem. I've created a custom button and with the style fields I've given the horizontal alignment setting it to the center by default.\nThen in a landing I needed the button but set to the left, so I did as you set horizontal_alignment=\"LEFT\" and in fact the button went to the left as I wanted but I realized that, in page, I lose the settings of the alignment of my module. For example if in page I want to reset the alignment to the center, this does not move and remains on the left"
