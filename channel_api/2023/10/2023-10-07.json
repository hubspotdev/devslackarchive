    "text": "Hey there,\n\nI want to track CPA from our funnel in our SaaS Tool. When a user registers for our tool, a new contact + deal are created in HubSpot via the API. However, I would also need to track the UTM parameters for the registration in HubSpot to see what my CPA is.\n\nIs that somehow possible via the API?\n\nI know that it is in theory possible through the tracking code. Problem is that the code is only activated on an opt-in basis.\n\nThanks in Advance!\nAndy"
