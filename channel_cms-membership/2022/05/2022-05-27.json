    "text": "You could do this a couple ways....\n1. Have two different headers and update the template to use the modified header.\n2. Modify your header with the ability to load two different logos. Then build a condition into the header to determine which logo to use. I do this often where I want a different logo to show in a sticky header than what shows on the initial page load. Or a different logo to display in a mobile menu. You can do this using javascript to add a class to the page, and then show/hide the appropriate logo based on that class. OR I've also setup header options with a page selection field... where I could select which pages on the site to apply a certain element to.\nLots of routes to go here... just whichever makes the most sense for your setup."
