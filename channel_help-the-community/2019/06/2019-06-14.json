    "text": "Hi all. Hope you can help me. We are going to build a website for our client, preferable in HS CMS. But now they also want to integrate their webshop functionality in the new site (first Idea was to refer to the external webshop from the new website). They only sell a few books. Is a check-out even an option in HubSpot? Or do you suggest to go to Wordpress CMS instead? Thanks!",
