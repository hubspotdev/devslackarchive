    "text": "Added a global module as <@U7SL518D6> said, but... i'now have 2 different blogs that use the same templates, same domain, different /folders, a la <http://blog.HubSpot.com/marketing|blog.HubSpot.com/marketing> and <http://blog.HubSpot.com/sales|blog.HubSpot.com/sales>... Now, the problem is both blogs are sharing global settings while i was hoping they would not (for example there's an accent color setting for each blog if you know what i mean)"
