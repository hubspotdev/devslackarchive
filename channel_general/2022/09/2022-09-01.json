    "text": "hi everyone! I am soon going to start developing a semi-large project. It's also going to be my first HubSpot project and I wanted to ask about your *workflows*! I am particularly interested in versioning and *GIT*. Do you guys develop locally and then upload all the changes? Do you work with git at all? What is your work process?\n\nAlso on another note, has anyone managed to work with *post CSS*? I think the nesting feature is really useful and would want to work with it more.\nThanks for all of your answers! Cheers!"
