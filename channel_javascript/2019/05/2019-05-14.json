I can detect when a user submits it via global event (see doc: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/global-form-events>).\n\nHowever, I was planning of processing the data submitted by users with `onFormSubmit` because the doc seems to show that the data is transfered with the event.\n\nBut sadly, no matter what I try, all global event return an empty `data` object.\n\nCould it be because I'm not using jquery in my app?"
