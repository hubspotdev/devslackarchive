    "text": "Hi! Is there some hidden wisdom for the optimisation complaint of having more than one h1 tag? I've understood that this should not be an issue for eg. Google at least if the markup is otherwise semantically sane. For example, we have another h1 but it's in a `aside` tag in context where it makes sense semantically. We'll change that to h2 now but that's just to get rid of the warning which might look alerting to content producers, but I'd like to know if the reason is eg. that Bing does not know how to process semantic elements.",

    "text": "Hi Vesa,\n\nAn `&lt;aside&gt;`  does not reset the heading ordering like the spec states in most browsers (since last I checked). So by having multiple h1's you would be hurting users using assistive technology as it would make it a little harder/more confusing to navigate the page.\n\nThis has to do with how browsers interpret the H1 to be like a page title.\n\nSEO wise yes, Google can detect which h1 is likely the one you intend based on AI and by analyzing multiple of your pages and understanding which parts repeat. One way you are relying on Google to “figure it out” the other way you are just telling Google straight out.\n\nGenerally with SEO communicating more information and in a format that is blatant and obvious is usually better."
