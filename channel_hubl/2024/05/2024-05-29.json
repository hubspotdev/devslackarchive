    "text": "Possibly a silly question, but... I'm trying to grab specific objects from the \"product\" object based on a list dynamically pulled sku's from a hubdb table, but I've hit a wall. I thought I'd be able to plug multiple hs_sku's into the query params, but I guess crm_objects doesn't work like that... I know I could use crm_object and iterate over my dict of sku's, but it has a hard limit of 10 calls per page according to the docs, and I need to grab more products than that... I considered grabbing everything and then filtering what I needed out, but that would definitely be heavy on the front-end as that's quite a bit of data.\n\nIdeally I'd like to keep this to HubL as I'm really trying to avoid using serverless functions for this project, so if HubL won't cut it, I'll be looking at creating a custom app... which is more work than I wanted to do, but I will if I have to.\n\nAny suggestions or ideas?",
