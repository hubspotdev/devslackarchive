I tried going down that road as well, and nothing really fits with such a complex use case.\nSo I went with having multiple collections in my listing query, for each country, and then have a query for each type (webinar, ebooks, etc).\nIdeally I would be able to use my proposed country selection, but not being able to add multiple child tables defeated this purpose."
