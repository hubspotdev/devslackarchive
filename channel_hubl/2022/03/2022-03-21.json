If the user is in [list B], show content B. Else if the user is not in either list, play content C. This would be for pages where 80% of the content is displayed ‘as is’ to all visitors, and just 20% of the elements on the page are dynamic and need to identify the user before determining what to render.\n\nIt seems like maybe there’s a way: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/website-pages/create-and-manage-smart-content-rules>"
