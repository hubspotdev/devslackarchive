He used HubSpot and paid a flat fee for some basic customization, but he doesn't like it and would like to do more. I've looked at the code for the blog template that HubSpot made and it is convoluted and confusing to me, so i'm trying to help the client find someone with some expertise to work this out for him. If anyone is interested let me know. Thanks!",
