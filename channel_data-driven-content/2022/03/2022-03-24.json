I’ve got a project where the client wants to have filtering options (text and select inputs at the top of the page) that would show results based on the selections made. Anyone have an idea on how such a system would work? Is there a way to use POST or GET values in a HUBL module? Is there another way to do it, given that there’s a limit of 10 queries to HUBDB on a page?"

There should be 2 companies on the contact I'm checking, but it only pulls the primary one (and if I change which one is primary, it pulls the other one). I could do this with a serverless function, but if possible I'd rather use HubL.",
