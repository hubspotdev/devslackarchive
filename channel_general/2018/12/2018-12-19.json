For example, I have a site that will be regionalized (translated) for Pakistan, but the content will be in English. do i choose English and wind up having the URL as /en/en-pk, which I really do not like the redundancy, or choose Urdu for the language and put my content in English anyhow, …..? How have others solved this?\n\nI don’t want to start experimenting, because I see that you can’t remove a translation once it’s started (which is a huge problem as well)."
