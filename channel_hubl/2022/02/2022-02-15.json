So there really isnâ€™t an operator for it in hubl but you can combine the expression tests to check for it.\n\n`is containing`  is one expression and then you can throw the `not`  in there to negate it. There are actually a bunch of pretty slick expression tests that are worth taking a peek at in the docs here\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/operators-and-expression-tests>"
