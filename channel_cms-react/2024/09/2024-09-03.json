Im finding difficulties in deciding what to use and whats available.\n\nI have my first batches of posts loaded from a graphql query, but then I want to be able to filter by tag without reloading my page.\n\nI cannot pass a parameter that way with graphql and if I want to use the rest api, I need to create a private app, or a serverless function to not expose my token in the react app.\n\nIs there an easier way? I way to get my public posts in an api that doesn’t need authentication and that I can filter, similar to the hubdb api?",
