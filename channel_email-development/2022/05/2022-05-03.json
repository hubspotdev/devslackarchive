    "text": "(Similar question to what you asked <@UU4T3609E>)\n\nI am sending “Event invite” emails to existing contacts via a `sequence` and, in the email, am including an “acknowledge” URL link that we want the contact to click if they plan on attending.  The link sends them to a “thank you” landing page (hosted in HubSpot) that does not have a form, as they are already in HubSpot and we don’t want them to re-fill a form.\n\nWhen testing with a “clean” browser session (no existing HS cookies, no content blocking), HS captures that the contact clicked the link, but it does not register that the contact viewed the landing page. (I’m testing this way with the assumption that some people may not have persistent cookies.)\n\nWhat am I missing or doing wrong?",
