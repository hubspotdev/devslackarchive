    "text": "Hello,\nNot sure if this is the right channel for this query but Iâ€™m currently collecting responses for seminar using HubSpot forms.\nI would like to identify which survey forms have high satisfaction ratings. Is there a good way to do this?\n\nIs it possible to compare the number of responses for specific items across different forms? I understand that while HubsSpot reports show the total number of submissions, they do not display the aggregation for each item within the form.\n\nFor items that are consistently asked, like satisfaction, my understanding is that if the same contact submits another response, the property is overwritten each time.",
