Now, I have searched the HubSpot API and it doesn't mention Listings anywhere.\n\nAlso tried: `api_client.crm.listings.get_all()` which usually works for companies, contacts, etc. but doesn't work for listings. Has anyone worked with listings via API?\n\nAny help much appreciated!",

I hope I'm missing something obvious, but when I make a call to Deals to return the property for \"pipeline\", in my example: <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/deals/123456789?properties=pipeline>\nI have \"default\" returned as the value. However, in the system, if I go to report builder, I see the same deal with \"xx Sales Pipeline\"\nWhat am I missing and how do I get \"xx Sales Pipeline\" returned with my call rather than \"default\"?\n\nUpdate: It seems like it has something to do with labeling. It seems \"xx Sales Pipeline\" is what the default pipeline name is, but how can I return that value when making the call? I sincerely appreciate any help on this!\n\nUpdate 2:\"crm/v3/pipelines/deals\" was exactly what I needed, just posting here in case someone else finds this helpful!",
