    "text": "Hi everyone!\nI’m creating the application which main use case will be import/export contacts. I’ve already done with importing contacts using search endpoint, but I can’t find the way to get the associated company information as well like domain or company names for contacts. Can someone help me please?\nWhat I exporting is this property set\n    “properties”: [\n        “email”,\n        “hs_lead_status”,\n        “firstname”,\n        “lastname”,\n        “company”,\n        “website”,\n        “associatedcompanyid”,\n        “jobtitle”,\n        “hs_additional_emails”,\n        “HubSpot_owner_id”\n    ],\nBut looks like “website” and “company” fields are not the same as associated company domain and name.\nThanks and have a good day!"
