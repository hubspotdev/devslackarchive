I'm contemplating either forcing the iframes with some `!important` css brutality or attaching a MutationObserver to the things and then forcing the height attributes all over again after HubSpot is done with them :zany_face:\n\nE. OK so I did some testing and it appears the meeting calendars before the last one are rendered a bit taller, maybe to separate them from each other, which is handy I guess, except when it isn't"
