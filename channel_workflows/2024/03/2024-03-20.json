Its a scheduled workflow on deals that should read some data from Google Big Query and store it to some custom fields. Does anyone have experience with the googleapis library? I try to figure out how to authenticate my google service user and perform a query to a table in big query.",

I want that form submission to send an internal email with personalization tokens of all of the information submitted in the form. When I submit a test I don’t receive the email notification. I suspect maybe the issue is that there is no contact associated with the submission. Would that cause the workflow to not trigger? Is there an alternate approach I should be taking? Any help is much appreciated!",
