    "text": "there are some workarounds needed to get  file manager files to work with the local hubl server. for one, when referencing local files they need to be prefixed with `/file_manager/path/to/file`. they also need to be within the folder specified by `templateBaseDir` in your `config.yaml`. So the directory structure is a little inconsistent with the structure you see in FTP (local hubl server changes don't always keep up well with changes to other tools)"
