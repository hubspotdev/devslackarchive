We've added in a few additional selectors to the wrapping `&lt;div&gt;`s around form inputs. So now, the wrapper around the input has the following set of selectors: `hs-[internalPropertyName]`, `hs-fieldtype-[formFieldType]`, `field` and `hs-form-field` (those last two were already present. Additionally, there's one included with underscores that looks like this: `hs_[internalPropertyName]`, this is only present for backwards compatibility with older instances of Forms, we'd recommend ignoring that one."
