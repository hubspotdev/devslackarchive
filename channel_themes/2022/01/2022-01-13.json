Clone the marketplace theme (not a child theme), and the only way to actually do this know is to open a module which then give you the prompt. Can't right click the theme anymore\n2. Then right click the module in the *cloned* theme and 'Move' to the *child* theme\n3. Then *delete* the cloned theme",
