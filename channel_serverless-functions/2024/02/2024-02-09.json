    "text": "Hi there, I try to use the HubSpot project to build a crm card with the ui extension, I followed this <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/create-ui-extensions|tuto>. The deployment works nicely but when I try to make some modifications et test it with hs project dev  I have an error that saying this :\n```[WARNING] Unable to determine if your extension entry point is calling HubSpot.extend, this may prevent it from rendering as expected\n[INFO] Serving app functions locally\n[INFO] Running extension 'Example Card' from app 'Get started App'\n[INFO] Browser connected and listening for bundle updates\n[ERROR] App function failed to callback within 15.00 seconds.\n[WARNING] [ERROR] testFunction```\nSo I understand that the front (in react) can't communicate with the serverless-functions (used as backend) when I click on a button that use the serverless function\n\nIf someone could help me with this, I would be very nice !\n\nThanks by advance",

The reason it is timing out is probably related to those changes.  The serverless functions used to take a callback, so it is probably waiting for that callback to be invoked, which doesn't happen.\n\nIf you run `npm install -g @HubSpot/cli@latest` to install the latest version of the cli and then run the project locally using `hs project dev` does that seem to resolve the issue?"
