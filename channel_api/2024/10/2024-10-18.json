Hope you are all geared up for the weekend.\n\nYes we have worked in the similar niche.\n\nOne approach could be to customize the HubSpot form to include hidden fields that capture the logged-in user's email from the Salesforce portal. We can also use Salesforce's APIs to fetch the user's information and populate the form dynamically.\n\nHave you tried this and not being successful? I would like to discuss this further and get your feedback. Sending you a DM."

It's sort of like the functionality of the native integration app but for custom objects.\nI'm wondering if HubSpot has a place where I can deploy/host the app?\nThe docs on \"custom code\" and \"serverless functions\" aren't clear about just having a non UI general program the runs periodically... let alone something not implemented using node.js\nDo I need an external hosting solution like postman or AWS?\nThanks all.",
