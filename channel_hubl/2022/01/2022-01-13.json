The unique slugs are the values I need - not the labels that are returned by default.\n\nFor example in the screenshot attached the 1st column (labels) is what's being returned by default. I am hoping to access the column circled in blue which contains the internal values.\n\nI've tried accessing these through dot notation as one would expect but with no success.",
