    "text": "Anyone at HubSpot looking into this bug? Another thing I noticed is that if you create a page with a template that already includes a module with an attached CSS file (tested with require_css), that file is loaded correctly from the child theme. But if you drag-and-drop the same module from the left sidebar it will add the CSS again for the new module, but from the parent theme instead. This only happens if you add this module in the page editor before the existing template module. Please see the screenshots for a simple example with a Test module that has a test.css file attached with require_css(get_asset_url('...')). The issue might be with get_asset_url(), but that's just a guess.",

    "text": "Hi guys,\n \nIn a custom module, what should I do to hide/disable the CENTER option for the \"type\": \"alignment\" field in fields.json file?\n \nMeaning I'd like to see the LEFT and RIGHT option only.\n \nI looked around for a hidden subfield but couldn't find any. I assume it should be something like that:\n \n```{\n  \"label\": \"Position Image\",\n  \"name\": \"img_position\",\n  \"type\": \"alignment\",\n  \"alignment_direction\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n  \"visibility\": {\n    \"hidden_subfields\": {\n      \"???\": true\n    }\n  },\n  \"default\": {\n    \"horizontal_align\": \"LEFT\"\n  }\n}```\nAny ideas?",
