    "text": "Very hacky and this is a simplified version of what I did:\nMake the field hidden in the form settings, then use css/js to show the label and container again (but don’t unhide the field)\nThen append this line which creates a date field with just the native browser date picker\n```&lt;input type=\"date\" required pattern=\"\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\" placeholder=\"yyyy-mm-dd\"&gt;```\n(the pattern and placeholder is for ie that doesn’t support date fields and requires the format yyyy-mm-dd modern browsers will have a datepicker in the users browser format)\n\nthen run some js on change event to update the hidden field value with the new field value.\n\nI guess you may be able to just show the hidden field and change the attributes then you won’t have to do the on change js"
