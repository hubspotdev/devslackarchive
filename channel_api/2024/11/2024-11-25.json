This custom form submission didn't include an IP address. This could affect your form analytics.\n2. The cookie needed to link form submissions to existing contacts isn't being sent. You'll need to ask your developer to update the integration for this form.\nIs there any way to resolve this errors? As we are loosing analytics after using API.",
