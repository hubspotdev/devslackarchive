So each user has different access token and each user can perform these operations using his own access token.\nHowever, with these scopes, only super admin users can complete the OAuth process. When a non-super admin user attempts it, they receive an error stating that they don’t have the required permissions.\nI’ve already tried granting all available permissions to the non-super admin user, but the issue persists.\nMy assumption is that only super admin users can access HubSpot APIs.
