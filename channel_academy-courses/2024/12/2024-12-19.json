I believe I’m getting the fields (like text, image, etc.) that I’ve created in the modules, and I need to reference them in the JSON file. However, I’m wondering if there’s any additional setup required for working with JSON—like specifying a path in the CSS main file or something like that?\nI know these might sound like simple or silly questions, but I’d really appreciate any guidance you can provide from the start.\nI hope my queries make sense!"
