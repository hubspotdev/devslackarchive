    "text": "Hi all, I have reached out to HS about this and they don’t have a solution so I thought I’d try here.\n\nI am trying to create a workflow that works with call activities recorded against the contact record. The problem that I am facing right now is that I would like the enrollment criteria to check the “latest activity” instead “Any Activity”. The downside to using Any Activity is that when there have been 10 outbound calls since an inbound call was recorded then this contact still matches.\n\nIf I have to use this Any Activity enrollment criteria if fields have been updated in the last 1 days. Is there a custom action or another way to isolate if the latest activity record and set 3 properties (listed below) on the contact record?\n\n1. Last Twilio call timestamp - Date\n2. Last Twilio call direction - Inbound or Outbound\n3. Last Twilio call outcome - matches Call activity outcome\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",

    "text": "So with custom code, what you can try is this… \n\nI tried similar for a client I had to enroll about 10k records. Nightmare\n\n• Export your list, literally add a column with values 1-1000.  Let’s call it ‘count_number’\n• Import/update the contacts so ‘count_number’ is filled in for them\n• Create another property ‘Run_count_number’. Make it a single select. \n• In your WF, the one with the issue at the moment, at the end, add a 1 minute delay with the delay action\n• In the same workflow, add ‘run_count_number’ is true to the enrolment options\n• Then add a custom code action as the last action, after the 1 minute delay that will do the following\n• - The code will take the ‘count_number’ of the current record and add 1 to it i.e. 1 + 1 = 2\n• - it will use the search API to look for the record which has ‘count_number’ 2. It should get only one record\n• - the code will update the ‘run_count_number’ of the existing record to ‘false’ and then\n• - The code will set the value of ‘run_contact_number’ on the record with 2 as ‘count_number’ to ‘true’ \n• When you’re done with the WFs, start the run by setting the value of ‘run_count_number’ to true for the record with ‘count_number’ = 1 \nIdea is a domino/cascade effect, when the record with ‘count_number’ 1 is done with the API, it will delay for 1 minute and then call the next record to visit the API. They will call each other till they finish. Since we are delaying for 1 minute, I’m guessing at least 3-4 hours for the WF. I left mine overnight to run. It was annoying seeing records enrol one after the other but it was sweet to see how the records called the next. Like classmates calling the next person to the principals office. :smile:\n\nI think this work for your case as well. "
