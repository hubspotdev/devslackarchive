However, it gives a CORS issue when I try to preview the template.\n\"Access to fetch at '&lt;my api&gt;' from origin '<https://preview.hs-sites.com>' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.\"\n\nAny idea how can I get this running in preview mode?",
