    "text": "Might not be too sophisticated, but you can have a workflow trigger when the number of associated objects is &gt;1, if it would work for you to have a workflow make your actions. Not sure if that would work for your use case.\n\nAlternatively could you have it so the button makes your actions, updates a rudimentary property on success, and then use onCRMPropertiesUpdate for that?\n\nOr can you make 2 actions in your serverless file? I have some component buttons that when clicked, make 2 back to back API calls. Sorry if i'm not fully understanding your use case"

We will try to at least document it better.\n\nCRM action components do not support call back at the moment. I will send your feedback to the relevant team. Thank you."

    "text": "Thanks <@U06H94JKK1P>, unfortunately, even using a workflow, the card won't update because `onCrmPropertiesUpdate` only triggers when a change is made to the UI. And I'm using the prebuilt (by HubSpot) CRM Action Component to associate the custom object, so there is no serverless file. It's a great prebuilt component, but there are limitations, as <@U03FJQPSC0Y> mentioned.\nThanks, <@U03FJQPSC0Y>. Please let me know if/when anything comes of this. I can think of numerous use cases (outside of what I'm trying to implement now) where a callback would be extremely useful."
