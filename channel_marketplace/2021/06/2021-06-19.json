    "text": "A few things could have happened Stephen if you didnt previously specify dimensions for the image the image wouldnt have been resized. It would have just been converted. There is an upper limit to our automatic resizing, so if you had an enormous image we may not be able to auto resize(see the docs for exact size limit).\n\nAdditionally some testing tools dont actually look at the file returned itself. They just look at the file extension to produce recommendations for webp. The way we convert webp, it will still show the png or jpg extension in the url. It wouldnt affect the underlying score on google page speed, as those recommendations there do not affect points. They are just recommendations based on what google can detect.\n\nAs documented our automatic srcset generation isnt going to be as good as if you manually tailor the sizes and use image resize url function. This is because we cant accurately predict the true sizes the image will appear at for different screen sizes, so we impose a general default set of sizes. That said this is a great way to get performance wins in areas where developers either dont have direct control(rich text fields) or where developers dont want to take the time.\n\nAdditionally our automatic resizing isnt tailored to the individual image. If youve used image sizing tools youve seen the quality sliders. You can drop the quality substantially on some images without a noticeable difference. But if you made that same change to an image thats got a lot of color variation and complexity it could look terrible. So our automatic resizing is set up to try to strike a safe balance that will safely compress the majority of images.\n\nIf you upload a jpg or png at the perfect dimensions out right, with the proper quality setting tweaks then your image likely wouldnt be getting resized, just progressively enhanced to webp as needed. This means manually compressing is always going to be better but we're here to provide automatic compression when needed so you get the best of both worlds."
