    "text": "Hi gang, I have some questions around smart content.  \n\nI would like to set a default location for visitors and update CTAs to reference that information throughout our HubSpot website.\n\nI'm assuming the easiest way to do this is through smart CTA's and custom contact properties,  but I could not find any documentation on this, so I'm piecing together what I can on my own.\n\n1) I see we have 6 built-in properties I can use to create a smart CTA.  It is possible to create a custom contact property that can then be used to create a smart CTA?  My custom contact property is not showing in the smart CTA workflow, and I don't see any options for making it available there.\n\n2) In HUBL, I see there is a way to read the contact custom field property.  Is there a way to write to that property for a viewing user?  Perhaps via a specially-structured URL parameter?\n\nThanks in advance for pointing me in the right direction!",
