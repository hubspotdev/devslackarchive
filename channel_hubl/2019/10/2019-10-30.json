Where do I find the `menu_id`?\n\n*More context*\n- I’m trying to extract some of these values: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-variables>\n- According to the menu function I need the _“ID of the advanced menu”_: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/en/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-functions#menu>\n- This page says I need to find it under `Content Settings &gt; Advanced Menus`: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-tags#menu>\n- Where are the content settings? Well I can’t see that mentioned in the interface. Even when you navigate to <http://app.HubSpot.com/settings|app.HubSpot.com/settings> it doesn’t mention “content settings” anywhere.\n- I did some searching and found this post announcing the new content settings: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/blog/new-content-settings>\n- That wasn’t much help because it didn’t mention “content settings” anywhere in those screenshots either. In fact that article announces a new advanced menu update….\n\nDid menu_id get removed from an old “Content Settings” page that used to have a different “Advanced Menus” design? This is pretty confusing!",
