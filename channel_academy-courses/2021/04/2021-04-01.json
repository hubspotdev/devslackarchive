Irony is most of the CMS development videos are from within a year ago, we’re just moving very quickly and it takes a lot of time to get videos updated. Work is in progress.\n\nWe’re working on it. If you respond with the video you were watching and where you ran into a snag I’ll make sure to let the academy team know. I can also probably point you to the relevant developer documentation for that thing.\n\nOtherwise our developer documentation should be seen as a source of truth."
