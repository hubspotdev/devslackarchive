    "text": "Hey <@U028G1LM4F7>, I don’t think the HubSpot node API client has support for custom objects yet, so you might need to use the <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs#not-wrapped-endpoints|client methods for calling unwrapped endpoints> to manually call the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/crm-custom-objects|custom objects API> to fetch the invoice.\n\nThen to fetch the contact you can follow the <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs#example-search-contacts|example for searching a contact>.\n\nThen to associate the objects you can <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs#example-create-contact-company-and-associate-created-objects|follow the example in the docs to associate two objects> (you might need to use the unwrapped endpoint client method to manually call the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/associations|associations API> again here).\n\nHope that helps! Also, in the future, there is a <#C019VT42R8X|workflows> channel that you can ask questions about custom code actions in"
