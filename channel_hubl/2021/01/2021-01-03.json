    "text": "Hello everybody,\nI need your help about conditions.\n**As you see in the video that I have a \"boolean\" that is connected with \"choice\".\n**And \"border-radius\" choice is connected with 2 \"number\" conditions.\n**When I directly turn boolean off ( instead of selecting default value that is \"search\" ), \"number\" conditions don't disappear. Probably, \"choice\" remains as a border-radius which makes 2 \"number\" conditions appear.\n<https://share.vidyard.com/watch/6MqhC5D3pkWXF3zhKspREj>?",
