    "text": "Hey all, hoping someone can give me a hand with the problem I'm experiencing. I'm trying to get the contacts data from HubSpot using the API with Python interface. Unfortunately the standard `api_client.crm.contacts.get_all()` only yields a couple of properties, but definitely not the whole list. I know that we use a bunch of custom properties on the contacts object and I am not seeing any of them. They also fail to show when querying for a specific id via `api_client.crm.contacts.basic_api.get_by_id()` . Do I have to specify the properties I'm after beforehand? How would I do that?",
