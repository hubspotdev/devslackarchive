    "text": "hello everybody,\nIn hubl and html template, when you are creating custom module, then you call it with dnd_module path etc, you can precise a default value for a simple field for the page to render correctly.\nI know we can precise some default value inside the custom module itself but that’s not my point.\nSometimes a button module, for example, has to be in many template and has to change its background-color according to graphic design, in this case we cannot precise inside the module a default color, I need to set my default color according to my template, so inside my main page and not inside the module.\n\nI know we can do that :\n {% dnd_module path=‘/Catalogue 2020/Dependencies/Modules/Timeline step.module’, number_background=“primary” %}\n\nMy problem is about a button which is a repeater,  I can’t figure out the syntax I need to set a default value to the first occurence of this button. I can’t find anything on the documentation about that.\n\nI tried a lot of things but it’s not working :\nbutton={{0 : {cta_background=“primary”}}\n\nif someone knows that it would be amazing ! thank youuu",
