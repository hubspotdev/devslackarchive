    "text": "I hope this happens to no one else… \n\nThis is the marketing message on HubSpot’s website for the Enterprise solution. It threw us off with the second word below the tag line: “track”. \nIn reality, HubSpot Enterprise does not allow you to track pretty much anything through the additional subdomains. At least not for reporting purposes. \n\nOther than the —already included in professional— primary subdomains, you can’t use the additional subdomains to report behavioral data. You can’t use them on reports (not even with the Add-on). You can’t use them on sources. I can’t see why we would we want that. \n\nOur conclusion is two fold:\n1. Additional subdomains on the Enterprise license are just “domain redirects” to the same hosting. It is pretty much an aesthetic solution that doesn’t really provide value (Besides, adding a new subdomain forcefully means removing the “primary” condition for your current primary subdomains)\n2. The enterprise license really means just cheaper contacts.\n\nWe really want this product to do better and if there’s anyone in HubSpot who would like to hear us out, we are more than willing to provide our two cents. \n\nSo far, “Enterprise” is a much bigger name than what we perceive it is.
