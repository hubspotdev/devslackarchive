    "text": "I like the idea of a Settings tab. I usually just create an \"Options\" group by default in the Content tab for this, but a Settings tab would be more organized and clear.\n\n> Good <@U0429V78FDK> mentioned another issue concerning repeaters that needs to be addressed.\n> \n> Here’s an example. We have a custom module — a slider with numerous slides in it. Let’s say a marketer wants to style buttons separately for one slide — a green button, and another, blue one.\n> This means we will store styles for separate slides and the slide’s content in the Content tab since we can’t access styles for a single repeater from the Style tab. This pattern breaks all the consistency and expected placement for module settings.\n> \n> <@U7SL518D6> is this something could be improved or at least considered to be added to improvement roadmap?\nYeah, this is an issue I run into constantly, and I hate it. Just yesterday in fact, I had to create a \"Styles\" group in a repeater and even create my own spacing and gradient group options and stuff, since the Gradient and Spacing fields aren't even accessible in Content."
