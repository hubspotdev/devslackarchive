I couldn't create a new blog because they don't want to use the same subdomain the blog is on for these press releases. I'm using a coded template so i can have different layouts for the main listing page vs the dynamic post pages. Would pagination code need to go inside the if statement that controls the listing vs dynamic pages?",
