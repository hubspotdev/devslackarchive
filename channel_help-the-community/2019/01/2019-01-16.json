Instead of placing the content only in the post body, I want to build the whole post with many modules (like: text, single image, content slider, gallery, CTA, text box, …) just like the pages.\n\nI know that I can add the modules code by embedding code to the post body, but the modules only appear after a reload and as soon as you want to edit the post body, the module view disappears and the modules code becomes visible again.\n\nIs there a better way to load the modules into the editor? In the sidebar on the left side of the pages there is the “+” symbol to add modules, but this is missing in the blog."
