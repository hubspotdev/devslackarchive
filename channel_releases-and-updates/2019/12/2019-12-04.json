    "text": "<@U38EZFVFE> and <@U54TVT3C1> I need to correct myself. `{% include %}`  does not work with SVGs.  SVGs are syncable to the design manager as Will states but to display them you will need to use `get_asset_url()`. This will return the imageâ€™s URL to be used in an img element. It does not inline the SVG. [removed my prior messages to prevent confusion for others.]"
