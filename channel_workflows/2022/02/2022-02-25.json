Passing data from the first webhook to a second webhook isnâ€™t available yet, but that is coming soon.\n\nThis first update introduces the ability to use GET requests and allows you to store the response from a webhook as an output. So these webhook outputs could be used in actions like the data formatter, custom code, and copy property.\n\nThe next update will include the ability to customize your webhook request body, that will be where you will be able to select that first webhooks outputs.\n\nOnce this next version is ready to be released to beta I will add your portal.."
