I’m guessing your running a script to fetch custom modules, save them to json files within local Hubl server to be then used i.e  {% custom_widget …. ?\n\nif I extract say this <https://api.hubapi.com/content/api/v4/widgets/332906189/?hapikey=demo> i’ll have the ‘all-in-one’ json but then when coming to edit the modules it’ll be like v1 and i’m guessing there needs to be a setter in pushing my update of this now local module via the API no? Or how would you send these changes back up during ajax calls?\n\nSeems like you have a working solution in this, could really help others out if there was documentation on it or your example some how?"

This client organizes a lot of events (1/2 per month), and they currently communicate on them on their blog: they display the event details within a blog post, and then send the visitor to a google forms to register their subscription.\n\nI’m wondering what is the best choice to structure that in HubSpot: Keeping the same model (using a blog post for each event with a unique registration LP)? Using one landing page per event (but I’m afraid they turn crazy with the volume)? Or using Hubdb to generate dynamic events pages with a registration form?\n\nI’m a bit confused about the best solution to choose... Has anyone already worked on a similar case? What do u think? Thank you!"
