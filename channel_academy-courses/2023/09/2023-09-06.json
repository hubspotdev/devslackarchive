In my dev account I cannot select crm.schemas.custom write permission (it's not available for me). Also, I am unable to create a custom object but practicum requires creating 3 custom objects. When I got to Settings -&gt; Objects -&gt; Custom Objects it tells me that \"Custom objects go beyond standard objects like contacts and companies to give you even more flexibility. Structure your CRM to match your business and meet your needs\". Does anyone knows how can I get access to these things and complete the practicum?",
