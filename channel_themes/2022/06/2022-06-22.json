    "text": "Anyone been going *deep* with the brand inheritance stuff?\nSeemed like a great opportunity to us to take the brand colors, generate full set of shades for each color and then map these to the appropriate semantic color design tokens (through css custom props).\n\nAfter *a lot* of cursing and messing about with the limited tool that hubl is, we’ve managed to create a css file that generates a list of css custom props per brand color defined in the portal settings.\neg:\n```:root {\n    --colors-brand-1-900: #580329;\n    --colors-brand-1-800: #9d0649;\n    --colors-brand-1-700: #e10869;\n    --colors-brand-1-600: #f8388e;\n…\n    --colors-brand-1-100: #fed6e8;\n    --colors-brand-1-50: #fff5f9;\n    --colors-brand-2-900: #004d1a;\n    --colors-brand-2-800: #007627;\n…\n}```\nTo me, this feels like a use-case that would be intended? Take some color settings, use them in a css file. It’s even mentioned in the docs:\n```In a HTML/HubL or CSS file, you can use the following tokens to access the primary brand color:\n\n{{brand_settings.primaryColor}}\n{{brand_settings.colors[0]}}```\nProblem though, when adding or changing a brand color, the css file is not regenerated.\nI know this is a long shot, but are there any ways/tricks/hacks to get that css file to regenerate when brand settings change?",

Custom header and child css was not affected.\n*My bandaid fix:* \n• Cloned down the main.css and the _variables.css files. Linked them directly into the child theme base.html file. Layout, structure etc returned. Selections from fields.json did not.\n• Set the main theme to match the child theme selections. Luckily this portal only has one site and one theme. Pushed these to all assets, but still did not affect the live site. I also changed a setting in the child theme and published, and that did not affect the live site either.\n• Opened and republished each individual cms website page and landing pages (250 altogether) from the content editor. The intended edits were showing up in the content editor. \nNow my site looks like it should, but the underlying problem isn’t fixed. My humble opinion, something went off in a backend part of HS, so that it wasn’t inheriting all the parts of the child theme after the update to the original. The child theme is not available in the template selection menu, but is listed in the Theme section of website settings.\n\nI updated several websites today all using the same marketplace main theme with custom child themes. This site was the only one that went off the rails."
