But a lot of it is useless because it's stuck in the timeline and you can't really do much with that, or you have to do some fiddling with custom reports and still not get the right job.\n\nBut what you want is a way to understand and appreciate how different types of prospects (personas) interact with your media across their lifecycle. Do appreciate the trends of things they care about and when they tend to care about and then have that information inform your content strategy. You want to understand the influences of your campaigns.\n\nFor account-focused companies, you want to do this on a company level and see engagement across the company instead of just at the individual level. But HubSpot can't give you this. But Journey Manager Pro can! It will give you a way to scale they way you organise important engagement and conversion based activities across your owned media.\n<https://app.HubSpot.com/portal-recommend/l?slug=ecosystem/marketplace/apps/marketing/analytics-data/campaign-activity-manager-1088053>"
