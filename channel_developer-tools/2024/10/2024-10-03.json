    "text": "Hi, I am exploring ways to input historic bitly links into HubSpot that have not been setup with any campaign tracking. These links are recognized here and there in reporting using UTMs but are not consistent. These links/QR codes are being used for print and other various marketing materials that might be circulating for a couple years. Going forward we plan to use tracking URLs and CTAs if digital but I was curious if anyone else has experienced something similar?"

    "text": "Hello - I currently have a react application and we're trying to move our signup flow into HubSpot. Originally I was trying to build a custom module with cms-react to leverage the code we already have, but that's proven challenging with our auth dependencies. I'm now wondering what tools or options might exist for having a signup form that a) can use Google oauth, and b) integrate with Firebase.  Are there modules that exist or ways to configure a form in HubSpot to communicate with our Firebase resources when submitting?"
