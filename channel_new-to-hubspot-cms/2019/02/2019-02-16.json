    "text": "Hi :wave::skin-tone-3: <@UFEK2AS87> - Welcome to the community! ... Most HubSpot developers will create a very simple template with a global header, global footer and a flex column in the body. \n\nThen they will create lots of modules that can be drag and dropped into the flex column body. \n\nThis is based on Atomic design principles. It is more time consuming up front, however, it gives much more flexibility for updates later and will give the marketers using the website the ability to update on their own. This will save time on the long run. \n\nYou can learn more by taking the new “HubSpot CMS for Developers Certification” - <https://academy.HubSpot.com/courses/cms-for-developers>"
