    "text": "<@U7SL518D6> Thanks. I was going in the direction of grouping the body of our groups together into one group to be able to do this. The header and footer were easier to manage because they are modules already. It was really main content that is the issue as grouping them will probably break my styling a bit with the extra layer of divs., but its nothing that can't be fixed.\n\nDo you know if there are properties we can access when we embed HubSpot videos (aka Vidyard videos)? The embedded HubSpot videos are failing compliance at the moment. Thanks again for the tips and help."
