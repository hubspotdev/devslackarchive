Changing the column to numbers + 0 decimal places and no separators seems to have done the trick.\n\nAlso, the CSV export seems to be working for me again. A week or so ago it keep timing out on me (my table is quite large).\n\nThe CSV once imported works fine as Excel resists the to get clever with it."
