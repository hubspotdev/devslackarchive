You can do things like:\n• Setup workflow extensions\n• Create custom timeline events\n• Setup webhooks\n• etc\nHowever, you need to setup the app via the API, then you install the app onto your account(s). Once you successfully install it onto your account, it will have all the features you've setup on your app.\n\nThe app also acts as an events monitor. If you use Oauth2 authentication in your side to use the API, you will need to authenticate it through the app, and it will monitor all of your API calls as well.",
