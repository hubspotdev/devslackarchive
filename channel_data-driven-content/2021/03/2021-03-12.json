So all sessions are added together to the main page’s analytics. If you want track individual pages, you need check page views in Google Analytics or similar."

    "text": "Yes, you can use HubDB rows also in modules. Unfortunately your filters sound a bit complex so you might need to play with front-side javascript code. For example to convert people’s address to location code.\n\nAnd yes, you could use _boolean_ field-type in modules to give content editors a possibility to select visible filters.\n\nYour module isn’t easy to build, but it is possible. Just let me know if you need help with that."
