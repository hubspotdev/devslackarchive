    "text": "Once an app is submitted for review in the marketplace, does all work on it have to stop until the review is complete, or can we continue to work on it throughout the process? Initially, I was under the impression that it would take ~10 days for them to review it, but now I”m hearing it’s quite a bit longer. I’m just wondering if it makes sense to just submit now while we continue to finish up the project or not."
