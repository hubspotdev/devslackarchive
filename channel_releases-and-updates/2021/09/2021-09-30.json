    "text": "Hey developers!\n\nNow in BETA is the ability to assign users and teams (partitioning) to HubDB tables for CMS Enterprise customers. Similar to partitioning in other parts of the app and CMS, this allows admins to assign specific users or teams the ability to view/edit a HubDB table, allowing larger customers to effectively manage structured content in HubDB.\n\nIf you, or any of your customers want to try out this BETA functionality, please send me a DM!",
