I've got ~24K contacts that I'm trying to pull field history for using <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/lists/get_list_contacts|this \"get contacts in list\" API call>, but I can only get 100 contacts per request.  Hoping to auto-resubmit the request while the JSON results contain `\"has-more\": true`, while also automatically updating the vid-offset value for the next call from what is provided in the last set of results:\n    `\"has-more\": true,`\n    `\"vid-offset\": 82361122`"

We only use this specific form to create new contacts (with a pop-up on our front-end), so I’ve thought about migrating this feature from the Forms API to the Contacts API. However, the documentation clearly states that the Contact API is designed for offline contacts. It suggests using the Forms API for online forms, which is logical, I guess. How can we overcome this 1000 entries limit, or what other API should we use?",
