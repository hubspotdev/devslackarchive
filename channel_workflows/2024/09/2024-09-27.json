    "text": "So Ive also add a lot of issue with MS Teams webinar and HubSpot. \n\nMS webinar doesn't integrate like Zoom Webinar. It's all PowerShell. They also want you to register on their end, not HubSpot (form). \n\nSo what I did for a customer was to use <http://SimpleEvents.io|SimpleEvents.io> in front of Teams Webinar. Then setting the Webinar to allow anyone to join. \n\nBut the only way they join is via SimpleEvents and HubSpot."
