    "text": "Hi everyone :wave:,\nI've run into an issue regarding user identification on HubSpot-hosted sites. On <http://hs-sites.com|hs-sites.com>, I can differentiate between HubSpot admin users and regular membership users, using the `membership_email` variable when I'm logged in as an admin. However, on my custom domain, even as an admin, I'm redirected to the login form.\nHas anyone else faced this issue? How can I distinguish between regular users and admin users logged into HubSpot when hosted on my own domain?\nThanks in advance!\ncc <@U01QVR44MEY>",

Specifically, is there a variable or a method I can use to print their email or identify them in some way while they are in the editor?\nAny guidance or resources you can provide would be highly appreciated.\nThanks again!"
