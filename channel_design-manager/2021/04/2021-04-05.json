    "text": "Hi channel. Happy easter. How do you recommend to design a template? For example, if i have a slider module which needs a certain library, should i import this library outside or within this module? take into consideration that i'd like both my template and my custom module to be flexible for future pages. Thanks in advance for your feedback"
