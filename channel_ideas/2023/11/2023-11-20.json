    "text": "Thanks Logan, I tested again and what I assume is happening with the client is that they type something, they see the Georgia font selected even though nothing is actually applied to the elements.  So they go to the select box to look for their theme font or remove the font selection and by going to the box they then have “selected” Georgia which gets applied to the element.  I will instruct them to not select anything but I’m guessing this will continue to come up and I can’t unselect the ones that have already been applied so that’s it’s own issue."

    "text": "Ah I see, totally valid user flow. I admit this experience is not the most ideal. But yes, leaving the font-select as-is should resolve this problem.\n\nAs for removing an already-serialized font on elements, users can utilize the “remove format” toolbar button inside of the `more` menu, but that will clear _all inline styles_, not just font."
