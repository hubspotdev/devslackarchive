But when i try it that way, i get an error stating my ticket id is invalid.\nWhen i change the ticketId with the noteId, everything works as intended.\n\nI don’t know if i just don’t understand the pattern here, but i think it’s a bit counter intuitive to write it that way.",

On 12 of October `2022-10-12T14:56:07.293Z` I’ve made a request and got 404 response for an email I’m confident that did exist in HubSpot crm as lead, I don’t think I was rate limited at that point as I only guard against 404 error code, in case of rate limit the app would simply raise an error\n```client.crm.contacts.basicApi.getById(\n      email,\n      undefined,\n      undefined,\n      undefined,\n      false,\n      \"email\"\n    );```\nAlso prior to that request I’ve made one extra call to your search Api at `2022-10-12T14:56:06.694Z`\n```client.crm.objects.meetings.searchApi.doSearch({\n      filterGroups: [\n        {\n          filters: [\n            {\n              value: externalMeetingUrl,\n              propertyName: \"hs_meeting_external_url\",\n              operator: \"EQ\",\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n      ],\n      limit: 1,\n      sorts: [],\n      properties: [\n        \"hs_internal_meeting_notes\",\n        \"hs_meeting_body\",\n        \"hs_meeting_location\",\n      ],\n      after: 0,\n    });```\nI got no results but I’m also confident this meeting was already in your DB as I’ve seen it on my Meetings tab in HubSpot; also request was successful when I used Postman to fetch the data using the same parameters.\nany clues what could go wrong here?"

    "text": "Hi there HubSpot Dev community!\n\nI have a general question for any integration builders out there. I’m currently working through the first version of a new integration that will pull KPI related data from both CRM objects and engagements and send them into a different platform. When doing so I’ve been able to successfully build out small increment syncs using the search the CRM api endpoint(s) and filtering by lastmodifieddate….so essentially every 10m i look for new or updated records at any of these object/engagement endpoints and then clean up the data (un-nest it) and send it into another platform successfully.\n\nI’m currently mulling over how to build out a flexible historical import for any potential HubSpot account using the integration i’m building. Ideally I’d love the flexibility to import ALL records from ANY specific point in time for ANY HS account/user. Perhaps a 1 month historical import or a 1 quarter historical import. The problem i’m seeing is that there may not be a clear way to do this that would be uniform across all use cases.\n\nLet’s take for example COMPANIES.  (screenshot of my notes for all likely candidates for a historical import)\n\nIt seems as if I can either do EVERYTHING or i’m capped by either the 30day limit OR 10k limit any way I try to solve this…. biggest problem with using the search endpoint is that there’s no way for me to know where the 10k limit would be between any 2 companies. For a large company that has data syncs with other software in their tech stack it may well be that I hit 10k in a 1 day period and another company may have 10k in their lifetime period (of having a HubSpot account)….\n\nAny thoughts or ideas? (Alternatively, considering scratching the ability for my integration to handle a customizable historical import) :cry:",
