    "text": "I'm new to HubSpot CMS... I come from mainly a WordPress background where I had my own custom made Bootstrap 4 theme. How difficult is it to use Bootstrap 5 with HubSpot CMS? As I understand it, HS is built on the Bootstrap 2 scaffolding/grid. I just find BS2 lacking in terms of responsive functionality and I'm used to coding with BS4. I was thinking I'd use BS5 because it's the newest one ... I never did update my old WordPress theme to the latest BS. Is it a matter of mapping the BS2 classes to the BS5 ones, and overriding the CSS? Has anyone already done this in a base theme for HubSpot already that I can just use?"
