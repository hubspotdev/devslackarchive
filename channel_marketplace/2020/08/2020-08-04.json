    "text": "Hello everyone, we would like to create a stand alone landing page to upload to the market place. I'm working with themes, actually with three themes at this moment. But I'm trying to find out how can I create one stand alone landing page this way and I'm not finding info for that, should I create a theme and upload only that section to the marketplace? Is there a way to just have one stylesheet and page for it? How does it work?",
