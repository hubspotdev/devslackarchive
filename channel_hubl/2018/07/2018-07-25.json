Do you think is possible to do?",

The \"Label\" value of each option is human-readable, and the value is the foreign key. I'd like to render the *value* attached to the contact record in a page, so that I can use the value. Unfortunately when rendering these properties using HUBL eg `{ contact.MyDropdownProperty}` (outside of a form), it renders the label and not the value."

    "text": "Separate question: *Personalization Tokens On Thank You Pages*\nIt seems like saving contact data to a HS contact is asynchronous from page rendering. If you try to render a Thank You page and want to use data from the form (e.g. \"Thank you `{ contact.first_name }`\" there's a high likelihood that HS has not yet processed the form, and the property will be empty.\n\nIn the past, I've used an \"interstitial\" page that uses `setTimeout` to wait before client-side redirecting to the Thank You page. But surely there's a better way. \n\nAny ideas?"

Per this article (<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/articles/kcs_article/cos-general/how-to-use-personalization-with-your-content>), if you are using personalization tokens on a thank you page, the values for these tokens will only populate for known contacts. If a new contact fills out a form and is redirected to a thank you page with a token, there isnâ€™t enough time for the data to process and populate the right information. If a default value is set, the new contact will see the default value on the thank you page."
