    "text": "I can only assume using the older version of the api isn’t recommended for new projects. Especially if you’re using it to get around some limits. If you need a more complex search solution it may be best to index the data yourself? I guess it depends on what you’re trying to achieve, for example - if you’re letting a user paginate through results in your interface anything over a few hundred results is going to be a bad UX - if, on the other hand you’re implementing some sort of ETL process then  it may be best just to use the contacts API.\n\nSearch endpoints generally are usually backed by some sort of search index/service so, they may also be missing records (and may be slow to update)"
