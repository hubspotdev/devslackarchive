    "text": "I'm not sure what the best place to post this is, but does anyone else have issues with previewing HubL templates and modules on Windows?  Both via the HubSpot CLI with `hs theme preview` and the CMS dev server directly `hs-cms-dev-server` (CMS themes vs projects workflows).  The initial preview works, but updates don't go through.  This only applies to HubL files; React-based modules and partials work fine.\n\nI think I've narrowed it down to the `uploadFile()` function in <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@HubSpot/cms-dev-server|@HubSpot/cms-dev-server> (which doesn't have a public GitHub, hence my posting here).  When I log the error it tells me my session token is invalid, so maybe not an issue with that function per se, but however the session token is handled, and the function is just where the failure point is.  When logging the token, everything seems good with it being created/refreshed at the start of the preview and it gets its expiration set to 24 hours later.\n\nI've replicated this on both my work and personal PCs.  I've also had a coworker try on his Mac, and everything works fine for him.\n\nHere are a couple screenshots of my barebones setups to repro:\nUsing Node version 22.13.1 (via NVM for Windows if that makes a difference)",
