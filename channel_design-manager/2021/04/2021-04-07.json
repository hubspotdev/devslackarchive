    "text": "Hi, friends!\n\nI have a coding issue that I need help finding. We have some styling coded in on a css file I don't think I have access to. It's part of our branding, so I assume one of our team members added it, but I cannot find it. When I inspect it in Chrome, it's coming from the main.min.css file. Does anyone know where can I find this?",

Yes, but the styles are definitely coded in, All of the links (incl butons) have padding to the right and a background defined to look like an underline:\n`background: linear-gradient(0,#01e499 2px,transparent 0);` \n`padding-right: 1.5rem;`  \n\nI have a test page here: <https://resources.within3.com/test>\n\nThe css is pointing to main.min.css - I can see and edit main.css in this same folder, but it doesn't have the above code in it"
