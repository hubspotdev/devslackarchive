    "text": "Hey guys - since cusotm modules can get very fast out of control with a ton of options and grouping them can be \"a click more\" - could we please have a seperator \"function\" for custom modules? Just a 1px line with a text above which the developer can place between the custom module options to help the user/marketer see what belongs together without opening a group. This seperator should be visibile only in the left sidebar when editing the module and not be rendered to the final page(like groups). Would be great!"
