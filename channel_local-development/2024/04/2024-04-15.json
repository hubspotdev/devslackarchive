    "text": "Hey Rod - UI Extensions are not just front-end solutions. There is a serverless backend for which your front-end will talk with.  I encourage you begin with a \"sample project\" and get that working on a dev environment.\n\nThe error your are referencing is likely due to app.json file where you define your paths to your \"card.json\" config which then references your .jsx component.\n\nThere is quite a bit more involved here. DM me if you'd like to work with on a consulting basis and I can help get you more familiar with the toolkit."
