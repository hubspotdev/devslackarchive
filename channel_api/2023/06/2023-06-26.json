Great community.\n\n I'm new to HubSpot API so the question might seem a bit basic : I'd like to create a webhook that would send some line items properties after a deal is won.\n1. in the worflows, should I use \"send a webhook\" or \"custom code\"?\n2. I would need the SKU (ID), quantity, discount, unit price, frequency of all line items + the deal ID and company ID associated + total discount and VAT of the quote \nThe end goal is to retrieve the information in Make to send it to another system\n\nThanks in advanced, I'm a bit stuck now !",
