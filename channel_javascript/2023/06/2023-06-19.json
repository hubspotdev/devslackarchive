    "text": "Hey all, I'm working with a wordpress site that is using the HubSpot api. There is a form which asks for a user to sign up with an email and password along with other fields. I'm looking to leverage the `identify` function to create a Contact on HubSpot which is made with the current call to my app to create a user. One thing I should mention is that I dont have access to the wordpress site code so I'm trying to run JS snippets on the wordpress site in the dev console.\nFirst I execute:\n```hq= _hsq.push([\"identify\",{\n    email: '<mailto:cobiTEST@testjs.com|cobiTEST@testjs.com>',\n    firstname: 'Cobi',\n    lastname: 'TESTER',\n    leadsource: 'IC Email Buiilder Demo',\n    ic_email_buiilder_demo: 'true',\n    phone: '+1123123123',\n    jobtitle: 'CEO',\n    company: 'CM Dev Team Testers'\n}]); ```\nThen I execute a track event so the data is passed to HubSpot\n```_hsq.push(['trackPageView']);```\nThe problem I'm running into is that no call is being made to HubSpot to make a new Contact record. Any advice?",
