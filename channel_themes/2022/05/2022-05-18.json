I’m not sure our use cases are 100% the same - I’m a dev on a marketing team, so it might be different if you’re working with separate clients - but I’m currently using child themes to manage this. I’ve got one core theme with our global modules &amp; other shared assets, and several different child themes for not-core work. Each is in a separate repo under one github org.\n\nI’m also, however, using webpack, and my HubL macros are in an npm package. The file gets copied into each theme on build. Something along those lines might be another option, depending on the type of assets your themes share."
