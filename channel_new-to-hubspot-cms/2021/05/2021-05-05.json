They want a newsletter signup in the footer with juste one email field \"smart\" that when submitted would fire a popup form with the email field plus name perhaps company etc.\nWould this be possible with both forms being HubSpot forms and without having to embark some sort of custom \"lightbox\" function ?\n\nAppreciate it if anyone has any ideas :slightly_smiling_face:"
