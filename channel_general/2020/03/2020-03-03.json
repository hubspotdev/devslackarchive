For LinkedIn, however, they seem to have deprecated the functionality I've previously used. The link still works, but now only accepts the url, and stripping any other parameters. The only other option is their API which requires multi-step authentication which I think would mean building out a web service, and not the best user experience IMO. This seems like something that should be simple, so wondering if I'm missing something.",
