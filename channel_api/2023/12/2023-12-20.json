    "text": "*EDIT: Fixed, realized I have to specify the use of checkboxes in the second example, thank you Evelynn! ///* Hello everyone - I have a very strange situation happening with HubSpot forms and the <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/advanced_form_options|form embed /forms API>.\nWe have used the form embed customization plenty of times with our clients to help route form submissions to different pages based off a submission's answers _(so for example, if someone fills out a form and chooses California for their state, upon form submission they would redirect to a specific meeting link)_\n\nHowever, recently, the code doesn't work anymore for new forms created. At least from what I can tell. I have been pulling out my hair over this and was advised to reach out here. I am using essentially the same working code on a different form, but it's not working :sob:  Any advice would be appreciated. Did anything change with the forms API I am not aware of? These are all contact properties btw.\n\nHere's some examples -\n\nForm #1 - Works fine - <https://www.harvestroi.com/test-2> (redirects based off answer for b2b,b2c etc)\nCode -\n``` <script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//js.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  hbspt.forms.create({\n   region: \"na1\",\n  portalId: \"PORTALID\",\n  formId: \"FORMID\",\n  onFormSubmit: function($form) {\n    var favouriteFruit = $form.find('select[name=\"b2b_or_b2c\"]').val();\n\n    setTimeout( function() {\n      if ( favouriteFruit == \"B2B (business to business)\" ) {\n        window.location.href = \"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple>\";\n      }       \n      if ( favouriteFruit == \"B2C (business to consumer)\" ) {\n        window.location.href = \"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana>\";\n      }      \n      if ( favouriteFruit == \"Both\" ) {\n        window.location.href = \"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape>\";\n      }\n      if ( favouriteFruit == \"Niether\" ) {\n        window.location.href = \"<https://en.wikipedia.org/>\";\n      }\n\n    }, 500 ); // Waits 1/2 second to redirect.\n  }\n});\n</script>  ```\nForm #2 - Does NOT work, essentially has the same code though !? (link) <https://www.harvestroi.com/test> (supposed to redirect to different pages for small business owner and deal service providers)\nCode -\n``` <script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//js.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  hbspt.forms.create({\n   region: \"na1\",\n  portalId: \"PORTALID\",\n  formId: \"FORMID\",\n  onFormSubmit: function($form) {\n    var favouriteFruit = $form.find('select[name=\"contact_type\"]').val();\n\n    setTimeout( function() {\n      if ( favouriteFruit == \"Deal Service Providers\" ) {\n        window.location.href = \"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple>\";\n      }       \n      if ( favouriteFruit == \"Brokers / Investment Bankers\" ) {\n        window.location.href = \"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana>\";\n      }      \n    }, 500 ); // Waits 1/2 second to redirect.\n  }\n});\n</script>  ```",

If not, fire an email to both of us (or whomever) with some details on the record. \nThis would allow us to find out when these happen and to get them fixed (we could also auto fix them in this workflow based upon the building name and some extra code!)\n• This won’t solve HOW this is happening but then we can notice these sooner, review if someone updated that property that day, and say.. well maybe this was a user. If the record wasn’t updated that day -- then we can begin to start questioning HubSpot and send this over to them as a support item with some evidence that it is happening and could be a bug.\nOnce I see that this is happening I can then debug this a bit more"
