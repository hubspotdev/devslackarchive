I am working on importing several blogs for a client, but the import files have been hanging in \"in progress\" and I am unable to start importing new ones as well (perhaps because of the hanging imports). I contacted support but so far they can only help me manually upload the xml but the same issues persist. Is it possible to get a HubSpotter looking into this deeper with me?",
