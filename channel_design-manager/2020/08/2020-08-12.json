    "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm creating a boilerplate theme for our HubSpot projects based in the HubSpot Boilerplate Theme.\n\nI'd like to be able to set some default variables in the theme's fields.json or import them in that file so that moving the theme from a dev environment to a live enviroment will move the Theme Options that were set in the dev environment as well.\n\nAny ideas on how I could accomplish that other than using the default field in each theme option? I'd like to have them all in one place at the beginning of the file or in another file for ease of use. It's very hard navigating through the fields.json to find each field's default value.\n\nThanks!"
