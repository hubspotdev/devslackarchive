Works on Chrome and Firefox\n\nThere is a v2 branch on the Github repo, there are instruction in the readme to install it.\n<https://github.com/GonzaloTorreras/HubSpot-Developer-Extension/tree/v2>\n\nIt basically re built from scratch, and I've strip the design for now\n\nThere is a few new features\n\n*Option Menu*\nThis is how you turn stuff on and you can now add/edit the dev menu\n\n*Edit Module in Design Manager*\nWhile on a HS page and the Sprocket Menu is present, click it and then click on a module. It'll open in the DM (kinda like developer mode in the page editor)\n\n*HubSpot Panel in the console*\nJust shows the developer info\n\n\nThis is still very much a beta, only I have tested/used it, so there is probably issues :slightly_smiling_face:",
