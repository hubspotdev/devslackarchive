The instructions explicitly say to NOT use the boilerplate CSS, BUT it also wants grid-based drag-and-drop… The grid stuff comes from the boilerplate layout and CSS and I REALLY don’t want to have to reinvent the wheel and/or use some other grid-based stuff to try to get this working… Help? <@U3PKJ8EQL> <@U02227D27V3>",
