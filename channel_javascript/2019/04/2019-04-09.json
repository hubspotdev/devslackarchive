    "text": "Hi Guys,\n\nI am quite stucked with an issue. I am working on HubSpot form. I created a multi step form.\nFirst form has email address but second doesnot have. Maybe because of that I couldnt see second form\nsubmissions in contacts submission details.I thought of adding hidden email field in second form and populate with\nemail value from first form. I captured the value based on onFormSubmit event. I can see the value correctly in the\nvariable like this: email=$(\"input[name=email]\").val();\n\nInorder to set that value to second form , I tried $(\"input[name=email]\").val(email).change() ; on second forms\nsubmission code.On console.log I can see the email address correctly but it is not creating submissions if i check in that contact submissions.\n\nI tried Autoprepopulate using query string. But that doesnt work as both my forms are in same page.From my understanding,\nin order to enable that feature, you should provide a link to user with the parameters, in this case email.\n\nDoes anyone knows a solution for this."

    "text": "thanks <@U3T21PDBK> it worked when I changed the value on submission of first form. May I know why it didn't worked when give it on second form submit....as the field was hidden I thought passing the email on second forms submit will also pass data correctly?"
