I'm putting together a \"all-in-one\"-module just to show our designers what is available and not, but (while using `hs watch` , CLI) I get an uploading error complaining about invalid default values on the Spacing field (taken directly from <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/module-theme-fields#spacing>)\nIs anyone able to spot what's wrong about the default values from the documentation example? (beside it missing a comma in the default-padding-bottom object)\n\nAccording to the documentation everything is as it should be; I'd assume the only needed values within top/bottom/left/right is the `value`\n and `units[]` properties(?).\nI also changed the default values from \"25\" to \"26\" in case the \"Limit\" field (that is set to minimum 25) was causing issues by not including 25"
