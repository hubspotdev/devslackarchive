    "text": "*Dec 2022 updates for CRM development beta*\n\nWe want to provide a quick recap of the CRM Development beta in 2022 and share some recent updates with you.\n\nFirst and foremost, we want to thank you for your participation in the beta and for providing us with valuable feedback along the way. Your input has been instrumental in helping us improve and refine the product. If you haven’t already, be sure to take a look at our full <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG1clcPRVYw&amp;list=PLTGNq2fWP3b1AvgTGd0WqE3i9h9aVdOCk|HubSpot.extend() playlist> for a comprehensive overview of everything we released in 2022, and more. We are also in the process of adding several new code samples to our <https://github.com/HubSpot/ui-extensions-examples|public GitHub repository>.\n\nIn terms of recent updates, we have made a few improvements based on your feedback.\n\n*New Select Input (for single select) component*\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/create-custom-crm-cards-with-projects#select-input|Select input component> allows you to create cards with single input selections. This component takes care of consistency with the Select lists that you find elsewhere in HubSpot, and also automatically adds search option for list items &gt; 7. Check it out with <https://app.HubSpot.com/l/extensible-ui/|the interactive playground>. We are aware of the requirements for multi-select, and are working on that too.\n\n*<https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C04A3FUK8HK/p1670530364146149|Private beta: components for CRM properties and reports>*\n\nWe now have two new components available to use when creating a custom CRM card to display on a record page. This beta builds on the existing CRM development tools and allows you to display cards with editable properties and HubSpot reports. If interested, get in touch with <@U04CMAG0MHU>.\n\n*Improvements in existing UI components*\n\n• Image re-size and actions: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/create-custom-crm-cards-with-projects#image|Image> component now allows image resize with `height` and `width` parameters. It also accepts `onClick`resizing parameter that’s available for buttons. \n• Action-able tags: Similar to images, <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/create-custom-crm-cards-with-projects#image|tags> also accept the `onClick` parameter\n• <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/create-custom-crm-cards-with-projects#input|Input> component allows `placeholder`, `description`, and `tooltip`.\n*Development Sandboxes*\n• We’ve heard from some solution partners working in their Partner Demo Portals that they’ve encountered an `esockettimeout error` in the CLI when creating a development sandbox. For any partner who encountered this, please let us know, as this will help us determine the occurrence of it.\n• Currently, if you have opted into CRM Development tools beta in your partner demo portal, your standard sandbox or development sandbox might not allow you to see CRM Development tools due to a bug. We’re aware of this and working on a fix that will be live in early 2023.\n*Serverless functions timeout limit increase &amp; logs improvements*\nBased on your <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CRM-Development-Tools-Beta/Function-Run-Time-of-2-Seconds-for-CRM-Cards-is-Horrendous/td-p/713523|feedback>, we have increased the timeout limits for serverless functions to 5s. We also worked out a bunch of improvements in error reporting and logs for both projects and private apps, for a better debugging experience.\n\nOnce again, thank you again for your participation in the beta. We value your contribution and look forward to continuing to work with you in the coming year. We value your feedback and would love any suggestions or ideas you may have. Here are some ways to get in touch:\n\n• Use `hs feedback` on CLI\n• <https://forms.gle/Fg3k6BmLCDegUx8Z9|Feedback form>\n• <https://HubSpot.com/meetings/mhazlewood2/dpg-feedback-interview|Meeting link>\n• <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C04A3FUK8HK/p1668107394841849|Slack channel> or <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CRM-Development-Tools-Beta/gh-p/crm-development-tools-beta|community group>",
