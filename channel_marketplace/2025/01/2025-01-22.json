Ideally I'd close a deal, create an associated record in a custom object and then grant multiple users/non users access to a document generated from a template where they can then tick checkboxes/add comments/upload images.\n\nDoes something like this exist?"

    "text": "The app is free to install, there are also videos and screenshots on the marketplace page. I don’t know if it gives you something more.\n\nUI Extensions have a specific sdk and components that are available. Not everything that HubSpot has access to is possible with UI Extensions.\n\nThe idea behind UI Extensions is that you have a place to put these on records. So if you were looking to integrate contact records, and having a blue sky property that could feed data to it, that would be possible if their is an api available.\n\nAs far as creating a dashboard to schedule posts, it would be a bit janky to go to like a deal object and see all the posts.\n\nI think it is worth diving into more details into what you are trying to do and explore the ui extension examples or any of the youtube content that has the devrel team go over them.\n\nI wish I could help you better, I don’t know what twitter app social media does or is or what is default in HubSpot, but the ui extension is meant to be something that sits on objects"
