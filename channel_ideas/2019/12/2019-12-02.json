    "text": "Hi <@UDRRGE9J4> and <@UQQUR3Y5D>, great questions.  A11y is  very important to us. I don’t have an immediate answer on these questions directly but I am reporting these issues to the forms team. I can’t promise quick turn-around on this. Any changes to HubSpot forms HTML can be a breaking change if a developer added custom styling or javascript modifications to a form. That said A11y is something I personally care a lot about and will work with the forms team to find a solution that is right for everyone."
