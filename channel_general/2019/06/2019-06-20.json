This is something that we don’t support.  When people have tried it, it generally ends up looking like DOS attack to our WAF and we do not whitelist IPs of proxies.  Not to mention it negates the benefits of the CDN that we provide.  If you want a HubSpot hosted site, it will have to be a on a subdomain."
