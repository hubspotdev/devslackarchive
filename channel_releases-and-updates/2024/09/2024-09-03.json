    "text": "Hey Olia, this is good feedback. We have tags but admittedly the tags in that blog are a known mess. Basically over time as the product has evolved things have been renamed, ultra granular tags become problematic with just like 1 item in them, super broad tags also problematic because they sometimes cover way too many unrelated things. Usage of the tags as well is extremely low.\n\nIn an ideal world we’d have a way to subscribe to notifications based on topics. We don’t have a solid way to do that right now without making things complicated behind the scenes.\n\nWe will be redesigning the changelog relatively soon. If folks have ideas/thoughts on how we could make it easier to filter or find changelogs you’re looking for, let us know. We are listening.\n\nWith that said too - it is possible that if we release a redesign that has improved filtering etc. Some filters may not initially work on really old changelog posts as we’ll need to backfill the data that’s used to filter. But any net new posts would work with that filtering right away."
