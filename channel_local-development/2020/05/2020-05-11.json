And sometimes we do need to make changes to the artwork, so being able to quickly upload the new version which overwrites the old is super helpful"

Tried a bunch of timestamp adjustments, but in the end it would try and upload everything. So my work around was just to make a temp asset folder, export the optimized assets into there, then scrub it clean everytime. That way only changed or new files were uploaded to the FM"
