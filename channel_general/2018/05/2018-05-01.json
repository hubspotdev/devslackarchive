    "text": "been thinking about this over the last couple months. I kinda feel like it’d be nice if the developer docs were more like a wiki, or had a good tool to suggest updates inline.\n\ndownside to a wiki is that it’d be hard to distinguish between HubSpot supported techniques and functions vs stuff that could break down the road.\n\nexample: My boss was fighting with the selectattr() function for like 30 minutes because the documentation doesn’t show an example of the second parameter being used, and the syntax for it isn’t obvious.(we got it working, but it’d be nice if we could update the documentation to explain that)\n\nThe other reason is that atleast in the past there were numerous functions and filters that worked but were not documented. There currently are still a bunch of variables that you can find in developer info if you know where to look, that you can reference but are not explained."
