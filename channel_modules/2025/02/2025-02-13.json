    "text": "*Trouble Combining Two Custom Modules in HubSpot Email Templates*\nHi everyone,\nI'm having trouble combining two custom modules that I built for an email template in HubSpot. Each module works fine on its own, but when I try to merge them, the layout gets messed up.\n\nI suspect the issue might be related to the &lt;style&gt; tags inside the HTML code, since CSS isn't allowed in email modules. However, Iâ€™m not entirely sure if that's the root cause or if something else is interfering with the rendering.\n\nI've attached screenshots to show how the modules look separately vs. how they appear when combined. Any insights or suggestions on how to properly merge these without breaking the layout would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",
