    "text": "Hi all, we are playing around with the Service Support Form (not normal forms). We embedded the form with JS in one of our external pages but we are having issues with the `onFormReady` event to pre-populate form field values. We have done it with \"normal\" forms without issues in the past, but there seems to be something wrong with Support Form. The jquery selector for our fields, does not find the element (it returns empty), for example: `$('input[name=\"email\"]')`. Therefore we cannot pre-populate the value. Has anyone faced something similar?",
