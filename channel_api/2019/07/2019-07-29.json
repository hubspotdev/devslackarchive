The Forms API endpoints:\n• `v2`: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form>\n• `v3`: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form_v3)>\nwon’t automatically grab the `HubSpotutk` cookie value and place it in the `hutk` parameter. You’ll have to make sure you’re capturing and passing the correct value through your own implementation.\n\nCan you share links to example contacts which are showing the same analytics data? I can confirm whether the same `hutk` was passed."

Happy to clarify.\n\nOnce you’ve created an app in your developer account, you can connect it to a production or test account by completing the OAuth flow described here: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/initiate-oauth-integration>. At a high level, this involves:\n1) Navigating to an auth URL which includes your app’s scopes in the `scope` parameter and desired redirect page in the `redirect_uri` parameter.\n2) Clicking the CTA to connect the integration.\n3) Copying the `code` appended to the redirect URI.\n4) Using the `code` to make a request to this endpoint (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/get-access-and-refresh-tokens>) to get access and refresh tokens.\n\nWe also have an OAuth quickstart guide here (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/oauth2-quickstart>) which covers the same steps with practical examples."
