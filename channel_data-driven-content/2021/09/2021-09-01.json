    "text": "I have an issue where, when using a dynamic page linked to a HubDB table, the `dynamic_page_hubdb_row`  data that I thought would be available via the URL is `null`. I have the page path (hs_path) column populated with \"insight-details-development,\" with a dynamic page path of \"/insights\" - set together as `/insights/insight-details-development`. I'm viewing this in preview, so it comes with the `hs_preview` query, but no other values apply. Any thoughts on why this will not produce a dataset from the HubDB row? Thanks."
