    "text": "heya all, hoping to get a solution to a problem. I've got a CTA designed to print up a popup. I've discovered using a button works just fine in showing the popup but client wants data tracking that comes with CTAs. The issue is that with a CTA left clicking does not seem to perform an action but right clicking does, however, right clicking it throws an error \"Uncaught syntaxError: expected expression, got end of script\"\n\nThis happens with both custom CTA (using BETA) and HubSpots default call-to-action module. I also get this set of messages on page load and I'm not quite sure if it has any relation as to why this might be happening.\n\nI've tried quite a few things but nothing seems to get the popup, works just fine in the CTA builder previewer but on pages it does nothing :upside_down_face:  Thanks all!",
