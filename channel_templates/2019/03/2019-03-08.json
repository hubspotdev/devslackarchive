    "text": "Hello all. This may be a stupid question, but I will ask it for clarity. In one of the videos, the presenter talks about disabling the float of the bootstrap grid, in order to place a class on the main content body and center it within the page.. He goes on to declare a max-width on that main content body and centers it with \"margin: 0 auto\". The last two steps are pretty common. I am confused as to when your'e supposed to disable the grid floats like this. Do you do this just for centering main content areas? Are you supposed to disable the float on every element you place on the drag and drop? I am just wondering about the extent to which you disable the floats for grids. Thanks in advance..",
