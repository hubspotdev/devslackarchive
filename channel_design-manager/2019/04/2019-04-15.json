I was hoping to find the raw file itself so that I could fit it to a bootstrap 4 layout but no such luck.\n2) Does the site search module work in preview mode? I have implemented the module using its core code but it won't output search results.",

You can use css to style it, and you could use a dummy form if you have to create the exact form styles in bootstrap. Otherwise just use CSS to make it look how you want. everything has classes on it already."
