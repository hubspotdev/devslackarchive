    "text": ":wave: Slack Community!\n\nAs many of you know, in the past, this Slack has been a great resource for communication, collaboration, and learning for all. At HubSpot, we not only recognize the value this Slack has been to our platform developers but also take great pride in this community. To keep in line with our Culture Code and continue to look to the long term and Solve for not only our customers but our developers. *We are happy to announce we have invested in our community and upgraded our Slack to a Paid Plan!* So, what does this mean? As always, this Slack instance is not an official support channel of HubSpot, we still recommend reaching out through in-app support or our dedicated forums (<https://community.HubSpot.com/>) if you are looking for support from HubSpot, however, with our upgrade we now get the following:\n\n*We now have access to all our old messages from the beginning of time.* \nFrom awesome collaborations to stellar ideas and solutions, we now get to view them in all their glory.\n\n*Increased Storage*\nEach user now gets 10 GB of storage each, perfect for all those pictures of cats/dogs or code.\n\n*Group Video Calls and Screen Sharing*\nWe had normal 1-1 voice calling before, but now we have the ability for group collaborations and even screen sharing. \n\nWe have a lot of ideas and planning that we are doing for this slack so stay tuned! Also, if you have any questions, comments, or ideas, please feel free to share them with us as a thread on this message.\n\nLikewise, we now have an official Code of Conduct for our Slack. Please be sure to review this here: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/slack/code-of-conduct>",

Yeah the subscription types are completely separate from lists, so you'd still have to add them somehow to them as the platform won't let you send an email without selecting one. If contacts aren't subscribed to that type, they won't receive the email even if they're on the list you're sending to."
