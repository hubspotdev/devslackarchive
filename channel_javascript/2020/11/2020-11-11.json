    "text": "I’m really new to HubSpot, but the client I am working with has a similar issue with a bunch on unnecessary scripts being called. There is one place I sometimes find odd bits like this. If you log into HubSpot, and click on the settings icon near your profile pic / username, this will bring you to the ‘Settings’ page.\n\nThere will be a sidebar menu on the left. At the bottom, open up ‘Website’, and click on ‘Blog’.\n\nNext, in the options that open, there will be a tab titled ‘Templates’. Clicking on that, reveals a section called ’Header HTML”.\n\nThis is another area where custom header HTML can be added to blogs. Maybe you will find the culprit there?\n\nAs a note, the other options under ‘Website’ in the sidebar, have similar spots for custom HTML"

When users submit the form, in addition to allowing HubSpot to do whatever it does to process the form, I also need to run some code to an API, and then update the DOM based on the response.\n\nHow might I integrate my javascript into this process?",
