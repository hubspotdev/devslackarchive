    "text": "How are people handling event listings with HubDB? For example; displaying them on a homepage but need to have them sorted by date, but the date is a range so we are using a text field rather than the date field. Is it possible to do this? And is it possible to set how many we want to pull from the database? I assume it is.\n\nAs a separate question; on an actual Events page, can you have 2 sections; One for Upcoming and one for Past; and then have some query that looks at the date range and today's date and based on that it populates the list below each header?"
