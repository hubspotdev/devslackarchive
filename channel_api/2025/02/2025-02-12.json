    "text": "<@U08ADN9HENT> A workflow has to be set up for a particular object type - contact, deal, company, etc. and then a trigger must be chosen to allow that object type to \"enroll\" in the workflow by meeting the trigger criteria.  You can't do that just by using the ID for the workflow, you must do whatever it takes to make the trigger fire.  Maybe I could help if I can understand what are you trying to accomplish?  Can you describe what you're trying to do?  There is a workflow api you can look at But I don't think that will do what you are asking.  <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/reference/api/automation/create-manage-workflows>"
