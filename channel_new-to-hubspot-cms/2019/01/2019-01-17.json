I don't believe you can create nested custom categories..\n\nI did dig up some help docs that outline how to create custom properties in tickets - you could review to see if they help get you the answer:\n\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/articles/kcs_article/contacts/how-can-i-create-a-custom-property>\n\n<https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3AHubSpot.com+custom+property+into+a+ticket&amp;oq=site%3AHubSpot.com+custom+property+into+a+ticket&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.4269j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8>\n\nAlso - You could ask in the community which specializes in tickets: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Tickets-Conversations/bd-p/service_conversations_tickets>\n\nLastly, if you have a paid HubSpot account - You could call into our customer support and chat with a rep. They can literally walk you through how to do it (if it's possible)."
