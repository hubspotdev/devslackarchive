    "text": "SSO users do not automatically have an associated contact record.  The system recognizes them as `request_contact.is_logged_in` , but if no contact record exists with their email address, then you can't really do much with their auth status besides grant them access to private content.  I don't think you can even get their email address in HubL or serverless functions.\n\nI suppose you could use some sort of SCIM-like process to ensure that any SSO user accounts are pre-created as HubSpot contact records, to ensure every SSO user will have an associated contact record when they log in.  Then you could use a contact workflow to trigger when they visited some private content page."
