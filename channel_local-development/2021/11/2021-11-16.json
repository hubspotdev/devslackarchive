    "text": "Hi there, I am trying to get bitbucket pipelines to work with HubSpot and I have done my best to copy what others have done in here. Like this bitbucket-pipelines.yml file:\n```pipelines:\n  branches:\n    master:\n      - step:\n          name: 'Install NPM deps'\n          caches:\n             - node\n          script:\n            - npm install\n      - step:\n          name: 'Deploy'\n          caches:\n             - node\n          script:\n            - bin/generate-config.js\n            - bin/deploy.sh```\nI am getting an error saying that npx command is not found in the deploy.sh step. Any insight here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
