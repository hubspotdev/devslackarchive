I’m having issues with direct stylesheets (uploaded to Design Manager, not File Manager) and the minification that happens here.\nThe stylesheets are already minified when I upload them, and they are then re-minified in HubSpot - Something seems to be buggy with the 2nd minification though, because some values are left invalid.\nExamples, all the minified code is _as seen by browser_, first case is on my local test, second is in HubSpot.\n*Transparent colors* - Raw code: `color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .5);`, minified code: `color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0);`, HubSpot minified code `color: hsla(0, 0, 100%, 0);` - Notice the missing `%` in HubSpot’s code. This causes Chrome to invalidate the property.\n*Animation* - Raw code: `animation: pulse 1s ease-in-out 0s infinite;`, minified code: `animation: pulse 1s ease-in-out 0s infinite;`, HubSpot minification: `animation: pulse 1s ease-in-out 0 infinite;` - Notice the missing `s`.
