    "text": "Feature request: One issue I see with custom modules (especially the ones in the marketplace) is it is hard to know if they are being placed in a page that contains \"layout.css\" because it looks like this is stripped out of coded templates. <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/cos/included-cos-files>\n\nI think HubSpot should included this stylesheet on all templates including the coded templates. Otherwise it will need to be added in each individual module to make sure it supports both. What do you think?"
