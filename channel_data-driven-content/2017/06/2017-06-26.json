    "text": "Okay, so here's a weird one.\n<http://2492639.hs-sites.com/resources>\nI've got this resources page. This is a dynamic page, fed from HubDB. There are two tables, one which contains the resources themselves (thumbnails, titles, links, categories, and so on), and one which has some metadata for the \"resource type\" column on the other table. The page is dynamic based on the latter, so the subpages are like <http://2492639.hs-sites.com/resources/ebook-whitepapers> and <http://2492639.hs-sites.com/resources/case-study> (there are other filters, but those are just based on URL queries).\nThat all works fine, except for \"webinars\". The webinars page just 404's.\n<http://2492639.hs-sites.com/resources/webinars>\nThe really weird part is, if we change the page path to anything else (even just \"webinar\" or \"webinar-resources\" or something), it _does_ work. it just doesn't like exactly \"webinars\". We can't find any redirects or page conflicts that would apply to this and I'm not sure what else to check. I can't think of a reason this wouldn't work. We'd like the url to be \"webinars\" if possible. Any ideas?"
