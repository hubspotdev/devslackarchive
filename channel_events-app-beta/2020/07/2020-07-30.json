    "text": "Hi Guys, \n\nI have recently started to explore events within HubSpot, prior to this i used to use Eventbrite to manage my events , but the problem with using Eventbrite was source tracking , I wanted to know where my source came from as in when i post one of the event that was created in eventbrite on my social media (Facebook/Linkedin), Lets say the user clicks on that event ad on my Facebook and registers, the contact that gets created on HubSpot just says it was created using \"offline sources integration platform” and original source down drill as Eventbrite registration. But I wanted to know precisely where the contact came from like Facebook or Linkedin. So while looking into I came through this events app beta version. So I wanted to know if this will help in source tracking if ago ahead and create those event pages on my website instead of using Eventbrite. Looking forward for some insights , thank you. Appreciate the help",
