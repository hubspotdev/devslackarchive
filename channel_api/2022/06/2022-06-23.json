And yes, I follow the CLI guide, but when I use my Visual Studio Code, I keep getting [ERROR] `src` is a module path but `dest` is not. What do I do wrong with the destination? What should be included in it? I'm working in folder that is already authenticated, so I use something simple as /My_Theme/modules, which is copied path from  the design manager. Thank you for your help :slightly_smiling_face:"

I am trying to use the Analytics API to get all the campaign data and related metrics, but when I want to use the daily time period instead of the total, it requires me to use an additional filter, but I do not want to filter the data further.\n\nIn the documentation, it is not clear how to use the filter option clearly and what are all the options, so I tried to use a dummy filter like *&amp;f=true* to call the API, but it returns an empty result. I just want to get the same result as the total one, but in the daily format. Below, you can find the 2 requests that I am using. I am looking forward to cooperating, thank you!\n\n<https://api.hubapi.com/analytics/v2/reports/utm-campaigns/total?hapikey=MYKEY&amp;start=20220101&amp;end=20220601>\n\nAbove request works well but it shows the result in the total format.\n\n<https://api.hubapi.com/analytics/v2/reports/utm-campaigns/daily?hapikey=MYKEY&amp;start=20220101&amp;end=20220601&amp;f=googleadwords_int>\n\nAbove query works well too, but I want to get the results for all the campaigns instead of filtering with only one campaign.\n\nLink of the documentation: <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/analytics/get-analytics-data-breakdowns>"
