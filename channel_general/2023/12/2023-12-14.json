Basically we need to send an agreement to be signed by our donors, and we would like to populate the document with a combination of company and custom fields. I thought sending it from the Company record and then choosing a Contact as the recipient would solve this, but I seem to keep running into issues. I chatted with DocuSigns Developer support yesterday too and went through the logs and it seems to be working as expected on their end. If this solution doesnt work, I would also like to use the HubSpot and DocuSign API's to create a custom solution, but I am not sure how this would work or where I would actually place the code for this to work."

    "text": "Welcome to the community, glad to have you here!\n\nTo get your API key that you’ll be including as a secret, you’ll need to go into your portal settings and create a new private app with the appropriate permissions. (*Settings > Account Setup > Integrations > Private App > Create a Private App*) Once created, you should be presented with an authentication key that you can reveal and copy.\n\nTo use that key within a custom code action, you’ll want to add it as a secret. To add a secret to a custom code workflow action, edit the action and make sure you have the *Edit Action* tab selected. Under *Secrets*, select *Add Secret*. Give your secret a name (conventionally, this would be in all-caps and underscore delineated. ie `MY_SECRET_NAME`) and paste the API key from your private app as the value.\n\nTo access that key within your action, you can retrieve it from the `process.env` environment variables object:\n```const HS_AUTH_KEY = process.env.MY_SECRET_NAME```\nHope this helps!"

Typically, the documentation for whatever API you’re trying to hit will indicate the required scopes.\n\nThat said, I just assumed you needed to make an API call, since you’d mentioned secrets. If you don’t actually need to hit an API endpoint, you can skip private apps, API keys, and secrets altogether — you can just take in inputs from the workflow via the *Property to include in code* section."
