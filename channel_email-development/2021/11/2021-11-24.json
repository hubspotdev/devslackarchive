    "text": "<@U9KA594Q3> thank you very much. I've created a custom module with Programmable Email Beta enabled, put this module into a mail and in the module I've placed some test code:\n\n```&lt;!--\n  templateType: \"email\"\n  isAvailableForNewContent: true\n  isEnabledForEmailV3Rendering: true\n--&gt;\n{% set cb = personalization_token('contact.blob') %}\n{% set cd = cb|fromjson %}\n\nThe role is {{ cd.role }} and json is {{ cb }}```\nI created a textfield in Contact named `blob`\nWhen I trigger the mail with this data in `contact.blob` : `\"[{\\\"field1\\\": \\\"test value\\\", \\\"role\\\": \\\"developer\\\"}]\"`\nThe output is like this:",

Filters can be applied to these properties on HubSpot CMS page and blog templates.```"

    "text": "<@U9KA594Q3> A second attempt, it feels like I'm so close, but yet so far away :smile:\n\nI've created a variable in my module called `blob` and altered the module like this:\n\n```&lt;!--\n  templateType: \"email\"\n  isAvailableForNewContent: true\n  isEnabledForEmailV3Rendering: true\n--&gt;\n{% set cb = personalization_token(blob) %}\n{% set cd = cb|fromjson %}\n\nThe role is {{ cd.role }} and json is {{ cb }}```\nThen, in the mail template I've tried multiple things to pass a value to blob, but I can't find how to pass in a Contact-variable to the module, is this possible?\nThanks for your time."
