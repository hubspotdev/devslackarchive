    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a coded template into which I want to place a drag and drop area (dnd_area). When I go to create a new page based on the template, the template doesnt appear for me to select it. However, if I remove the dnd_area from the code, then the template appears and I can associate it with the page I'm creating.\n\nAny idea why this might be happening?"
