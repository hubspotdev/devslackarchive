If we choose for a list to hold membership for a page, It would be great if the list being added to the staged page would NOT send an email to the list until the page is published.\n\nHas this been thought of or could this be setup?\n\nThis would make it really smooth for building out the membership site without showing published content until \"gating\" notifications are ready.",
