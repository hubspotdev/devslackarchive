For example:\n{% macro lessons(id_lesson,id_table=\"33333\") %}\nIn this case if I don't give a value for the second argument, will use 33333?\nI just tried and seems to work.. but I would like a confirmation from the community :smile:",

Logic is allowed inside of macros.\n\nIf you’re not trying to do the same default everywhere the macro is used, you can also use `|default(\"default value\")`"
