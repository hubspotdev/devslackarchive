However, if I was adding advanced styles in form of CSS they were not working. Is there any way how to add custom styling that would be aligned with my client’s design? Can you help me out? :slightly_smiling_face:"

    "text": "Hey <@U0336QCR2FQ>, I tested this after I got your email earlier this week. Unfortunately this is in a semi-supported state right now, but I was going to reach back out once we had the docs clearly updated. The TLDR is that it seems to work with the current projects infrastructure but there are a couple big caveats.\n\nNamely, you won’t see the function or logs in the UI. Also, all functions defined this way are global — they won’t be routed or namespaced based on project or app container. So if you create two with the same path in different projects or apps, the most recent one deployed will take precedence. But otherwise they should be callable via, `https://&lt;registered-domain&gt;/_hcms/api/&lt;endpoint-path&gt;`\n\nAnother caveat is the example I got working in my own project was *very* simple, just a hello world print. I’m not sure what yours is doing but there could be other unknowns depending.\n\nHope this helps. I know you’ve got a couple other calls with HubSpot folks coming up soon but if you want to chat through any of this feel free to reach out."
