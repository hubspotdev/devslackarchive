    "text": "Hi, I have a couple of questions re: Forms. We currently have two forms on our website. Form 1 is an interest form where someone indicates interest in our product this pushes to HubSpot and de-duplicates based on email address. The person is then added to HubSpot and Contact/Company information is created. Form 2 is a registration form which creates a new account for the individual on our proprietary application. I was wondering if anyone is familiar with a way in which we can pull Company_ID from HubSpot on the submission of Form 2. Or better yet, if there is a way to combine the two forms, into one form. Thank you.",
