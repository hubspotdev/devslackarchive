    "text": "Hi, does anyone know how to get a form action URL from a HubSpot form? It looks like HubSpot only provides a shareable URL for a form and then a script to embed a form, but we have our own forms on our site that require us to directly POST to the HubSpot form. We are able to do this with Mailchimp but it doesn't seem like HubSpot offers the same functionality, or at least it's not clear to me how it works. Is this possible? The best I could find is this Community Post which shows that perhaps it is possible? <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/v3-Form-Action-Explained/m-p/895726>"
