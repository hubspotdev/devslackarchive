I HAVE seen some issues before where the support team needed to reset what was defined, if you do NOT have settings matching the experience, create a case Before you publish",

I think there’s something else going on with this one because the host domain settings aren’t matching the behaviour in content staging.\n\nIt may be that support needs to reset things, but I’m wondering if it might also be related to the fact that I’m trying to stage a multi-lingual page"
