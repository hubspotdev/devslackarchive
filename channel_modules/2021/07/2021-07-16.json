My main issue is I don’t know how they are being imported to the page.\n\nThere is a `macro.html` file that contains a header and footer. Where that is imported to so that it gets used is not clear to me. I have cloned the modules so that I can start make changes without breaking the current site, But I will need to use the new modules and at this point I don’t know how to implement them. so that they are used instead of the existing files.\n\nI hope that makes sense, I’m happy to clarify if needed."
