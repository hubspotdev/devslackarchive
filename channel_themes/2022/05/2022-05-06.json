    "text": "<@UA5DFM7CK> not sure if you've already figured this out since posting 5 months ago, but I recently updated the FAQ for POWER with the answer, hope this helps solve the mystery!\n\nWhen you are setting up system pages or blog templates, you will see at least 2 templates in the dropdown for POWER.\n\nThe first should be for the marketplace/parent theme and the second should be your first child theme.\n\nIf you have more than one child theme or a clone, you will see one template per instance of the theme. The files follow the same order that they appear in the Design Tools.\n\nIt is important to click the preview link to verify you have chosen the right one.\n\nOnce you determine the correct template in the dropdown (ex: 2 of 3), the order is the same in each dropdown so to choose the same theme you would always choose the 2nd on the list for this example.\n\nAlways preview the templates before saving."
