    "text": "Hey there, not sure where to ask this question so please refer me if you think it belongs in another channel.  My question is about intermittent HTTP 403 return codes we saw this afternoon when our pages were trying to fetch /_hcms/forms/v2.js.   That's a HubSpot javascript file that implements standard form behavior from what I can tell.  When the browser requested that file and got a 403, forms would not render at all.  Tracing this down a bit, I noticed the 403 was a response from Cloudflare (HubSpot's CDN).  After an hour or so, it corrected itself, as if someone might have cleared cache in Cloudflare.  Just a guess.  My team is interested in understanding why this happened and whether we should expect it to recur.",
