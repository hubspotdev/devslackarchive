The HubDB commands are in developer preview, and we currently only support create, fetch, clear and delete.\n\nWe understand the desire for the ability to update.\n\nIn the short-term here’s my recommendation - use the update table API <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/hubdb/v2/update_table>\n\n*Can you share the business use-case you have for why you’d like to be able to update using the CLI?* (having good use-cases helps engineering to determine priorities)"

Make a boolean in each row for toggling  the CTA on and off - Text field for what the CTA should be for that page - and Text field for the URL.\n\nYou can then build a macro for generating the CTA code and place it wherever you want in the dynamic page."
