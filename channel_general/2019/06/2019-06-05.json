I'm struggling to understand where it would find the name? Does the browser cache a user's name?",

    "text": "Thanks for jumping in Zack. Nothing specific right now but will have some specific items next week.\n\nI am taking over this highly complex integration that isn't working 100% as it should. 2 pages worth of workflows that are very intertwined and messy. I was looking to see if the way it was setup was best practice and to make sure before diving into that i am not burning a bunch of time in the wrong direction. A lot of the issues seems to be related to lead lifecycle stage and us having to sync based on the lead status field instead.\n\nI want to make sure I am setting everything up properly."

    "text": "Yeah lifecyclestage is a special property in HubSpot so I can see it causing issues. It was designed to only move forward and later got the ability to be wiped and reset to another part of the funnel.  I recommend to folks who know what they are doing to  set up separate property (sounds like you have done that) and general ignore lifecyclestage until you need to update for reporting purposes in HubSpot (to get that nice funnel visualization) but not rely on it for nurturing or anything like that"
