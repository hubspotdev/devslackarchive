It used to work fine, when making a call from a contact, it would open an iframe. After updating HubSpot, I noticed that when making a call, the iframe doesn't appear on the page and a strange bar is displayed instead. At the same time, all the handlers (onDialNumber) and the application js code itself works, according to the logs. Is this a HubSpot bug? And how can it be fixed?",
