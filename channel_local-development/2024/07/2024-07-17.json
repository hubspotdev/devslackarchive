    "text": "Hey all, I have this problem and I can't find how to fix it. I want to hs auth / hs init in my brand new local theme. It asks me to \"Open <http://HubSpot.com|HubSpot.com> to copy your personal access key? (Y/n)\" We choose Y so we can choose the account where we want the key to copy from. But the problem is that HubSpot opens the same account and I can't choose another. Normally you'll get the account overview where you choose the account you want to use.\n\nAnybody knows how to bypass this or use another command to hs auth / hs init based on account ID or something (no luck with hs auth --portal=XXXXXXXX)",
