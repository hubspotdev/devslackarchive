    "text": "&gt; is there any new information or updates on what HubSpot is doing internally to improve Core Vitals for CMS customers?\nWhile we are always actively working on improving performance - we are looking deep at every aspect of the performance equation to squeeze every ounce of speed out that we can.\n\nSpecific changes you may have already noticed:\n\nWe’ve been iterating on our <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate|theme boilerplate> to improve loading speeds for it. It consistently scores 90+ on Google page speed. Basically meaning if you manage to get below 90+ on Google Page speed it’s due to something you added on top of the boilerplate.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/browser-based-lazy-loading-now-available-for-module-image-field|Images, we’ve added lazy loading to image fields>.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/hubl-updates-for-speed-enhancement|enabled you to utilize performance enhancements with the require HubL  functions>.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/creating-a-related-post-listing|Updated the related blog post listing function so that you can trigger a JS callback ensuring faster load times>.\n\nWe automatically resize images that have `height` and `width` attributes. We automatically serve webp images when webp is a smaller file size and the device/browser supports it.\n\nWe minify all of your CSS and JS.\n\nUsing HubL you can combine your CSS or JavaScript files together using the include tag.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/cdn#browser-and-server-caching|Pages and files are cached> both on the server and browser level to ensure the quickest delivery of all page assets, when a page or dependency of the page changes we automatically expire the server cache for that page.\n\nWe automatically do <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/cdn#domain-rewriting|domain rewriting>.\n\nWe have an image editing functionality baked in so you can <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/cos-pages-editor/edit-an-image-in-HubSpot|resize/crop images> when adding them.\n\nWe provide you as a developer full control over the image resizing functionality, through `resize_image_url`, which you can use in your theme’s stylesheets and module.html\n\nWe dropped the requirement of jQuery meaning you don’t need to load that library at all for HubSpot functionality to work. For sites that were built using jQuery, we created a guide for <https://developers.HubSpot.com/cms/guides/jquery/upgrade|how to upgrade to the latest more efficient version of jQuery>.\n\nWhen using require_css or require_js your stylesheets and javascript are only loaded when that content is actually on the page. Similarly <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/files?hs_preview=cBfLAMOG-31121693267|module CSS and module JS only loads when the module is on the page>.\n\nAll assets are served via our worldwide CDN.\n\nWe encourage you to follow best practices by continually updating our <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/speed|developer documentation>, and encouraging fixing problems we find through the Code Alerts tool.\n\nHubSpot sites are served via HTTP2 with GZIP compression. All HubSpot hosted sites include IPv6 addresses.\n\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/cos-general/how-to-use-accelerated-mobile-pages-amp-in-HubSpot|HubSpot blogs support AMP>.\n\nCMS Hub Enterprise supports serverless functions, enabling you to retrieve data via APIs and dynamically update the front end without a page load, which can enable you to build single page apps.\n\nIn addition to make the experience of building single page apps faster/easier, we created a page with recommendations for how to work with them within CMS Hub. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/js-frameworks>\n\nAdditionally we created boilerplates for <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-vue-boilerplate|Vue> and <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react-boilerplate|React>.\n\nWe encouraged theme developers in the marketplace to build performant themes by through the recent <https://HubSpot.devpost.com/|theme challenge>, where one of the categories judging criteria was website performance.\n\nOn the back-end every week there are changes that make our platform more secure, reliable, and faster going out.\n\nWe are removing the “magic” where we can so you can build your own modules like menus and whatnot without relying on our code, then where we can <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/tree/main/src/modules/menu-section.module|we show you exactly how to do it using the boilerplate>.\n\nAdditionally we’ve integrated lighthouse into our website grader tool and are perpetually updating it to provide deeper and deeper insights.\n\nOur APIs also got a lot of improvements recently and other APIs are catching up  to also have those improvements. Improvements like supporting batching. Reducing API calls.\n\nWe released <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/overview|API clients> that make it easier to follow the best practices for using our APIs.\n\nSpeaking of APIs, we now have a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/cms/performance|CMS Performance API>.\n\nWe have numerous articles dating back years providing <https://developers.HubSpot.com/blog/12-tips-to-speed-up-your-website|tips to improving performance of your website>. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/blog/site-speed-and-performance-what-you-can-do-and-how-HubSpot-helps|Another one>, and <https://developers.HubSpot.com/blog/how-we-improved-page-speed-on-HubSpot.com|another one>.\n\nAside from the boilerplates, and the API clients being open source, we actively listen to all of you regarding performance and <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/A-place-to-gather-resources-issues-and-solutions-to-optimize/m-p/354462#M17516|have big community discussions>. Enabling us to learn from you, you to learn what resources and features we have, and for you to learn from other community members.\n\nIn not-so-short *we’re perpetually iterating and improving the whole platform from every angle for speed, and _we’re not slowing down._ Pun intended.*"
