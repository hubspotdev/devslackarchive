The issue is that the confirmation page is not recognizing user even though they just submitted form. Is there some way to ensure that on visit to a confirmation (post form submission) that it ensures recognizing visitor as known user. I understand if person came to page directly without submitting form. But I would think in all instances after form submission they would be known and that I could use personalization tokens to pull in content from contact record. Thoughts?",
