    "text": "Hey all, I have a GraphQL query that I think I misformatted or something? Wondering if anyone can help. Basically, I need to pull all objects that match property A *or* property B. The code I have now is set up like this:\n\n```(filter: {OR: {reservations_status__contains: \"CL\", reservations_status__contains: \"BK\"}},```\nwhich \"works\" - but it's only giving me result back and not all of them that match the query. Any idea how to change it to give all? Thanks!",
