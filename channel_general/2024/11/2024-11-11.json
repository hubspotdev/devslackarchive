    "text": "Dear Community Members, how are you?\nMy name is Hugo Salomon, and I'm the Product Manager for integrations at Aloware (CCaaS). As I am new to this community, I kindly ask for your patience and guidance, and I hope I am posting in the appropriate channel.\nWe have been experiencing an unusual issue with our in-app Dialer integration accessed via the Call Button in HubSpot. Recently, every time a call is completed and we attempt to return to last page or refresh the browser (in my case, Chrome), we encounter a \"Leave site?\" prompt, as illustrated in the attached image.\nI have searched the community for similar issues and found one discussion, but unfortunately, it did not provide a resolution ( <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C960Q64G4/p1569607081081200>). We would greatly appreciate any insights or solutions if others have encountered and addressed this problem. We have also noticed this behavior occurring in other browsers, and it appears to have started recently with our application.\nThank you in advance for your assistance.",
