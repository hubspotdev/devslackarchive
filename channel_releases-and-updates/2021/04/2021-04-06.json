If you're building an app that creates custom objects in multiple HubSpot accounts, then those accounts will need at least one Enterprise subscription. And, in this case, you do not need an Enterprise account to build.\n\nI hear you about the confusion. I will review the page and see where we can make improvements. This is great feedback! Thank you!"
