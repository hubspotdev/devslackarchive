I can use the contact api to get last marketing email, last marketing email open date and last marketing email click date and have these properties and properties with histories. I can get email name and send times easily, but matching the open and click date to the emails is going to be a bit more of a pain. Once I can do that. I can pivot based on email and send times. I can also then optimise based on open or click times"
