The update endpoint is the same way, if you try to update a list name to match another it will allow it as long as the other list is a different object type. (attached screenshot from UI)\n\nIn the UI if you try to create list with same name or edit a list name to match another there is an error and it won't allow you to make the change, doesn't matter the object type.\n\nIs the API create and update name a bug that will be changed to align with the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/api/crm/lists/overview#update-lists|documentation> or was this intended and the documentation wording needs to be updated?",
