I created webhook in app that will call my endpoint on one of deal property change\nwhat I don't know how to do is how to create test data for developer account. It seems webhook I created is only triggered when some data change in main account and I would like to avoid it.\nI don't have any UI menu option to do that.\n\nAny suggestions about this, how I could manage that this webhook only works with test data. I also considered workflow webhooks but it seems app webhooks are better option to my needs. I would need to get info whenever deal status data change.\n\nThanks"
