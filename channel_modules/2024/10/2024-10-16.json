    "text": "Hi all, this is my first time being here asking for help, not an exact developer, I'm an MKT Specialist who knows a tiny bit of coding.\n\nI'm creating a landing page with HubSpot and also trying to develop a \"looped logo carousel\" module. But after many attempts to configure it, there are still some issues, I hope you all can support me in archiving this.\n\nBelow it's the Module I've created combining HTML and CSS `(Code attached in the reply)`, even though this has met 80% of my expectations, but it did not loop properly, and I had to wait at least 20s for this carousel to restart from the beginning `(Video attached)`\n\nHopefully could seek some help here :D",
