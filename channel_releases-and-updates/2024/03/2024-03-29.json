    "text": ":mega: *Introducing New App Certification Submission Limits* :mega:\n\nWe are updating the app certification process for app partners for the App Marketplace.\n\n• *What is it?* Starting *March 29, 2024*, a new policy for the app certification submission process will take effect, limiting app partners to one submission at a time. \n• *Why does this matter?* This change aims to ensure fair access to certification resources and improve the review efficiency by HubSpot’s Ecosystem Quality Team. Once an app is certified, partners may submit another, but multiple simultaneous submissions will result in the cancellation of the excess in the order received. \nThis policy will help streamline the certification process, enhance review quality, and reduce redundant edits.\n\n*Read more about this update on our developer changelog.* \n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/introducing-new-app-certification-submission-limits|View the changelog> | <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Developer-Announcements/Introducing-New-App-Certification-Submission-Limits/m-p/951865#M663|Discuss on Community Forum>"

    "text": "Hello everyone,\nI found this article from 2022\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Releases-and-Updates/Now-Live-Associations-Limits-Increase/ba-p/631739>\nIt's talking about the CRM record association limit increase from 10k to 50k.\nI'm seeing a recent comment from <@U03AKL6Q1B2> asking for clarity about the limit for Contacts to Deals and she was answered with this\n```Presently, the 50k associations does not apply to contact-deal associations\n\n10,000 associated deals per contact\n1,000 associated contacts per deal, ticket, and engagement```\n<@U03AKL6Q1B2> do you happen to know if the current state of this upgrade is still the one stated here, which supposedly is the most up to date?\n<https://legal.HubSpot.com/HubSpot-product-and-services-catalog#TechnicalLimits:~:text=CRM%20Record%20Association%20Limits>\nThank you.",
