    "text": "another little side perk of doing this - almost every custom module we build is re-usable for other sites and layouts. \n\nFor example - say a client has a timeline module \n\n\nand another client wants almost the exact same type of functionality. Instead of copying and pasting bits of the code and having to make the module work with the new site’s structure. We litterally just clone the custom module to a new portal - all of the site specific styling(colors fonts, line styling etc.) is not stored in the custom module, just base styling is. So all we need to do is set the new colors and differences for the new client and we’re done. Makes something like this take 5-10 minutes instead of an hour.\n\nYou can get this same level of re-usability with a coded template if you keep your framework consistent, but it’s a little harder as you have to make sure you keep certain things consistent that HS isn’t doing for you right off the bat."
