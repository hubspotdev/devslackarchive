    "text": "Hello,\n\nI am using the HubSpot Batch API to update contact properties with a batch size of 50 contacts. However, I've encountered some strange behavior: some contact properties are getting updated as expected, while others are not.\n\nI understand that HubSpot does not update the \"update date\" if the incoming property value is the same as the existing one. However, in my case, the new values are different from the existing ones, so the properties should be updated. Despite this, some updates are not being applied.\n\nHere is the code Iâ€™m using:\n\nCould you provide any insights or suggestions on what might be causing this issue?\n```public function updateContactBatch(array $batchData): void\n{\n    $batchInputs = [];\n\n    foreach ($batchData as $data) {\n\n        if (null === $contact = $this-&gt;getContact($data['email'])) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        $properties = [\n            'example_property_one' =&gt; $data['example_value_one'],\n            'example_property_two' =&gt; $data['example_value_two'],\n            'example_property_three' =&gt; $data['example_value_three'],\n            'example_property_four' =&gt; $data['example_value_four'],\n            'example_property_five' =&gt; $data['example_value_five'],\n        ];\n\n        $updateObject = new SimplePublicObjectBatchInput([\n            'id' =&gt; $contact-&gt;getId(),\n            'properties' =&gt; $properties\n        ]);\n\n        $batchInputs[] = $updateObject;\n\n        sleep(1);\n    }\n\n    if (empty($batchInputs)) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    $batchInput = new BatchInputSimplePublicObjectBatchInput(['inputs' =&gt; $batchInputs]);\n    sleep(40);\n}```\nThank you"

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope you are doing well. We need assistance with an issue that has come up after we transitioned from using Hapikey (v2 version) to a Private App (v3 version) for our API calls. Since this change, we've had trouble tracking Google and Facebook leads in our HubSpot contacts list.\n\nPreviously, using [specific code], tracking for Google contacts worked correctly with the v2 version. However, after switching to the v3 version, the tracking no longer differentiates properly between Google and Facebook leads. Instead, [specific code] seems to aggregate contacts from both sources under a single filter in the HubSpot contacts list, specifically under the \"Original source drill-down 2\" filter option.\n\nCould you help us resolve this issue so that we can correctly track and differentiate leads coming from Google and Facebook separately, as we did before?\n\nYour prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance for your help and support.",
