I need the most help with HubSpot, understanding what blog feature ideas are easy to add or maybe hard to add. After that, I could use help implementing the design and features in HubSpot and the templates, etc.  This is a redesign, the blog already exists. I am based in NYC, localish is a plus but not a necessity.",
