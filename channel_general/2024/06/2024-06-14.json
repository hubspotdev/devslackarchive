If change the dep of jquery the CTA will function in private mode on firefox (our script won’t be loaded but the html will still have the a link with the redirect service for tracking.)\n\nYou could also look into proxying these scripts to your own domain so they won’t be blocked on firefox.\n\nOn our end, I’ll open an issue with that list to have content scripts from HubSpot removed from the blocklist though they have refused before.\n\nAnd I’ll speak with the CMS teams about automatically proxying scripts to the domain",
