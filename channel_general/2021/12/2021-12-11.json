I will get these in front of the team.\n\nIn the future you can use the feedback form at the bottom of the doc you’re on to provide any comments on the content.\n\nIf you think you’re running into a bug in the product, reaching out to support is the fastest way to get it resolved. We do watch the Slack and forums, but there are a lot of messages per day and unlike messaging support, it’s possible for something to get missed here.\n\nI’ll need to double check but I think the casing matters in some cases. Pun not intended."

    "text": "<@U7SL518D6> If by the casing matters in some cases, you mean for the types, that's ordinarily sort of true--- usually you use lowercase for primitives like string and integer--- but it's mostly a stylistic choice for documenters. Here, you guys have chosen to use all sentence-case, which is fine too, but the issue is that you're not consistent with it, even when using the same types, i.e. usually you have Integer, a couple of times you use integer; usually you have String, a couple of times you use string. The casing in these instances doesn't matter, for sure, it's most likely just the result of different developers / content editors working on the page at different times; but the cases should definitely be consistent, whichever paradigm you use--- that isn't to say you can't mix lower and upper case, I don't mean \"consistent\" in that regard, but consistent in which case you use for which types. If you're using String (capital) for the type, always use `String`, don't use `string` sometimes. And if you want to use `string`, that's great too, but you should always use `string` and not `String` sometimes then."

Whether it should or not is a different story (I’d argue in most cases we should make it so the developer doesn’t need to care about that).\n\nWill need to do some testing to verify lowercasing all of it will be fine before making that change.\n\nI hear you on the need for consistency on casing.\nI updated that page to use sentence case on the types as that seemed more prevalent. Will look into casing of values next week."

    "text": "Oh nice, you guys unlocked our ability to use the Spacing field in the content tab it looks like. I remember it gave an error saying you could only use it in the style groups before.\nMay I ask the reasoning behind not giving the ability to adjust margin left and right in the Spacing field though? To help prevent unknowingly breaking layouts? (iirc, it previously had the ability to modify left and right margins as well? But I could be mistaken.)\nI see the docs still say `Spacing fields can only be used as style fields.`  Hopefully I didn't just make you aware of a \"bug\" (us being able to use them outside of style fields now). :grimacing: If a developer really wants to add it as a non-style field (i.e. for repeaters?) I think they shouldn't be blocked from doing so, so hopefully it's not a bug.",
