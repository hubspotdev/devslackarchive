Now, I am looking for advice about how to save the content for each blog post.  Previously I saved all of the content into a HubDB and rendered the markup with Hubl.  Does anyone have experience or know the best practice when it comes to saving content for the blog posts?  Should each post be a separate JSON file.  Should I continue using HubDB?  Any advice appreciated."
