We need someone who is fluent in jquery, javascript hubl(obvs), HubDB and web best practices when it comes to site performance. I'd really like to be able to sit with this person for a day or two and go through some of the issues weve had to know how to change them for the future. Anyone able to help?"

    "text": "Hi - I’m brand-new to this Slack and I’ve been just starting to do some Dev work with HubSpot.\n\nMy first issue is this: I’m working with a HubSpot member who built pages about a year ago with a theme most of drag and drop templates. None of them are editable by code. Now, however, I do not seem to be able to add a new Drag and Drop template to a theme in my sandbox. It will only save in a folder or the root directory. In fact, there is only one place I even have the option to do a File, New and choose Drag and Drop template.  Are these being phased out? Is it best to use the HTML+HubL way? And, what do we do about the existing theme if we want to add templates?\n\nThank you!"
