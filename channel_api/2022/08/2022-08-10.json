They have mapped the properties and are posting the data to a URL which holds only the form. When submitting they are getting a 'Request Forbidden' response. Any ideas on how to fix this/manage it in a simpler way (I don't currently have CMS hub and am not sure if there are any IP restrictions)? Further to this is there a way to set up a key authorisation? Thanks!",

The goal is to identify if I was to switch one of our clients to enterprise, would we be able to more accurately unify our data across platforms using HubSpot as the source of truth.  The data would encompass website traffic, ppc, email, sales pipeline, and social data at minimum.  Currently the client has one brand domain and two active websites which is causing issues getting HubSpot data accurately represented in Google Data Studio among other softwares as well.  Below is the two questions I am seeking answers for.\n\n1. If we had two brand domains, does the api support brand data segmentation to google data studio and other PPC channels?\n2. What are the sources (lifecycle stages, contact properties, behavior events, etc) HubSpot APIs are using to delineate information (such as date) being sent to third party software?\n"
