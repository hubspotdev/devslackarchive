    "text": ":wave: Hi everyone! I am kicking the tires of HubSpot using the quickstart guide. Everything was going great until I got to the create webpage section. the guide states to navigate to the create dropdown in the upper right corner, and choose “website page” . I did that. then the guide states : on the next page select the ” my-website-theme if it is not already selected” I don’t see any way to select or if my-website theme has been selected. I see a pop up that has a form with two text elements one is prepopulated with a web address, and the other is asking for a page name. when I try to create a page it takes me to a template chooser, when what I want is to use the template that I uploaded. any help would be appreciated.thanks"
