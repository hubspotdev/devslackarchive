    "text": "ajlaporte: Sure, so firstly, I'm not sure if you're using the CTA as an embed code or in a template, but I was using mine as an embed. If you look at the code HS gives you, it has two script tags, one that loads a dependency and one that calls a function. The way the embed code works is it gives you a linked image first (I'm guessing mainly for email purposes) then once the dependency loads, the second script function replaces the image with the normal CTA markup (text, divs, etc).\n\nI was trying to consolidate the script tags for my use case, so the second script tag function was firing without the HS-hosted dependency and I was getting an error similar to \"function hbspt not defined\"\n\nI'd assume CTAs work the same way if embedded natively, but I'm not 100% sure. I'd just check for JS errors first in diagnosing the issue."
