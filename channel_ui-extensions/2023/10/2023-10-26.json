I just need to easily visualise my :sparkles: vision :sparkles: for them. Also, the more we develop extensions, the more requests we get from outside of the admin competency. Being able to quickly sketch it out in a UI/UX tool would make this process smoother and allow us to align quicker. Happy to jump on a call if needed."

    "text": "Hi all, I’m having issues creating associations between objects using a serverless function. It works when developing locally, however when I push the project changes to the portal I get this error:\n```\"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'basicApi')\"```\nThis happens when I attempt to associate objects together using the NodeJS client like so:\n```await HubSpotClient.crm.associations.v4.basicApi.create(\n        'quotes',\n        quoteResponse.id,\n        'deals',\n        dealId,\n        [\n            {\n                \"associationCategory\": \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n                \"associationTypeId\": 64\n            }\n        ]\n    )   ```\nMy original approach was to include the association in the record creation, which again works in local dev. However the record is created and the association is ignored when I send the request once the project is uploaded.\n\nAnybody have any ideas?",
