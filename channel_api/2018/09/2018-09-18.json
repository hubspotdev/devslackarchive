Looking for conversion rate per placement and was hoping to be able to calculate leads per placement which HS only does currently as an overall vs per cta placement.\n\nAm I missing the right place to look or is there just not much available. Any chance this data will open up?\n\nI saw at partner day there are 3 team members now dedicated to dev support. Does anyone know  to reach them or if they would be the right people to reach out for an API question like that."
