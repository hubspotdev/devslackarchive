    "text": "Hi all! A Marketer here (not a developer) - I'm seeking a partner to help us build a few dynamic pages. Our current partner helping us with migration/onboarding mentioned they couldn't do it because of the theme we have installed. I'm trying to avoid creating duplicate pages and I'd like having a few fields change depending on where people click (also having separate URLs for each page). I am not sure what the best solution would be for this. Building a new module? Coding the pages? Adding a new theme? Any guidance or leads on partners who could help would be most appreciated. Husbpot support recommended I asked here :slightly_smiling_face:",
