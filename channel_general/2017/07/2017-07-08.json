    "text": "Just throwing this out there to share with this community.  I created a proof of concept site that allows me to take the content from a wordpress page (inside the &lt;article&gt;&lt;/article&gt; tags).  The current site I have uploaded takes three urls of wordpress sites I found / knew of and creates HubSpot Pages in the HS demo site.  Once the three pages load and do some explaining of what is going on and debugging so you can see how it works, it provides a form so you can paste in another wordpress page url to see how it work on that page"
