    "text": "Hey - just a design manager user experience question :) I’m building a template for the marketplace and was looking for some feedback!\n\nI’m just putting together the footer - and I’m at a bit of a crossroads.\n\nThe way I see it there are a couple of options:\n\n1. Use a menu per column and build the footer out in HS columns - the obvious advantage here is it’s a much more visual build-out process - allowing designers to drag, drop, delete and resize columns (and put anything they want in them)\n2. Create a custom module with repeaters and allow user to link one menu, which then splits the menu by the parents and distributes them across columns. Obviously this isn’t a very visual way, and it’s limited in flexibility. Although, it just requires one menu for the footer.\n3. Or just setup a repeater, with no menu\nNot sure if this makes much sense, but below is how I wanted to do it, but is setting up a menu per column a bit excessive? Feedback would be much appreciated!\n\nObviously the second one would just be a custom module with a couple of fields.\n\nThanks! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n_repeats to self: “perfection does not exist, just finish the bloomin’ thing”_",
