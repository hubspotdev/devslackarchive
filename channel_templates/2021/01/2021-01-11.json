This was not happening in PC.\nAnother thing that I noticed is that now I need to use “*npx* hs watch local-folder hubs-theme-folder”\nIn PC I just used HS without NPX … Could you please help me figured out if I something wrong here? Thanks."

I  can see that `{{content_name}}`  is used in the blog post template, but I would like to use that in a custom module in my blog template - is that possible? If not, is it possible to customize the blog content module locally in a way?",

Our company has about 4 blog interfaces, but all the tags appear in all the posts editors, so, we need to divide the tags appearing on each posts editor based on the blog. Does that makes sense? Is that possible? Any idea?\nIf that is not possible, I was thinking about creating a field with the options I need on every blog, and based on the selection, add programmatically the tags to the post, but, I haven't found a way to do it.",
