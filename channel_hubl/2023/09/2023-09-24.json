    "text": "Hey guys!\n\nI am new to HubSpot development process. I have a html and css template. The CSS file is using pure css variables to have centralized control of colors in the theme. Now, how can I connect those css variables with HubSpot theme CMS color settings so that if anyone changes the theme colors results those colors to be implemented on the theme. And by default there should be same color used initially. \n\nI would appreciate if someone could show where and in which file need to be updated with what color. One example of color used in my theme is :\n:root {\n --color-primary : #4285F4;\n--color-secondary: #FF5733;\n}\n\nNow, I want to replace these hex values with theme color variables and keep hex values as default.\n\nThank you in advance!",
