I've worked fairly extensively with Timber in WordPress and Twig in Craft CMS (as well as using templating languages in JavaScript), but I'm still trying to get my head around appropriate architectures for a fully fledged HubSpot site at the moment.\n\nHas anyone got any top tips or \"aha\" moments will make wading through the docs a bit easier?",
