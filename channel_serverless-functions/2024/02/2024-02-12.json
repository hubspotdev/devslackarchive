When \"developing locally\" the `ui-extension` works great EXCEPT for calling the local `serverless-function` that is part of the project/extension.    The only error in the console is a 403.\n\nIs it possible to test both the `ui-extension` and the `serverless-function` locally?  or do I need to upload every change and test in staging (gross)?",
