    "text": "Let me be more specific. This is a mailing address change form.\n1. User goes to the page with the form. If we don't see the cookie, we show a HS form with just an email address field. That form fires off a workflow that sends an email saying, \"Click Here to Update Your Address\" - the assumption being the clicking of that link would now identify them in their browser, and we then display the form, populated with their info\n2. This almost works. However the user is identified immediately after submitting the form. So just a page refresh populates the form, which we don't want. We are thinking of just having our own form, not a HS form, submit to the HS form through the API to avoid setting the cookie at that stage"
