    "text": "Hello Creators,\n\nI need quick help. I have a language switcher dropdown in my header. Now I want Automatic Redirect Based on Browser Language. Please share relevant js code related this.\n\nWhat I need is the possibility to redirect visitors to the appropriate language of my page. So if my browser is set to German language and I visit my site, I am automatically redirected to the German <https://www.example.com/de/> site. If the browser settings are set to the English language, the visitor is automatically redirected to the <https://www.example.com/en>\n\nI have tried this but there is no luck.\n\n       &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n    $( document ).ready(function(){\n        var userLang = navigator.language || navigator.userLanguage;\n        if (userLang == \"de\") {\n           window.location.href = \"<https://www.example.com/de/>\"\n        }\n\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThanks in Advanced."
