    "text": "Hello fellow developers,\n\nWe’re currently facing challenges in establishing an efficient method to create image galleries (multiple images) for each property type, corresponding to each row in the “Main Property Table.” While one approach could involve creating multiple tables and using them as child tables, this approach isn’t practical due to the large number of rows, exceeding hundreds.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate your assistance in finding a viable solution to this issue. Thank you for your support.\nThank you!"
