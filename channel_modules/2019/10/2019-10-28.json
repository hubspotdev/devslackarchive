    "text": "so in this case, if the client chooses the tag _*People &amp; News*_, then HubSpot returns `people-news`. There is no way for me to use a `|replace()` filter because of the special character – `&amp;`. I could loop through the entire list of blog tags, put a condition to match the slugs together, and then return a name that way… But that seems like overkill to output a tag name from a blog, especially  if the module option is to return a tag _name_, not _slug_"
