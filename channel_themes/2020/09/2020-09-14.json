I thought my Hubl should look like this, but I am only getting errors:\n```{% module \"interior_banner_hero\" path=\"../modules/Interior Banner Hero - MojoFlex\", \n    label=\"Interior Banner Hero - MojoFlex\",\n    background_options=[\n      {\n       'background_image': {\n        'src': get_asset_url('../images/interior-skyline-banner.jpg'),\n        'alt': 'Some Text'\n       }\n      }\n    ]\n  %}```"

    "text": "Hey <@U89DUQGKD>, I happened to get your support ticket internally and thought I’d follow up here to make things quicker/close the loop on this thread. You can use the following for your example:\n```     {% dnd_module \n          path='/MojoFlex/modules/Homepage Feature Hero - MojoFlex',\n          label='Homepage Feature Hero - MojoFlex',\n          background_image={\n            'src': get_asset_url('/MojoFlex/images/interior-banners/interior-skyline-banner.jpg'),\n            'alt': 'City Skyline',\n            'size_type': 'auto'\n          }\n          %}\n        {% end_dnd_module %}```\nFor individual fields (not in groups) you can set default content by using each field as an attribute in the dnd_module tag, and you can omit any field you don’t want to set default content for. You only need the array for module groups or groups with repeaters. If your background_image field were in a group called bg_group with repeaters, that could look like this:\n```bg_group=[\n      {\n       background_image={\n            'src': 'image_1.jpg',\n            'alt': 'alt text for bg image 1',\n            'size_type': 'size1'\n          }\n    },\n    {\n      background_image={\n            'src': 'different_image.jpg',\n            'alt': 'Alt text for image 2',\n            'size_type': 'size2'\n          }\n       }\n  ]```\n"
