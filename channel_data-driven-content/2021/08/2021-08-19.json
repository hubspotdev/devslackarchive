    "text": "<@U795QFHDE> At a quick glance it is mainly looking like youre not appending a string to categories. And I dont think that that comma is needed either. So maybe change that third to last line to:\n\n`{% do categories.append(\"Auto Body\") %}`\n\nAlso services isnt defined here. Im assuming its a column in the Row? If it is then you will need to access it in the for loop using `row.services` . It is likely that your services statement is currently not passing every time."
