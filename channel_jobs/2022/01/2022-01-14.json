We're thoughtful in our consultative engagements and focus on selling the right thing (and not \"all the things\").\n\nIf this resonates with someone you may know, I'd love to have an exploratory conversation. Please send them my way or they can message me directly at <mailto:tsenesi@newbreedmarketing.com|tsenesi@newbreedmarketing.com>.  Thanks!"
