    "text": "Hi all!\n\nI have a problem understanding the functionality of the forms API. My goal is to manipulate the order of fields included in a form. I know, that the order is usually influenced by the order the fields are written in the JSON you send via the API. But in the API documentation it also says, that the key \"displayOrder\" will have an influence on this. I tried using this property to manipulate the order fields will be displayed in, but it has no effect, when updating or creating a new form. Can anybody tell me, what I am doing wrong? Thank you :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nCheers Andi\n```          \"displayOrder\": -1,\n          // Integer; The order to display the fields in.\n          //If the values are negative, the fields appear in the order they appear in the 'fields' list```\n",
