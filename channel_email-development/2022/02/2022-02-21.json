Is there any chance you could point me in the right direction or forward me something to pass on for my support ticket?"

    "text": "Hi Simon! Unfortunately, I no longer work in Support- I work in a different department now- so I don't have not kept up if this issue has re-opened, if it's a new issue, etc. My work these days has been focused on the sending network, rather than the tool. If you've opened a Support ticket and they've not been able to find an answer, provide them with as many examples as possible - screenshots or videos is always helpful. I apologize, I wish I could be more helpful!\n\nYou could always post a new post here and perhaps one of our dev support members can check into it for you. :)"
