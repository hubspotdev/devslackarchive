I'm a Product Manager here at HubSpot, and we are looking to improve the current experience with Module Categories in the Pages and Blog editors (which split modules into categories such as text, media, design, etc). If you have feedback and suggestions, please drop them in the :thread: ! Thank you in advance :slightly_smiling_face:",

    "text": "While the act of dragging a module or section hides the columns, the significant width they consume can create a sense of insufficient space for some users. It might be beneficial if the width of the second column could be reduced, and the third column displayed only icons, with a tooltip revealing the name, similar to the practice with the first column. This approach could potentially occupy less space and alleviate this concern. Please see the attached image for an example of the suggested layout.",
