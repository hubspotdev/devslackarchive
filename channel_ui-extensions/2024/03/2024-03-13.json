I have a potential CRM card use case that would involve serverless function, but curious if you guys can shed some light on what/where I should start.\n\n*Use case: an user-editable table with fixed table headers.*\nUser can add a row and enter input (free text), and can edit existing rows. Ideally user can remove a row but not so important for the first iterations.\n\nBasically like simplified excel sheet. Doesn’t matter for end users where we host the input backend - they don’t need to live in a property etc.",
