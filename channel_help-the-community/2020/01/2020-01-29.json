    "text": "Hi Juan, we currently do not have official documentation for using Vue with HubSpot. We do see how it would be really helpful. In the meantime we have a <#CM9UXHWKH|js-frameworks-in-HubSpot-cms> channel\n\nIn there occasionally people post tips and tricks and build processes theyâ€™ve worked out. We love hearing how developers are currently integrating javascript frameworks with HubSpot, as it helps us improve to better support more complex needs."

But, I'm curious on how I can turn on this functionality for certain templates. I realize this view may still be in beta and not yet have documentation, but would love to hear that it does!",
