There are different ways you can do this, for example if you want to pull a new lead details soon after it is created in HubSpot, you jave to use HubSpot webhooks or workflows(depends on the customer subscription). \n\nIf you go through HubSpot documentation on using the API to pull contact data or using the webhooks you will quickly acheive this on your own.\n\nI can help you if you need urgent quick help and do not have time to go through the documentation.\n\nThanks"

In reading the api docs at <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts> it doesn't seem like we can update Contacts by email... is that only available in the `v1` api? Also, is there any sort of \"upsert\"-style functionality, or do we have to be specific in the call? In that case, in `v3` search can we specify multiple email addresses as filters to get functionality like SQL `IN` somehow? The documentation for `v3` search is very nice in exposing the expected body structure but it is not immediately clear to me what all of the parameters accomplish.
