They are inquiring about why their google recaptcha is not filtering spam.\n\nI found an article about enabling the recaptcha on the formbuilder; is it truly as simple as toggling a button? or will the client need to create an API key through recaptcha and provide that key somewhere in the HubSpot backend/account info?",
