    "text": "Hi - I mostly work with the CRM components of HubSpot and less with themes/front end, but am trying to figure out how to add a page break before a section in our quote template. I <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Quote-Custom-template-break-page/m-p/414054|found a great thread about others that have been able to do this with CSS>, but I'm not as well versed in CSS or HubSpot themes to understand the implication of editing it or creating a child theme. Can I create a child theme that just the quote template uses? I'll likely outsource someone adding it, but want to be sure I give adequate direction. Any general thoughts would be helpful. Thanks in advance!!",
