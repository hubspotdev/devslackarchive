We review templates/modules out of a queue with the oldest templates/modules being reviewed first. The typical time for a module/template to be reviewed is around 2 weeks but this can vary based on volume submitted. Once your module has been reviewed you'll get an email to your provider contact email address either letting you know your module was approved or with a list of required fixes."

    "text": "I'd generally say that most templates use default modules where appropriate (without cloning). So for example, for a simple section with text a rich text module would likely be used. Then for anything that you can't accomplish with a standard module a custom module would be created (e.g. accordion, tabber, pricing table). If you're looking to get a sense for what other developers are doing there are also quite a few free templates on the marketplace that you could download and check out to get a sense of what people are using. Hope that helps :thumbsup:"
