Feel free to ask questions in Issues. If something interests you but the issue’s message was vague, just ask and it can be clarified. You’re not alone, if you have questions about how the extension works so you can do your thing, just ask. I watch the issues and I am on Slack way too much\n\n<https://github.com/williamspiro/HubSpot-Developer-Extension/labels/Hacktoberfest>"
