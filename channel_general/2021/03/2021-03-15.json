    "text": "Hi all.  I wasn’t sure where to put this query, so hopefully the general channel is the right place…  I’d like to create a custom property that consists of two nested properties (a dropdown, and a number field).  Is there a way to achieve this?  If anyone knows of any apps on the marketplace that may be able to help me, or if there’s a way of being able to implement this myself, then some guidance will be greatly appreciated!  Thanks in advance."
