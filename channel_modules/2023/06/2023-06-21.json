    "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm reaching out to discuss an issue with broken links on our website's SEO. I have been attempting to locate these broken links on the relevant pages to edit or delete them, but I have not found them.\n\n<https://app.HubSpot.com/content-strategy/14494438/recommendations/domain/1018101/hostname/1547300/category/USER_EXPERIENCE/type/FIX_BROKEN_INTERNAL_LINKS>\n\nMy HubSpot account: is 14494438\n\nAfter careful analysis, I suspect that the problem may be related to pagination. I have attached a screenshot for you to understand the situation better.\n\nWe previously attempted to address this matter through a chat conversation, a HubSpot consultant, and a support call, but unfortunately, we did not receive a satisfactory response. Finally, they suggested your genius developers team resolve this issue questions.\n\nWe greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide in resolving this issue. Please let us know if there is a suitable time for a call or if there are alternative solutions we should explore.\n\nPS Our communication can be in English or French if you prefer.\n\nThank you in advance for your attention. :-)\n\nKind regards,\n\nSandra Saad",
