    "text": "Hey,\n\n*Feature request:*\nCan we please get the option to vertically align the `TableCell` component?\nWhen building complex data tables, this is a big limitation.\n\nCurrent workaround is to build out the table using flex box, but using this approach you are not able to get the horizontal scroll on smaller screens, which just makes the extension unusable if it contains more than 2-3 columns.\n\nThanks!\n\nping <@U03FJQPSC0Y>",
