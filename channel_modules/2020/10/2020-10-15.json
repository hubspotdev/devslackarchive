    "text": "Hi guys,\n\nWe've created a custom module and would like to set some field values for that module from a html_HUbL template. I'm kind of stuck at this as I couldn't find any documentation about it.\n\nThis is how you get to the options in the VIsual Editor: <https://d.pr/v/p7GVUj>\nBasically Module-&gt; Styles -&gt; Background -&gt; Background Image . In the module this is the path to the setting that we use:\n`module.styles.background.background_image.src`\n\nSo this is the code we've been using in order to set the background image from the html+HubL template:\n`{% dnd_module path='../modules/ab-hero-section.module',`\n            `content_alignment='center',`\n            `headline = 'Powerful software to run and grow your landscape business',`\n            `subheadline = 'Cut your costs. Boost your profit. Scale your business to $10 Million and beyond.',`\n            `\"styles\" : {`\n              \n              `\"background\" : {`\n              \n                `\"background_image\" : {`\n                    `\"default\" : {`\n                      `\"src\" : \"{{ get_asset_url('../images/your-image.jpg') }}\",`\n                      `\"alt\" : \"TEST\",`\n                      `\"width\" : \"1440\",`\n                      `\"height\" : \"683\"`\n                  `}`\n\n                `}`\n                  \n                \n              `}`    \n            `}` \n`%}`\n\nCould anyone help with some guidance here please? We've been stuck here for quite a while and couldn't find any helpful documentation for this yet",
