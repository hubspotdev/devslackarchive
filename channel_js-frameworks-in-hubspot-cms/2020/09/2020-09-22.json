If I just upload built app, opening index.html will not display anything without running 'npm start'  (but I suppose I can use it only when working locally). How to deploy React App build properly?",

    "text": "You might want to take a look at <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-event-registration>\n\nIn short you need build your JS sources and create a <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-event-registration/tree/master/src/modules|HubSpot module> which <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-event-registration/blob/master/src/modules/upcoming-events.module/module.html#L2-L3|includes your built scripts> and some <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-event-registration/blob/master/src/UpcomingEvents.js#L35-L53|non-react code to render the react app> to <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-event-registration/blob/master/src/modules/upcoming-events.module/module.html#L14-L22|an element in the module html>.\n\nSo what you upload to HubSpot should be a folder called `yourapp.module` which contains files `fields.json`, `meta.json` , and `module.html` , and the React app in some way.\n\nWe have pretty small React modules,  so we've built the whole app to be the `module.js` and include the vendor bundle that webpack puts together in the modules `meta.json` like `\"js_assets\": [{ \"path\": \"/my-theme/js/vendors.js\" }]`"
