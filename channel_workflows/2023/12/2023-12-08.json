However, I am not able to *PIN the Note* to keep it on the top. Is it possible by passing some property value to pin the note? Also, the property `hs_note_body` only takes string. So, there isn't any way to format the string like bold or something and also insert links and owner details in it?\nIf the above is not possible, is there a way atleast to comment in the Note?\nAny help would be much appreciated!\nThanks!",
