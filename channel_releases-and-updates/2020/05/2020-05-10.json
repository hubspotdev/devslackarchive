    "text": "Sorry for a delayed response, no at this time `hs watch` does not work with `filemanager` .That said `watch` is mostly used for active development, itâ€™s less likely you would need that kind of uploading. Especially given that the Design manager supports uploading a lot of different assets like many image formats.\n\nIf you have say an image optimization script going, and you want your images stored in the file manager vs the design manager, I would set the script to optimize then upload the folder containing the images after. This would avoid uploading the same image multiple times."
