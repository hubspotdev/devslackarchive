    "text": "Hi Jon, thanks for the update!\n\nI'm thinking that UI tweaks like this should maybe be a toggle? Just to avoid any confusion about whether the UI was changed by the extension or by HubSpot. If I hadn't seen your message I would have probably thought it was an official HS update :smile: \n\nAnyways, just a thought :slightly_smiling_face: Loving the extension btw, the Debug Mode/Bust Cache shortcuts already saved me a lot of typing!"

    "text": "I wholeheartedly agree on the toggle, Gonzalo and I have talked about basically doing toggles for any UI changes. I will make sure a toggle to turn on all UI tweaks is added in the next major update. (This will mean everyone who currently has this tweak, will have to re-enable it if they want it) I generally personally prefer “opt-in” over “opt-out” for things.\n\nCurrently this toggle would control two tweaks we make to the UI(for Mac Users we invert your cursor when hovering over the code editor[on mac the cursor shows black on a dark background, which is hard to see], It would also toggle this get help and revert button tweak.)\nThis toggle would have no effect on the dark theme, so you can use the dark theme without the UI tweaks.\n\nGlad you’re loving the extension!\nIf you don’t mind rating/reviewing it we’d appreciate it! Ratings and reviews boost the extensions visibility"
