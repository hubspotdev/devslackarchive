    "text": "<@U07U8CE4W3S>\nOkay so to put it simple you just want Accounts and Deals from Company ABC to be associated to each other? right?\n\nIdea:\nOkay so if both Accounts and Deals should only interact with each other/be associate to each other when they are associated to Company ABC then you could fill a custom property on the Deal and the Account and fill this property with a unique value (for example record id) whenever on of them gets associated to the Company\n\nso a deal/account gets associated to the company and you then for example copy the Record ID of the company to the objects\n\nthen you have a workflow deal+account based with custom property is known as trigger then  delay (so property can be populated on both ends) and then have -&gt; create association action block based on the custom property where the record id of the company is stored\n\nthere is still a lot of things open since you always describe your topic very shortly -&gt; if there are multiple deals and multiple accounts on one company should they be different? does it matter? or should everything be associated to everything, when a deal/account is associated to the company?"
