    "text": "Surely! And of course, I'm really sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nThe issue was due to a new built-in property on HubDB rows we rolled out called `publishedAt` , which tracks when a given row was published. There was a delay between when we rolled the change out, and when our renderer was able to use it. When our renderer tried to parse the new column, exceptions were thrown internally and caused HubDB related content to fail the rendering process.\n\nAll that to say, it was a brief outage between HubDB and the CMS itself, nothing specific to you client's hub. We've implemented changes today that will ensure something like this doesn't happen moving forward!"
