I am further away from where I was before when I try that approach as neither of the \"drop modules here\" boxes are now rendering on my page.\n\nAs I said, I'm extending a base.html layout here with {% extends \"./layouts/base.html\" %} at the top of my page.html template.  Given, this maybe I need to include something in base.html so that the code in page.html can be read?\n\nAnd yeah I do have layouts_.css included"
