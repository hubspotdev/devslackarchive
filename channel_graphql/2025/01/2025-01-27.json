    "text": "Is this possibly a bug or am I missing something?\n\nI know filters separated by comma act as AND, which works fine until I have multiple “OR: [ ]” filters. Seems like the second “OR: [ ]” filter disregards the AND logic and creates OR logic between the two “OR: [ ]” filters. Tried wrapping them in inside of “AND: [ ]” but getting validation errors, so I don’t think that is a thing in HubSpot’s graphiQL.",
