    "text": "Hey hey :wave: wondering how everyone is handling <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/resources/what-are-the-submission-requirements-for-the-template-marketplace#1-4|this Marketplace guideline> regarding 3rd party asset loading in Themes: \"...If an external CDN version of a library is included, a local copy must be provided as a fallback.\" I'm thinking of doing something like this (below) but is this best practice? Is there a slicker, perhaps more HubL-y way to handle this?:\n\n```{# AOS #}\n{{ require_js(\"<https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.js>\") }}\n...\n...\n{{ standard_footer_includes }}\n{% require_js %}\n  &lt;script&gt;\n    if(!AOS) { \n      ..load local copy\n    }\n  &lt;/script&gt;\n{% end_require_js %} ```\n"
