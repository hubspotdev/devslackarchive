It may take several minutes to several hours for the validation to process since it has to go through Google's flow of scheduling and processing. However, you can also use <https://search.google.com/test/amp> on a per-URL basis to test out the affected pages and confirm that the enqueued recrawl should resolve the issue inside of GSC."
