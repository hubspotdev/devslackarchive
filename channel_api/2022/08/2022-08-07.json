    "text": "Hi everyone! I am trying to authenticate my private app with Oauth2 so that I can query the Brightspace D2L api and I am struggling. So far I have set up the private app with the serverless.json configured with all of my secrets and variables. What I can't seem to figure out is how to call the auth URL and programmatically input my credentials to return the authorization token. I have been trying all the oauth quickstart guides, but they all leave out how to do this without the manual step of entering the username and password. Any help or even general points in the right direction would be very much appreciated. Attaching a screenshot of basically the only part I have working so far for reference.",
