Also makes our modules more easily transferrable to other HS-Sites. \n\nI realize that to fix it in my case I can just namespace my variable or something but really the HS variables should atleast be namesspaced like hs_class_name or something, as it’s too easy to unintentionally cause problems.\n\n<https://spin.d.pr/nh0Fs6+>"
