I am working on a CMS project and will need to do so.\n\nMy thinking was that I would there could be a HS serverless function that would poll the PIM for product data and land it into a HubDB or Custom CRM Objects at some interval or in response to a webhook.\n\nAnything you can share would be much appreciated!"

    "text": "<@U02HC26T2M8> that sounds like a good idea! What I ended up doing was a bit simpler than that: I just made a little express.js app with a few different endpoints that get triggered in a specific order via a nightly cron job. Updates the hubdb table existing rows, adds new rows, and deletes rows. Pretty basic but it's been working without any downtime for a couple years now so i'm pretty happy with it."
