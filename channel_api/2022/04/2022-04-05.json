This happens even though we rate limit based on the following HTTP response headers:\n• `x-HubSpot-ratelimit-interval-milliseconds`\n• `x-HubSpot-ratelimit-max`\nWe use API keys directly and for professional plans the limit should be 150 requests per 10 seconds and although we stayed conservative with 130 or 140 for 10 seconds, we still hit those errors. Empirically we found 40 requests per 10 seconds to kind of work. Does anyone know anything about this?\nThanks! :v:",
