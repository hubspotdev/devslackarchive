    "text": ":rocket: *[Log Tracing for UI Extensions in Public Beta]*\n\nHi all - it's official! We've just launched the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/log-tracing-for-ui-extension-development|Log Tracing feature> for UI extensions with private apps. Customers can now connect all front-end React logs and back-end serverless function logs with a single Trace ID and view the full log trace in the '*Log Traces'* tab in the CRM Development page. We've also added the *'Extensions'* and '*Serverless functions'* tabs for customers to view comprehensive React and serverless log statements, copy the Trace ID, and open the relevant log trace. Please refer to the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/log-tracing-for-ui-extension-development|Changelog announcement> to learn more.\n\nWe'll continue to provide more impactful observability features for customers, so please stay tuned!\n\n*Changelog announcement:* <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/log-tracing-for-ui-extension-development>"
