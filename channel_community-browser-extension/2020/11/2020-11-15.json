You can connect to the HubSpot app with your app to communicate to your accounts (with the app installed.)\n\ne.g:\n• set up HubSpot app to fire webhooks \n• Have the app on your end receive webhooks\nSo you don't need to concern youself with what language you need, it's your choice. You just need to use the HubSpot API."
