They want to use api when submit data to a form: <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form_v3_authentication#:~:text=As%20this%20API%20is%20authenticated%2C> I want to create a private app, read docs and everything is clear except one thing. I need to define permissions (scopes) for private app. When we use token we want to be sure that we have only permission to work with email forms. Does anyone have experience with choosing permission only for submit data to a form ?"

You can try to make an API call using the hapi key and see if it fails (I assume that it will fail). If it fails you have your answer (other integrations are failing as well). If it doesn't fail you can try two things:\n• Go to this page (put rour portal id): <https://app.HubSpot.com/api-key/your_portal_id/call-log> (if the page from your screenshot isn't this one)\n• Try to make an API call with your hapi key: <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/check-daily-api-usage>\n    ◦ curl --location --request GET '<https://api.hubapi.com/integrations/v1/limit/daily?hapikey=your_hapi_key>'\nNote: Company I work for asked for an extension and our deadline is Feb 2023 thus I cannot check it myself."
