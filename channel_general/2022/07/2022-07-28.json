It had two options \"_Resend registration email_\" and \"_reset password_\". As of today we lost the \"_resend registration email\"_ option and only have the \"_reset password\"_ option. Some contacts have entirely lost the \"_manage registration\"_ button as well. Any idea what might be causing this?",

Javascript should then only respond to click events on the `.card` wrapper.\n```.card.with-cta * {\n  pointer-events: none;\n}```\n*Step7*\nAnd the optional reset for no-script support:\n```{% require_css %}\n&lt;noscript&gt;\n  &lt;style&gt;\n    .card.with-cta * {\n      pointer-events: auto;\n    }\n  &lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/noscript&gt;\n{% end_require_css %}```"

    "text": "The other case that you described is only relevant when you have different link targets. That means link elements are layered. Then the highest element in the hierarchy will be executed when clicked. That should work out of the box.\n\nBut be careful with nesting linked elements. Better keep them as a single layer and format them with CSS. Example, could be a popup with a background overlay. The popup has clickable element in the content. Like a form _submit_ or close _button_. But we want also that, when the user click aside the popup, that the popup get closed. For that we add a transparent layer, the `overlay`, an use it as a target for the JavaScript.\n\n*... so don't do that:*\n```&lt;div class=\"popup\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"overlay\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;(...)&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt; ```\n*...this is much better:*\n```&lt;div class=\"popup\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"overlay\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;(...)&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;```\n"
