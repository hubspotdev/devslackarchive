    "text": "I have a question about themes and child themes (sortof).  We have purchased the POWER theme and it uses a module in the footer for footer contents.  This works fine for all the main pages where you can open a page in the editor &gt; click on the footer &gt; edit the module in the global footer screen.  But how do I get to that same module in the system templates?  If you click on edit for a system template you are in template code.  Is there a way to get to the footer module for system templates?  Or is this an unfortunate way to set up a footer?  (I can create a child footer and change the code to show the same footer for both pages and system pages but thought I’d see if I was missing something obvious first).  I’ve attached a sample of the footer, you can see the multiple module calls based on the type of page you are in.",
