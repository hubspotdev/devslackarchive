Though it might be tricky to implement, because it is key to avoid calls that force the rendering of the element you've marked with content-visibility ( like the element's layout, dimensions, or content)."

    "text": "According to Gemini, there are those Drawbacks to using content-visibility:\n\n```Drawbacks:\n\nPotential Performance Impact:  While content-visibility improves layout, it might introduce a slight delay when the form becomes visible. This is because the browser needs to render the form when it's triggered.\n\nConditional Logic in Workflows: HubSpot workflows rely on form field values to trigger actions. If you hide form fields with content-visibility, you might need to adjust your workflows to account for the initial hidden state. ```"

    "text": "Interesting:  According to Gemini, there should be built-in options in HubSpot to help with this?\n\n``` HubSpot Form Settings: HubSpot forms offer built-in options to control their appearance. You can explore options like progressive rendering or modal popups to minimize layout shifts.  ```"
