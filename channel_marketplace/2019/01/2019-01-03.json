    "text": "You can do the inlining on HubSpot instead too but I’ve found it to be a little troublesome having HubSpot inline it all sometimes. I think it’s because HubSpot doesn’t by default know what to do with the media queries,since they can’t be inlined. You can work around this by having all of the media queries in a separate &lt;style&gt; and all the stuff you want inlined in the inline &lt;style&gt; element with the data inliner attribute"
