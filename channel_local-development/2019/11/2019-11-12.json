(Only thing missing is a local server and local content as JSON w/tooling to sync)\nWe had a look at our own existing prod portal, where we got a bounch of \"old style\" JSON template files. Then we had a look at the CMS boilerplate stuff, which is pure \"dnd\". Will you champion dnd as the future, or will both methods be equally prioritized? Seems to me the dnd is the better option?"
