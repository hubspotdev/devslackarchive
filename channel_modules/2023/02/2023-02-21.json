    "text": "This is an old post, but we're still experiencing unexpected behavior.\n{{ name }} behaves differently depending if you are manually 'dragging and dropping' it onto a page VS declaring/creating it in a template.\n\nIf we have a template where we have defined a module that has a div with an id made with {{name}} it gets the id \"dnd_area-module-2\". If we drag and drop the same module into the page it will get an id like \"widget_1676970114818\". The latter is dynamic, the first is ~static~. This utterly breaks any dynamic (js) approach we have for that module when the module is made via a template. Edit: Main issue is that the one generated via template is using \"-\", which js really disslikes!",
