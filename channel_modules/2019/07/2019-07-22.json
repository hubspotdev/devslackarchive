    "text": "Hi Guys\n\nI am using a CTA field on a custom module, the CTA I am using is set as a no style design, I basically want to just output it as a text link, then use CSS to style it up myself to look like a button so that my marketers don’t have to worry about styling up a CTA properly. I have done this multiple times before and it has worked well but this time, my no style CTA is being output as an image instead of plain text and I can’t figure out why. Has HubSpot changed something? Does anyone have any idea?\n\nMany thanks!!",

What I need is to disable the size controls without enabling the prevent edit option because I still need to let people change the image. I know you can do so with a regular image field but I can't seem to find a way for this type of field ( it's a requirement that I use the logo field ). I did check the hubl supported tags section from the docs but there isn't anything I could find to be of help.",
