    "text": "Jeff &amp; Josh are spot on - those are far and away the most popular. I personally _love_ 1Password and you’d want to use their 1Password for Teams account type. Definitely more pricey than LastPass, but it’s a difference of a couple bucks a month, so it’s essentially negligible.\n\nI’d figure out if folks on your internal team are already using one or the other and go from there…both will do the job very nicely.\n\nThis is actually lined up for an Agency Toolbox video podcast episode coming out soon…basically walking through what we chose, why, and how we use/segment it (<https://www.doinbound.com/agency-toolbox>) :thumbsup:"
