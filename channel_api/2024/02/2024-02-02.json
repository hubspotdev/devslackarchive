I have already scoured the internet but i'm hoping it's simple as it is key for some specific reports based on *who* updated a *specific contact field*.",

If you need more details, you'll have to use the record ID that you get to then perform a GET call back to HubSpot (Read Contact endpoint, see API documentation) so you can retrieve more data for your application.\n\nAlternatively, Ops Hub Pro provides webhooks in workflows, where you *can* set what other properties to include in the payload. But since we're having this conversation, I take it you don't have access to Ops Hub Pro."
