At the moment the A/B variations don't work. That is exactly why we chose to use landing page to create the banner.\n\nThe purpose of the banner an A/B tests is to push free software users into a paid subscription. The iframes is placed on login, homepage and sidebar menu.\n\n*Update*: What i mean by banner is the iframe content on the right side of this login page: <https://login.onixwork.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fconnect%2Fauthorize%2Fcallback%3Fclient_id%3DN48b600jQ8TbskNwlyxP1xMOzfQ7fRRH%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fonixwork.com%252Fprod%252FHome%252FCallback%26response_type%3Dcode%2520id_token%26scope%3Dopenid%2520profile%2520onixwork%26state%3DOpenIdConnect.AuthenticationProperties%253D4qUmjJ1E0CAXaLU7LGiu9Srsa45XCZFz3BhHsFJ3Suh_mrnsd6wGWyXClhpvR_bETFAnyYnkijlfn9Wghejek4OAp_ghS5FKit7whKpJn52Dx46fH-eGEOkT7x3lFnjLZMiN8XhiaEOZan20gcID5F5HFhp3bRSfIFtD7BlVaq9IcTIq-TTGY9pl52Su_ebWmfzZPdjoflrXPbX2tRY3HTDUhFgyTY7kDIx0aUe9b_VBxOdH8KbZvduzZjq5Bg72%26response_mode%3Dform_post%26nonce%3D638349857612829866.NTgxMDMzOTktYTZjOC00YTZmLThjZGItZTQyNmNkYmVjMDJjY2QzZDlmYjUtMjE4ZS00NDNjLTkzZDUtNmQwYmJjODBmZmZi%26x-client-SKU%3DID_NET461%26x-client-ver%3D5.3.0.0|View page> Now it’s a blog post and we’re testing using landing page instead since that has A/B testing features."

    "text": "Sure, there could be several reasons why your navbar is displaying as an unordered list instead of dropdowns. Here are some common issues you might want to check:\n1. *CSS Framework*: Are you using a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so, ensure that the framework's CSS is properly linked in your HTML.\n2. *CSS Styles*: If you're using custom CSS, make sure that your styles are correctly applied to the navbar elements and that the dropdown-related styles are not being overridden by other styles.\n3. *JavaScript*: Many dropdown menus require JavaScript or jQuery to work properly. Check if you have included the necessary scripts and if they are initialized correctly.\n4. *HTML Structure*: Confirm that your HTML structure matches the expected pattern for dropdowns. There might be specific classes or data attributes needed for dropdown functionality.\n5. *Browser Cache*: Sometimes, browsers cache files and do not reflect changes. Try clearing your cache or using incognito mode to see if that's causing the issue.\n6. *CSS Visibility*: The dropdown items might be set to `display: none;` by default and are not being toggled visible by your JavaScript or CSS.\nWithout seeing your code, it's tough to pinpoint the exact issue. If you can upload the relevant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, I can look into it and help you figure out what's missing or incorrect."

Add Your Domain to HubSpot:\n    ◦ Go to your HubSpot account and navigate to `Settings &gt; Website &gt; Domains &amp; URLs`.\n    ◦ Click `Connect a domain`.\n    ◦ Choose the type of domain you want to connect (e.g., website).\n    ◦ Enter your domain and follow the instructions to point your DNS records to HubSpot.\n2. Update DNS Records:\n    ◦ Log in to your AWS Management Console and go to the Route 53 or the relevant area where your domain's DNS settings are managed.\n    ◦ Update the DNS records to point to HubSpot. You'll need to update your CNAME record for `www` and any other subdomains you're transferring, as well as the A record for the apex domain if applicable. HubSpot will provide the values for these records.\n3. Wait for Propagation:\n    ◦ Once you update the DNS settings, it may take some time (typically up to 48 hours) for the changes to propagate across the internet. During this time, your website may be temporarily inaccessible.\n4. Verify Connection:\n    ◦ After DNS propagation, verify the connection in your HubSpot settings to ensure everything is working correctly.\n"
