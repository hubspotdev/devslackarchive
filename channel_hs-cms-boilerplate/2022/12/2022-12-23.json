I’d question if it were new, but Occam’s Razor points towards me just not paying enough attention. Interested to see if anyone has more info on this!\n\nRegarding the `no_wrapper` property: to my understanding, this is only applicable for modules included in a template via the `{% module %}` tag. The wrapper in question is the one that allows for selecting modules by directly clicking them in the page builder. It’s occasionally handy for solving selector/structure issues brought about by generated markup, but mostly useful for things like preventing fixed or overlapping elements from z-fighting while working in the page builder."
