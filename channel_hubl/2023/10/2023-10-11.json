It has similar issues of being abandoned and needing to be updated to new versions of Tailwind and PostCSS, but it *does* come pre-configured with HubL-CSS/Tailwind compatibility.\n\nIf you’d rather not use a new starter, you can manually incorporate the <https://github.com/spingroup/postcss-hubl|postcss-hubl plugin> into your build process."
