I've seen, that by using the HubSpot UI there is a system internal automation that deletes in a GDPR compliant way - i was wondering if we can trigger this automation also by using the API? Thanks for feedback! :thumbsup:",

At this time, there is no way to _permanently_ delete a contact via the Contacts API in the same way as is available in-app.\n\nI definitely see the need for such a feature, though. Could you upvote and comment on this feature request (<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/GDPR-deletion-via-API-call/idi-p/201590>)? I’ve just upvoted it myself."
