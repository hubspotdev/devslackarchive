    "text": "Hello everyone,\nI'm experiencing an issue with displaying certain native properties of products in HubSpot. Specifically, while attempting to render the `hs_product_type` and `hs_object_id` properties, only the product name appears correctly; the other fields remain empty or show default values.\nHere's the code snippet I'm using:\n```{% set products = crm_objects(\n    \"product\", \n    \"limit=16&amp;properties=hs_product_type\")\n%}\n\n&lt;h3&gt;{{ products.total }} Products found:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n{% for product in products.results %}\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    Name: {{ product.name }}&lt;br&gt;\n    Product Type: {{ product.hs_product_type|default(\"Not specified\") }}&lt;br&gt;\n    Record ID: {{ product.hs_object_id|default(\"N/A\") }}\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;```\nI've confirmed that:\n• The `hs_product_type` and `hs_object_id` properties are populated for each product.\n• There are no conditional logics or permissions restricting the visibility of these properties.\n• The internal names of the properties are correctly referenced.\nDespite these checks, the issue persists. Has anyone encountered a similar problem or have suggestions on how to resolve this?\nThank you in advance for your assistance!"
