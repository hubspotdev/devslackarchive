    "text": "&gt; Any particular benefits or just modernizing?\nMainly just modernizing and cutting down on the amount of code being used + making it easier to follow what is going on there.\n\n&gt; Can I swap existing pages that used the previous default layout without consequences?\nThere may be some very slight changes in terms of widths at different breakpoints. The old layout changed the widths very slightly at some different breakpoints but it didn't feel necessary to carry that over. So basically at those breakpoints there will be some very minor differences but other than that it should be basically the same."
