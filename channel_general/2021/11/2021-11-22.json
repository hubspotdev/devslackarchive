    "text": "Thanks for the reply Mitja. That's actually what I ended up using. But it ended up meaning way more code e.g. in the instance the editor doesn't set a category, we need to use `blog_recent_posts` and if we want to force one specific post to show that a whole lot more code needed. It just seems crazy to me that all those features are built into the `related_blog_posts` tag but not a sort function"
