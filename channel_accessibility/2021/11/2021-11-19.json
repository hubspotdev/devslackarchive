    "text": "Hey Matt, just giving an update. We’re still working out how to roll this kind of change out while minimizing disruption. We’ve identified that analytics tracking set up via the Analytics chrome extension may be affected by this change so we’re still figuring some things out.\n\nThis is not an official time estimate, more a heads up. The U.S. Thanksgiving holiday is next week. During the holiday season we try to minimize disruptive changes to avoid causing developers pain. Since this change is likely to break some styling and JavaScript on sites, I think we’re looking at after the Holiday season for the change to go into effect, and we’ll make sure to announce ahead of time so developers can make any tweaks to older sites if they relied on those ids."
