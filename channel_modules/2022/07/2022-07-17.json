    "text": "Hi. I’m confused…\nIt’s impossible to add any new module. Something is broken and the new modules are not displayed in the list. At first, I made them through CLI and everything was fine. When I started working through the Design Tools, I only experience difficulties. And now, no matter how I create modules, the system doesn’t see them.\nAlso, I could not delete the existing module in Design Tools. I did it in CLI, but I got weird errors.\nIt stopped my work :disappointed: Can anyone help me?",
