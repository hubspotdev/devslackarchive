I have a new account and began the beginner guide on the HubSpot website but got stuck on step 2.1, when I enter `hs init` in the cli and proceed to the website and login it continuously loops me back to the login. I did a bit of digging on the web and found <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Unable-to-Get-Personal-CMS-Access-Key/td-p/462455|this 2 day old post> from a user experiencing the same issue but none of the suggested fixes have worked for me"

I know you can create a module and use a text field for the caption, but we want to be able to use this within the rich text editor."
