    "text": "Hello everyone, i have created a private knowledge base on HubSpot that require users to register with email &amp; password. All works good except that when the user has finished entering his infos ( email &amp; password ) on the registration page, then clicks on the \"Save my password\" button, he is redirected to a \"404 error\" page. Actually, the account gets created, and he receives the confirmation email afterwards so he can login to the private knowledge base ! My question is : How can I change the redirection link after pressing on \"Save my password\" on the registeration page to the home page or a new page thats says \"Thanks for creating your account\" with a button that redirects to the login page. PS : The form and the button are autogenerated by HubSpot so i dont have the hands on the code in the HubSpot design tools."
