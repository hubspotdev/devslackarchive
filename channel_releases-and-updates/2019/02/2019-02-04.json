    "text": "Howdy dev community!\n\nYou may have already noticed :sleuth_or_spy:, but we introduced some awesome SEO improvements to HubDB Dynamic Pages! In a table's settings, you can now choose columns to specify the values for the featured image, meta description and canonical URL of the individual dynamic pages. This makes for much more SEO friendly, and unique dynamic pages, without any hacky HubL to make it work!\n\nIf you do not choose these columns, or leave blank cells for these columns, dynamic pages will continue to inherit these values from the parent page.\n\nSee updated Step 1 for instructions: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tutorials/how-to-build-dynamic-pages-with-hubdb>\n\nEnjoy!",
