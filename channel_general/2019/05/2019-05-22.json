The host is very unique, meaning it wouldn’t interfere with any current DNS records you have, and proves domain ownership allowing us to issue an SSL certificate for the ‘www’ subdomain you are looking to connect.\n\nWhile I can definitely provide you with such a record for this alternate method, I would want to point out that this process shouldn’t be necessary in your case.\n\nThese methods of domain validation, prior to connection of the subdomain, are done so that an SSL certificate can be generated before a connection is made, so that if visitors are currently accessing your site over ‘https’ and you switch web hosts, that they continue to access the site over ‘https’ without issue.\n\nI can see that there is no certificate covering the subdomain on your external web host, meaning that ‘SSL downtime’ would not be a concern, and that you could move forward with the connection process (creating the appropriate CNAME records) without issue.\n\nShortly after connection, an SSL certificate will be auto generated for the subdomain."
