What I want to achieve is to pull all tickets created or updated today and sync them to my local DB every day.\n\nThe number of tickets we have on HubSpot is large, and trying to pull all tickets daily is not sustainable. I prefer a situation whereby I can pull all and sync the tickets created or updated per day at the end of that day to my local DB. How can I limit the returned data by the date created or the date updated?\n\nThe referenced API is GET /crm-objects/v1/objects/tickets/paged",

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.
