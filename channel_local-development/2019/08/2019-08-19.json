    "text": ":wave: Happy Monday! I am happy to share that we released a new version of `@HubSpot/cms-cli` today.\n\n*Version Update | v0.0.22*\nWhatâ€™s changed?\n- Consolidated uploading of files and folders into the `upload`command. The sync command is *no longer supported, use `upload` instead*.\n- Added modes to support fetching and uploading drafted changes to assets (e.g. `hscms upload --portal=PROD --mode=draft project-folder project-folder`). We also added support for a `defaultMode` that can be set at the top-level of the config or for specific portals.\n- Removed the `--portalId` option. The `--portal` option accepts both portal ids and config names.\n\nRun `npm install -g @HubSpot/cms-cli@latest` to update your version and get access to these new features. Be sure to let us know if you have any questions or have feedback."

The name is used as a key  when storing data for content created from the template so you also need to be careful when making changes to the name if the template is used for published content."
