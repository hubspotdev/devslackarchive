If I create a HubDB that has a URL type field for linking up to existing pages and my markup just pulls in that field as the href, what structure is that field expecting? Is it expecting the entire URL, anything after the root domain, or will it take any of the URL parts depending on what page that item is viewed on? Does anyone know?"
