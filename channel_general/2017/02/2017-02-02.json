Ideally we want to line it up when is most helpful for everyone here, and we also have some exciting announcements to share. \n\nThat said, here are a few options:\n1. Early October (right after INBOUND ’17)\n2. Mid-to-late October\n3. November\n4. December\n\nLet us know if you have any preference and if you have any questions, let <@U22PQ1GUE> or myself know."
