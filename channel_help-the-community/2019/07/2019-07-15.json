We opened a ticket about it around 12 days ago with HS support and it still opened meanwhile we think it is quite an important topic.

Essentially, after hitting submit I need to access a custom URL. For example if someone enters the email address <mailto:xyz@abc.com|xyz@abc.com>, I need to access \"<https://slack.com/api/users.admin.invite?token=dsfhjkdsfah123456&amp;email=xyz@abc.com>\". Is there a simple way to do this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

User uses search bar on HubSpot landing page\n2. You want the user should see WordPress pages in that search\n3. (this is when I get confused) When the user clicks on a WordPress page, it takes them to the WordPress page? Or the HubSpot-hosted landing page?\n\nNot sure if I understand correctly, but maybe this answer will provide a conclusion: the default search functionality wonâ€™t show content you host outside of HubSpot."
