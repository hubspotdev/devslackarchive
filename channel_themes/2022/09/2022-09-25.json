For example an Image and Text module, has the option to choose which side what shows, 'Image - Text' or 'Text - Image'.\n\nIn the theme requirements page, there is a part where it is mentioned that the theme must have `dnd_area` modules.\n\n1. Should I now go through all 50 modules and make them dnd-abble (which will take me a month or so)\n2. Can I add a 'flexible' module which supports dnd area and submit it like that\n3. Or can I submit my theme as is?",
