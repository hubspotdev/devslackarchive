Hopefully over time I'll be able to answer more and more commonly asked questions on this slack. I'll never be able to analyze code like you do but hopefully I can answer common questions and also make it easier for newer developers to get started on HubSpot.\n\nMessage me directly or `@` me in a channel and I'll do my best to answer the question. I'll try to save the trouble of looking up a relevant doc or explaining common things."
