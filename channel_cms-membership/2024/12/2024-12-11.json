We're trying to do something similar here and I stumbled on this thread.\nWe created a custom module that is hosted behind: Audience access &gt; Access Control &gt; Single Sign-On Required.\n\nWe setup an Okta application and users attributes statements.\nNow, I'm wondering how can I read the user attributes from within the CMS page custom module?\nI would like to access user first name, last name, email, for example."
