    "text": "Hey all, I have a question regarding how HubSpot and HUBL (require_js) is loading and inserting javascript files into our website twice. i.e. Inserting our google maps scripts twice on the page.  Since the issue relates to JS, i figure this is a good place?\n\nEssentially, I'm adding a require_js('url') in my module, but the end result in the page source, it's added twice causing google maps errors... Has anyone come across this?",
