Does anyone know the best way to pull the recent posts through to WordPress, please?\n\nI have downloaded and set up the HubSpot connector plugin but it doesn't seem to give the option for a featured image which we need to be included.\nI appreciate this is more WP orientated than HS, but any advice greatly appreciated.

Now - I'm mostly front end and don't typically handle things of this scope...but here I am...having to handle.\n\nWhen ya'll have previously done a complete redesign for an existing large website (50-100+ pages) -- what is the typical process you have gone through? I haven't seen a great way of handling a mass migration from a separate staging environment to the live for a quick replacement and simple handling of redirects. Anybody have any recommendations for handling this process?\n\nCurrently we are building on one of the secondary HS domains as to prevent cross-contamination/accidentally replacing existing pages. Right now it looks like we are looking at a page-by-page take down/archive of the live site and migration from the secondary to the primary domain of the staged content, publishing, and then manually checking redirects for all replaced pages. That and having a construction page covering the transition with a site-wide redirect until all pages except the home page are published.\n\nDoes this even seem logical??"

For those agencies that use Accello, what did your onboarding process look like and do you have any advice for a smooth transition? We will be moving from DoInbound, for reference.",
