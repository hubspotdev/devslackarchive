    "text": "Hi Guys\n\nI am working with the new API for the first time and I need to do the equivalent of the old 'Get a contact by its user token' endpoint (<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/get_contact_by_utk>) but I can't find an equivalent in the new API. My first guess was to just use the Read endpoint in the CRM Contacts API and change the idProperty parameter to be the token but I am not sure what the correct property would be to use? I have tried a few guesses but can't get it to work.\n\nWhat is the best way to do this with the new API? Thanks!!",
