    "text": "Hi all! Got a question I haven’t been able to find a straight answer for -\n\nI’m moving a WP site over to HS. The WP site is using the root domain to host their content. I can see Google has indexed these pages, as the root URL is what shows in search results. Should I launch this new HS site also on the root domain to avoid an SEO hit, and set the www as my redirect domain? Or can I launch on the www and set up proper 301s to avoid a huge SEO hit?\n\nThanks!",
