    "text": "<@UDHT6N5SM> if you are newer to the HubSpot Ecosystem I def recommend developing with modules being used as a primary asset. I think any time youre building something “modular” where you dont necessarily know the use-case/ larger context of the picture it is difficult to create “correct” semantic markup.\n\nI do think that with the recent theme rollout it is a bit easier to structure some of that. and with the previous “Legacy DND template builder” you can always add wrapping divs to markup but that just furthers “Div Purgatory”  haha\n\nYou should be able to add &lt;sections&gt; or &lt;asides&gt; to your own modules though. And if you want to give content editors the flexibility to choose you could alwas set a boolean or a choice field to toggle them conditionally in the markup of the module."
