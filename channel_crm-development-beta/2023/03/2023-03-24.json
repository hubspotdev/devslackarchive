These updates shouldn’t have any impact on your work, but they can’t be completed in our system until all participants in the beta have redeployed their projects.\n\n*Any projects that haven’t been deployed since January 26 will be automatically undeployed on May 19, and any apps in those projects will be uninstalled.* More details in the thread: :thread:",
