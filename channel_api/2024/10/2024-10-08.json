    "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe are building a Workflow using a Google Apps Script which the idea is to connect to HubSpot (either HS Workflow or API). The flow is like this:\n\n1. We download the monthly renewals from HubSpot and import them into Google Sheets\n2. In Google Sheets we run some operations for our customers using the Apps Script.\n3. Later in the workflow, we want to trigger the import of Deal Creation information from Google Sheets into HubSpot and retrieve the Record ID back into Sheets.\n4. This will allow us to create the line items with their respective Record IDs and\n5. Finally send those line items into HubSpot to store and update the information for each customer.\n\n• I'm pretty confident this is achievable, but I want to speak with some experts to understand whether it's doable within HubSpot Workflows or if it's better to build a private app using the API. \n• Which option is more reliable, easier to build, maintenance, etc?\nThanks in advance!! :handshake:",
