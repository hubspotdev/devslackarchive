    "text": "Hello! I have a couple of questions:\n1. Does any one here use MJML to generate the html output for custom html templates, and if so, has anyone had issues with columns stacking on mobile, even if they are within a mj-group element? Can’t figure this one out. It seems like HS emails doesn’t really get along well with the mjml column system. \n2. I was told when my client went to marketing pro that it is possible to set up within a template a custom endpoint url that would hit our main application, which would return email-ready HTML to inject in the email. Does anyone know where the documentation on this is? \n",

    "text": "Hey Paul,\n#1 I recommend checking this tool <@UEC65BQV8> made out.  <https://github.com/douglaswelcome/hs-mjml-email-engine>\n\n#2 - with CMS Hub pro you can set up say a trigger on a website that hits a serverless function which could hit your endpoint and get the html and then use the <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/email/transactional_email/single-send-overview|HubSpot email APIs to send an email>.\n\nAlternatively you could create a workflow that triggers a webhook.\n\nOtherwise if it’s something you can simply have a template for and use personalization tokens for then all you really need is to create a template designated for automation. Then you can send the template in a workflow"
