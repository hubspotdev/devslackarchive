I have already done something similar to what you have asked but with an ecommerce platform - WooCommerce. That was a 1 way sync though. The extension is used to pull new orders created at Amazon at regular interval of times and then accordingly creating deals ( for amz orders ) and contacts records on HubSpot.\n\nTo know more about the same, please refer here:\n<https://makewebbetter.com/services/HubSpot-amazon-ebay-integration/>"
