Now you're reading in español. Always a good one to check if nothing else works. :wink:"

That specific variable is used on web pages using Memberships and is populated after a contact logs in (i.e. it's not right for this circumstance)\n\n1. Check these docs <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/cms/hubl/functions#crm_associations>\n2. Instead, you can just use `contact.hs_object_id`\n3. Also, sounds like you want to only return deals in a certain stage. You can do this by adding a filter statement as the 4th argument in the function call. Since you're using a deal stage, you will likely need the internal stage ID in the filter\n\nsomething like this:\n```{% set associated_deals = crm_associations(contact.hs_object_id, 'HubSpot_DEFINED',4,'dealstage=12345', 'dealname,cnumber,packagepurchasedate') %}```"
