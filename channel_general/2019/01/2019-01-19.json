    "text": "Dunno if this is the right channel, but dare to ask :muscle:\nGot a question about licenses; when I'm looking at the various checks on the pricing pages, is it correct to state that;\n- With marketing hub pro you are able to build landing pages (and make full use of the design manager with all it's features), but _no_ blog and website pages?\n- Features like multi-language _are_ available with marketing hub pro, but site menu's etc are only available with the cms add-on?\n- HubDB is also only available with the CMS add-on?\n\nBasically I'm a bit confused what exactly is included in marketing hub and what's a specific cms feature.. Is there a resource to be found somewhere where this is explained clearly? Found this (<https://legal.HubSpot.com/HubSpot-product-and-services-catalog>) but to be honest it doesn't help me a lot as it's refering to HubSpot CRM mostly..",

    "text": "Hi Jurjen while I am not the best person to answer about what pricing packages have what. I do know there is overlap between a lot of them and The CMS addon has many of the features the higher plans have, but that’s because those are specific to HubSpot’s CMS platform.\n\nif you use the chat bubble that comes up when visiting the HubSpot site you could ask them for clarification.(That goes to sales reps, and they would be able to answer better than most)"
