If module field values could affect the module.css file, every instance of a module’s CSS would need to be loaded separately, because every instance could be different. The result would likely be duplicate CSS and potentially conflicting styles when multiple instances of a module occur on a page.\n\nSimilar for module.js - as the solution is explained with CSS, we have an explanation for module.js as well\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/files#scripting-based-on-field-values>"
