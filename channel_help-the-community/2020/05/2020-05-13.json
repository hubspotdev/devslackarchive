    "text": "Hello :slightly_smiling_face:  When we're creating pop up forms the image on the left is really too small and there's also no way of positioning it. Is there any way some customisation could be achieved? We tried 3rd party software but it seems to be a bit of a problem performance wise. Is it something that could eventually end up in <#C26E7JT8V|ideas> or is it just not possible for some reason? Thank you!",

I'm working on localhost to integrate <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/create_contact> to my companys website... basically im making a post request onSubmit (this is a Gatsby app - similar to React). I made an API key, and added it to the end of the url using environment variables but im getting a CORS error... is there a way I can test this out locally since I cant test this on our production website? thanks in advance!!",

    "text": "Hey <@U013L6H9QQJ> That API doesn’t accept requests made from the client side, that’s why you are seeing the CORS errors. You should use the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form|Form Submission API> instead. That will allow you to call it from the front-end. The contacts API requires your API keys (as you saw) and calling it from your static app would expose the key to any visitor of your site."
