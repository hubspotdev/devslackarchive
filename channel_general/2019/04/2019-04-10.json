I have reported this bug probably 15 times.\n\nThe cause of the problem is how HubSpot stores that a folder was deleted, instead of it actually being deleted it is flagged as deleted, and simply not shown. The copy to portal process does not reflag the folder as not deleted, so it is hidden in the design manager."
