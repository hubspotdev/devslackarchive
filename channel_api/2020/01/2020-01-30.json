    "text": "Hey <@USXDJP5AN> Appreciate the feedback.  The Search endpoints don’t return associations, though you can use some associations in the filter for the search. The easiest way to accomplish your goal will be ot get the associations for each returned onbect from the search API. We’ll be releasing a batch associations API soon though so you can get everything you need in 2 calls.\n\nWe made the decision to not return assocaitions in the search endpoints since searching is fundamentally different than returning by ID so we powered it with different systems behind the hood. This decision meant that looking up associations would be a bit more expensive.  So it was about the trade offs.  We chose a more flexible seach function vs returning more details (namely the associated objects).  It could be that this was the wrong decision, but that’s why we have betas!"
