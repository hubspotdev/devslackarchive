    "text": "Hello! Iâ€™m trying to map the backend properties for a non-HubSpot multiple choice questionnaire. However, the options in HubSpot Contact Properties are limited to Multiple Checkboxes or Radio single select, which yield a very messy output or limit selection for the user to one option, respectively. Has anyone been able to find a way around this? Perhaps so that only the selected options in the questionnaire are visible in the form submission? Thank you :pray:",
