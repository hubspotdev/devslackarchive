For example, when doing custom coded templates, we dont need the `&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/hs/hsstatic/AsyncSupport/static-1.43/sass/comments_listing_asset.css\"&gt;` as it makes it harder to overwrite those existing styles. If we had an option in settings to remove those files that would be nice too"
