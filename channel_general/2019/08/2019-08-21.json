We're not migrating from wordpress, have everything as a CSV, and backing into valid XML for the import parser is proving to be a hassle. I know <@U6W3H6YN8> has a repo to do this, but I was hoping a more straight forward solution might be out there. Thanks!"

The hubDB pages now live at what was the original blog versions URL and the blog version now lives at a different URL. The following redirect was dynamically generated when we changed the url within the blog settings. After that got all set up correctly we successfully published the DB version with original url and it happily points to the listings page that is generated dynamically using DB. yay!\n\n```https?://www.domain.com/slug(?P&lt;page_slug&gt;/.*)?$\n<http://www.domain.com/slug-archive{page_slug}>```\n\nHowever, we are needing to make sure that anybody that goes to `<http://www.domain.com/slug-archive{page-slug}>` get's redirected to the new happy version that lives at `<https://www.domain.com/slug{page-slug}>` .... which was the original URL of all the pages to begin with.\n\nWe are concerned about creating a redirect loop with setting up a new redirect pointing from `/slug-archive{page-slug}` to `/slug{page-slug}` and I'm wanting to know if that concern is legit, and if so, could I get some advice on how to handle?"
