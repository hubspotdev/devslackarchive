    "text": "Hi, I have a 404 / system page which looks like this; <https://www.resourcify.com/de/404>\n\nThe header, as you may have seen, is in English. The header is a global module and a DE (German) variation of it exists (can be seen working here: <https://www.resourcify.com/de/>)\n\nFor system pages, you cannot create multi-lang pages, so global modules (as far as I know), do not work on system pages?\n\nI have implemented a workaround for the footer (which I’ve had to convert into a local module in order to get it to work). That workaround being getting the region slug from the URL\n\n{% set path = request.path|split(‘/’) %}\n{% set path = path[3] %}\n\n{% if content.language == “de” || query_lang == “de” || path == “de”  %}\n    // show German footer menu\n{% else %}\n     // show English menu\n{% endif %}\n\nWhat I’m looking for confirmation on is, is there really no way to get lang variations of global modules to work for system pages?\n\nIs there someway in Hubl where I can get a language variant of that global module?\n\ni.e. something like:\n\n{% if content.language == “de” || query_lang == “de” || path == “de”  %}\n   // get DE variant info of global module\n{% endif %}"
