    "text": "Hello, everyone!\n\nWe wanted to write a note to the entire HubSpot Developer Slack and share some exciting news!\n\nOver the past year, we’ve been hard at work on new projects and efforts to improve your overall developer experience here at HubSpot. We care about building a world-class platform and believe the best way to do that is to partner with those who have been building with our tools for years; sharing your ideas, concerns, and desire to help people learn how to build with HubSpot.\n\nOn that note, we’re excited to announce that <@U2H3TT8F2> and <@U7SL518D6> have joined the HubSpot Developer Relations team. A few months ago, they both saw HubSpot had job openings on Dev Rel and approached our team to see if they could continue to help grow the community as full-time advocates.\n\n*What does this mean?*\n\nAs our Senior CMS Developer Advocates, they will help us amplify your voices, feedback, share project updates, and requests throughout the HubSpot organization.\n\nJon’s CrankShaft and browser extension projects will remain his, as open-source projects. Both AJ and Jon will continue to be available in this group, along with our other HubSpot folks <@UFBNA9K9A>, <@UMA6E2NDU>, <@UME946VPW> <@U22PKFRU5> <@U6W3H6YN8> (and others) as resources. They will stay the same leaders they are today.\nWe hope you’ll join us in welcoming our newest developer advocates!\n\nIf you, your team, or agency has any questions, please feel free to reach out to any of us or DM me directly. Thank you :sprocket-dance: and say hi to anyone on the team if you are at INBOUND this week!",
