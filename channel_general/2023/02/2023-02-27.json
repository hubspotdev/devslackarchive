However I want to be able to associate that object with an organisation. From what I've seen, I can do that as a second call but I need to know the HubSpot ID of the organisation.\n\nWhat I really want, is to be able to associate the custom object with an organisation automatically, or at a second choice, be able to create the association using a defined field (internal org ID) rather than the HubSpot ID. I guess I can fetch and then push based off the HubSpot ID, but that makes this a much larger piece of work.\n\nAm I missing something obvious here?",
