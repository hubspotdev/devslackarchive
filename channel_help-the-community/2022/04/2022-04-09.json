Hello!\n\nI recently implemented the embedded meetings calendar on our website (<http://lexion.ai/thank-you|lexion.ai/thank-you>), and I was wondering if there is a way for there to be any parameters or a cookie of somesort to be added, to auto-populate their email into the meetings calendar (see screenshots below).\n\nFor example, I would love to see \"<mailto:taylor@lexion.ai|taylor@lexion.ai>\" carried over to the next screen automatically, so I don't have to fill it in again. Is this possible?",
