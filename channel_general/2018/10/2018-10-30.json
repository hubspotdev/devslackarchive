The reason cdn2 links work is because on cdn2 we respond to these requests with a `206` (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/206>), and specify a `Content-Range` http header to allow Safari to only download partial content. We are investigating being able to do the same on connected domain requests actively.
