    "text": "Hi All - I am looking to add simple lines of text beneath my dropdown menu links. Here's a sample shot of the menu structure. I would like to add a line of text (preferably in a &lt;p&gt; tag)  beneath each link. Looking in the 'Advanced Menu' settings screen there doesn't seem to be much to help me. When I try adding an 'Item', it still defaults to rendering as an anchor tag.\n\nWondering if I need to create a custom HTML menu in order to have this flexibility, but wanted to ask you fine folks first. Thank you!",
