    "text": "Hi! I hope this is the correct channel to ask for some opinions on an issue with a custom theme that's making me crazy.\n\nIt goes like this. We've developed a new theme based on the CMS Boilerplate, over a certain account.\n\nYou can see a test page working correctly here: <http://HubSpot-developers-y36h1z-8989991.hs-sites.com/en/home>\n\nNow that the basic module structure of the theme is done, we've deployed this new theme over another account. The problem is that we are having several issues with the CSS. For example, if you check here, you'll see that there are several alignment issues: <https://www.jenji.io/-temporary-slug-7aa223ce-00d2-4853-80ee-78de2d16db8a?hs_preview=STFtZwcF-41706155230>\n\nWe've tried everything but at this point we are lost. If you do a diff of both pages you'll see that there are some CSS differences. We believe the culprit is how HubSpot handles CSS minification, some things are getting lost in the way.\n\nJust to discard problems on our end, we created a second new development environment over the original account, deployed the theme, and all is working fine: <http://HubSpot-developers-y36h1z-9011097.hs-sites.com/home>\n\nSo the problem comes when we deploy the theme on the other DIFFERENT account. So, to make it clear, 9011097 and 8989991 are hosted in one account, and the <http://jenji.io|jenji.io> domain is on another account.\n\nMaybe we are doing something wrong? We are new to HubSpot CMS development but so far we had no issues up until deploying the theme on our other official account.\n\nI'd be very thankful for any pointers on this, it's stressing us way too much :disappointed:."
