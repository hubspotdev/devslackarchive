But if I add language version for footer or header, then style not loading in global content editor. Apparently this problem appeared recently. Just a month ago it definitely wasnâ€™t there. No changes have been made with the theme. How to fix this?\n\nUPDATE: Same problem with any theme.",

If you create a child theme and create the module there, it wouldn't be available on your current pages without changing the theme for each page, but since all modules are now accessible from other themes, it should work if the folder is outside of a child in the main design tools directory"
