    "text": "When building a new theme for the marketplace, how much do you consider future developer experience? Generally, I'd like to include a build process with webpack, tailwind, etc. but I can imagine that someone purchasing a theme would at least initially prefer to work out of the design manager. Any thoughts on striking that balance? Is it a requirement that everything is directly editable through the design manager only?",

    "text": "I'd say it like this:\nYou can build and use almost everything you like, but Keep it as simple as possible. \nUtilizing webpack can be great, but you have to think about the fact that many HubSpot user who might have access to the design manager have only \"basic html/css knowledge\" since HubSpot is a marketing/sales/service software. Therefore confronting them with advanced techniques like webpack/tailwind... Might cause dissatisfaction.\n\nSomething you can think about is putting up a \"regular\" version onto the marketplace and offering a \"free\" optional webpack/tailwind upgrade to buyers if they request it. \nThis is, because you will - most likely - violate against the theme marketplace guidelines since can't have the same theme uploaded twice into the marketplace"
