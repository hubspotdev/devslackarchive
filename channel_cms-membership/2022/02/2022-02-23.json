But really disappointed that it is not possible.\n\nHowever, I am working on the workaround. i.e create a new contact with the same email (temporarily update existing contact email to some random) enroll it in existing list via some additional condition (so the registration email is sent to this new contact).\nMerge existing old contact with new contact.\n\nI am not done with it yet, but I have tried it i.e creation and merging of contacts manually and it works.\nCreation of automation/workflows to do all this automatically is in my queue.\nOnce done, I will update this thread"
