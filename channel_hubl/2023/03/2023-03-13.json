Or event create another module that would bring those posts, but then skip them from the contents loop. Does anyone knows if this is possible? or how could I make this happen?"

    "text": "Hey guys I have module here that is designed to display a button that when clicked displays a pop up card with some content in it. The problem I'm having here is that the when the other buttons are clicked, they display the 1st content card message rather than the content that is filled out for itself. For example, button#2 and button#3 displays content 1 rather than content 2 and 3. I must be doing something fundamentally incorrect. Maybe the way the module is designed makes it impossible idk. I would like some help or advice on how I should approach this issue. Thanks :))",
