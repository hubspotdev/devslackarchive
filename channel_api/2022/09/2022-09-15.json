    "text": "Hello, I have a question regarding the HubSpot connector in airbyte. I connected HubSpot to our data warehouse a few days ago and everything seems to work fine. The only problem is that I don’t get the data from custom made ticket properties in our data warehouse (using Postgres). The custom made ticket properties appear as columns in the ticket table in our data warehouse, but they don’t have any values inside. I already tried different sync modes in airbyte, as well as syncing the data raw and normalized. Does anybody have experience with the airbyte HubSpot connector and could give me some advice on that specific problem? Thanks in advance! :slightly_smiling_face:",
