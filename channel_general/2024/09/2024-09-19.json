We feed all sales-related content into HubSpot, but the customer wants to view content information now, too, such as posted listings.\n\nI suggest we create a sales pipeline with each type of posting as its own stage.\n\nAs listings become expired or are marked as sold, they change stages.\n\nIs this the best way to feed the info from our CMS to Customer CRM? The goal is for them to have the best reporting opportunity.",
