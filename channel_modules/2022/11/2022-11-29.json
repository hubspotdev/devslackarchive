I guess it's still ugly because you still see those default image controls in the image dropdown, and it can be misleading for the user."

This is what I’ve done for individual instances of modules, but I didn’t realize that it was valid to call HubL filters in your fields.json! It makes sense now that I think about it, but for some reason, I had just assumed that HubL in json files wouldn’t be processed."
