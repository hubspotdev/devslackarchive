    "text": "I had this exact same problem a few weeks ago and posted on this channel and didn't find any good solutions. Apparently the HS team is considering making the HubDB RTF the same as the RTF throughout the rest of the software that can support HTML, but no timeline was given. It is kind of hacky, but I found a workaround to put in HTML tables into HubDB fields, but your average user won't be able to do it. Basically if you export your HubDB table to CSV, then you can put HTML into specific cells, then reimport the CSV back in, it will work and show your HTML. But again, the average non-technical user isn't going to be able to or want to do this."
