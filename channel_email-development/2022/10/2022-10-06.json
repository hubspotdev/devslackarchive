I've got to grips with Hubl and its functionality but I'd like to return a phone number of a deal owner within a custom built email in Design Manager. Does anybody know if this is possible? So far I can only reach the Owner name following deal.HubSpot_owner_id. Any insight is much appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:",
