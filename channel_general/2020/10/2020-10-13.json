If you are ever unsure, you can always post them here in <#C22PU4LV8|general> or <#CD432DF3K|new-to-HubSpot-cms> and we can point you to the right channels if needed.\n\nFor starting building on HS, I would suggest reviewing our developer docs here <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms> if you have questions after reviewing those, feel free to ask away :slightly_smiling_face:"

My functional goal is that if I have 5000 contacts who qualify to enter the workflow, I can only enter the first 500, while the remaining 4500 are somehow put on \"hold\". Any ideas?"
