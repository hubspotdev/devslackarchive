HubDB for each pipe instance, and relate it back? Second custom object? Save the pipe object as a text JSON field? (is there any way for a sales rep to make sense of that if they need to?)\n\nhappy to share my demo page privately with anyone who has thoughts on this.",

My firm is evaluating HubSpot as a potential marketing automation tool and I was hoping someone on this slack channel might have experience doing this.\n\nFeel free to DM me directly. Thank you in advance!"
