If not, I’d recommend using the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/ui-components/crm-action-components/crm-action-button|CRM action button> and the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/ui-components/crm-action-components/overview#send-a-one-to-one-email|Send a one-to-one email> action rather than customizing a button and using a serverless function. Hope that helps!"
