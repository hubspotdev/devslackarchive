    "text": "Hey folks, I hope you are doing well,\nWe're aiming to enable HubSpot users to upload files directly to our Api via a an UI Extension card. However, we've encountered a limitation within the UI Extensions frameworkâ€”the component library doesn't currently include a file input component. Additionally, using custom components or standard HTML elements isn't supported in UI Extensions at this time. We have seen some iframes implementations to support this, but we would rather to have 100% UIE flow without having to face a new one with iframe drawbacks.\nDo some of you already faced this use-case? Are you awara if, and when HubSpot will introduce such a new component?\nThanks all :slightly_smiling_face:",
