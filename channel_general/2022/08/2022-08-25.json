Since you have selected an internal page from the dropdown, it is instead returning a page ID, which is not populating the URL redirect. Normally with form modules, you use form tags, which the hubl appropriately handles to set the redirect based on the page ID returned, but since you are using a script embed from our form embed code, this option will not be available to you.”_\n\nWhat we did was add an external url in order to get that url redirect populated.\nWhat happened here is that in those pages the RedirectID was still populating and it looks like that generates a conflict and after those redirects were added the workflows stopped working.\n\nAfter lots of testing and trying things I realized that in the ones that the workflow was still triggering we did not have the RedirectID, and in the ones that were not working we still had it (even after changing the response back to inline message).\n\nWhat I had to do is hardcode that RedirectID to be an empty string and add a callback function after the form is submitted to add the redirect."
