    "text": "Hello, team!\nCurrently, I am working in the HubSpot Design Manager, where I am fetching and rendering data. When I switch to the Design Previewer, I can see the rendered data, which works perfectly.\nI have added a choice field manually from the \"Add Fields\" option and provided the required options. This field also renders correctly in the previewer.\nWhat I want to achieve is that, by selecting any option from this choice field, the rendered data should change based on the selected option.\nThe challenge I am facing is how to access this featured select field in the Design Manager code because I need to use the value of this select field in my code.\nCurrently, I am using a hardcoded value in my code, as shown below:\n```{% if row[\"13\"] == \"BMW\" %}```\nIf I can somehow access the value of the HubSpot featured select field, I can make this condition dynamic.",
