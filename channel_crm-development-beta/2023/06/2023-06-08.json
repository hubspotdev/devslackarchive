    "text": ":wave:  Hi, our teams would love to get some input from you all on the complexity of third-party data interactions that you have for custom cards use cases. Are you looking at performing simple CRUD operations with third-party APIs, or do you have use cases that require complex post-processing, or require multiple calls? Any information, along with some use cases to dive deeper would be useful for our teams.\n\nFeel free to schedule a call with me, or DM me, if you prefer that."
