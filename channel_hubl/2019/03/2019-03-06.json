Is there a way to display the topic pages like simple listings?\n\nIn my use case I have a lot of custom stuff on the regular listing page and want the topic pages to be very similar to the simple listings. I know I can just put the `{% if topic %}` within the regular listing code and then copy and paste the simple listing code within that if statement, but it seems very inefficient to do it this way."
