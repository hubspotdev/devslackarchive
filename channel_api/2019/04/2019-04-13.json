    "text": "Bit of a strange one updating deals through the API.\n\nWhen a deal is updated to “won” through the API, it shows as won in the pipeline view. It has a close date populated, as well as an amount.\n\nHowever, the deal does not appear in the beta Campaigns report with the associated campaign (either as \"closed deals\" or \"influenced revenue\")\n\nIf we move it back a stage in pipeline through the GUI, and then move it back to “won” in the GUI, it does appear in the beta Campaigns report.\n\nAnyone got any ideas?",
