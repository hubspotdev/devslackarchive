    "text": "Hello! It seems like the \"color.css\" property does not generate rgba when the opacity is set below 100%. For example, when `#0000, %30`  is chosen in the module Color Picker, the css property should generate the following: `rgba(0, 0, 0, .3)`. There is a workaround taking the |convert_rgb filter and manually setting the opacity, ex: `rgba(color.color|convert_rgb, color.opacity / 100)`, however, I believe the css property should do this for you.",

    "text": "Hi folks this is probably a basic question, apologies in advance\n\nI have the following String i.e.\n\n```{{ [create_with_escaped_characters_\"_'_&lt;_&gt;_&amp;_end] is equalto [create_with_escaped_characters_\"_'_&lt;_&gt;_&amp;_end] }}```\nthis actually doesn’t work because of the weird characters in the expression. I have tried adding `autoescape` tags to the string in order to get the past the problem however that doesn’t seem to work either for me. I looked <https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/blob/master/src/test/java/com/HubSpot/jinjava/lib/exptest/IsEqualToExpTestTest.java|here> for hints but maybe the expression passed is too complex? I guess I can solve it another way but would be nice to use the constructs that come shipped with the library.  Appreciate any guidance regarding the above.",
