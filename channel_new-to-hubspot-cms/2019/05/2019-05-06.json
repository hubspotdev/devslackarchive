    "text": "Hi all! Graphic and web designer/dev here, totally new to HubSpot (I'm currently going through the CMS for Developers cert).\nI've just been tasked with integrating HS with an iMis CMS (which I also have no experience with). I mostly just need to redirect the blog to a HubSpot one, create HS landing pages, replace forms, and add tracking codes, which all sound easy enough. However, if anyone has any relevant pointers/tips/articles, or if there's any roadblocks I might hit/I'm on the right track, a heads-up would be much appreciated!\nI'll be keen to ask plenty of questions. Cheers!",
