    "text": "Hi. We are creating a”resources” module  to display at the bottom of pillar pages. It would be <https://demo.giantfocal.com/march/module/image-box|this module> but instead of a grid or masonry layout, it would be a slider with arrows to pan it horizontally.  The idea would be that a visitor can scroll through a slider at the bottom to visit the other blog posts on the topic. However, we are wondering if the link and anchor text would be seen an indexed by Google’s web crawler, or would it somehow be hidden in the code? Both that which is visible and that those “cards” that are “off page” unless cycled over."
