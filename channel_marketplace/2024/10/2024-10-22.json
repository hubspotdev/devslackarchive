I'm wondering how long the process will take and who I should refer to in the dev team? There is no indication of response timeline on the landing page.\n\nAppreciate it :pray::skin-tone-3:",

Our SLA is usually a couple business days, especially since you submitted over the weekend.\n\nYou submitted your developer account Hub ID, `144589278`, twice rather than specifying app IDs as instructed. However, I'm guessing you want \"Simple Time Tracker\" (ID: `3561326`) and \"Simple Time Tracker (STT) [Staging]\" (ID: `3770934`) to have access, so I've gone ahead with that assumption. Please see your email for next steps."
