Basically I want to give the user the option to use a global module or a non-global module (page-specific settings) and the 2 modules are identical besides one being global and one being non-global. I can literally just clone the module and mark one as non-global and one as global, which is what I’m doing now, but then any time I want to update the code in the module, I have to update it in both the global and non-global modules, which isn’t desirable."

In my case, I am working on a button custom module.\nExpected: When I click on preview I want to see the button like in webpages (In other words: default CSS loaded).\nAre there any tips or solutions for this case? Also could you please share with me your solution if you have faced the same issue?",
