    "text": "Hi, is anyone currently using ON24 with HubSpot? Curious if you have insight to a better integration (than Scribe) to update HubSpot email communication and records with live updates from ON24 (like webinar link, attendance status, etc). Scribe is not working out for us and as a result, we're trying to see if we can host everything in HubSpot, but will need to automate the webinar link (from ON24) into HubSpot emails somehow. Anyone have a clue in how to optimize this process?",
