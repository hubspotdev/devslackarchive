To date, HubSpot hasn’t officially supported any libraries and many of them have lost their original maintainers and have then gotten out of date and bugs have gone unfixed.  Any help you are willing to provide for hapipy would be much appreciated.  Let me know how HubSpot can best help. We are actively considering what our role in the open source community should be"
