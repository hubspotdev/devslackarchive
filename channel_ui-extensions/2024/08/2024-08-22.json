    "text": "<@U03FJQPSC0Y> Yeah you're spot on. Honestly whether it's through context or an something like `fetchCrmObjectProperties` , it's all the same to us. It's just a bit of a pain to have fetch it via the api endpoints.\n\nAnother suggestion if you don't mind, and maybe it's not possible given your response, but even if we had the owner ID of the active user available through context or some other native means that would be great. The issue we're having is matching object owners to users... we can fetch the user id through context and the object's owner id using `fetchCrmObjectProperties` , but the values are completely different. The only way we can get both is through the Owners API endpoint."
