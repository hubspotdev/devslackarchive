I’ve spent some time working with API consumption, where requests from external static pages create records in the CRM with custom objects. But now, I’d like to know if it’s possible to set up an API to act as a decoder directly within the CRM. For example, by entering a Zip code in the “State” object, when I click “Create,” the API would automatically populate the address fields by consuming the data through a Private App.\nI'm having some trouble figuring out this next step—any tips would be greatly appreciated!",
