    "text": "Hi Gonzalo, thank you for asking a great question. If a customer purchases a Marketplace asset that is later removed from the Marketplace, they will continue to have access to the purchase within their portal. Purchased assets from the Marketplace are only removed from a portal if a customer chooses to delete/ uninstall the asset within their own portal.\nCustomers will not be able to receive updates as the listing will no longer be available within the Marketplace."
