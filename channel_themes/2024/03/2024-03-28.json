Additionally, I cannot see the name of the creator of the theme/template.  I want to replace the logo with the HubSpot Solutions Provider logo.  HubSpot advised me to reach out through this channel because they said it was a coding issue.  Can someone please advise?",

    "text": "Yes, it's a coding related issue. Firstly, take note of the name of the footer module. Then, you need to check in which theme this footer module is located by inspecting the design tools. Once you locate the html file, there should be a footer section where you'll find the path to the logo. If you need further assistance to fix the code, you're welcome to dm me."
