But there's also sub grades/reports, which would be their own custom objects.\n\nAnd I want to do this\n\n<http://example.com/grader/USERS_URL/report1|example.com/grader/USERS_URL/report1>\n<http://example.com/grader/USERS_URL/report2|example.com/grader/USERS_URL/report2>\n\nI think for now I can just do a separate dynamic page, based off of the second custom object\n\nSo like this\n\n<http://example.com/grader/report1/USERS_URL|example.com/grader/report1/USERS_URL>"
