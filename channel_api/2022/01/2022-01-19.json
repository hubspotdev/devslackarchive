One thing I am having trouble with is updating Schema properties (updating a properties label, adding new properties to an existing Schema etc...). I was wondering if it was possible, or is it that once the Schema has been created, the properties can't be updated?"

I followed this instruction \"<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/crm-extensions/crm-extensions-overview#handling-action-hooks>\" and everything worked so far to create a new CRM card.  But I see only one problem and I hope you guys can help me here. I added an a \"primaryAction\" to my widget with the \"type\": \"iframe\" within this action I create an entry in our platform but after this step was finished and the iframe was closed the CRM card is not reloaded automatically. Did I miss any option here to refresh my CRM card after I opened an iframe dialog or after I triggered an action?"
