This in turn contains the following module: `{% email_each list=\"deal.line_items\" item=\"line_item\" %}`. Can't find any documentation on this module. Can somebody provide more information? I understand it's looping through the line items from an associated deal but how does it determine which deal? Can it be used in other ways? Tell me more! :simple_smile:",
