    "text": "*Context:* We would like to use HubSpot meeting form on our integrations page and would like them to look similar to <https://amaka.com/integrations/square/quickbooks/|Amaka> and <https://www.bookkeep.com/accounting-automation-for-shopify-ecommerce-brands/|Bookkeeper>.\nRight now we created the meeting form, connected to calendar and set up it with an embed code, however it doesn't look the same (additional Frame added). We tried to make changes inside HuBspot setting, but there's nothing to set up it. Also I tried to change css styles with !important, but this is the first time in my life it didn't work. Can someone help resolving it please?\n\nTest page: <https://integrations-d4924c.webflow.io/xero-afterpayn>\nScreenshot (look thread): 1st form is from our sales team that has to be inserted without additional frame, 2nd one is mine with no frame initially",
