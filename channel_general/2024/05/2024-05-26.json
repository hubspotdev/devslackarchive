    "text": "Hello, hoping that this is the right place to ask:\nI have a client with several websites on HubSpot CMS. They want to make use of HubSpot Slide-in CTAs. However, on at least two pages the CTAs don't work as expected. Initially they wouldn't show up at all, then we fixed an issue with CookieBot and now they sometimes show up, but are not always clickable.\nI've noticed that I get an error in the console by pop-up.js (Uncaught Error: Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery).\nHas anyone experiences similar issues or know how to fix that?",
