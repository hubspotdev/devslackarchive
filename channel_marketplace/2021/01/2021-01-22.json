    "text": "Hi all\n\nI've been looking at the POWER HubSpot theme and we are possibly interested in purchasing it.\n\nWe have a current website with HubSpot (no theme currently installed). When you download a theme does it just add the pages and modules or will it affect the overall current website?\n\nOr will we have to develop a new website on a staging site? We have a lot of content on our website so creating a new website on a staging site isn't an option for us. We want to do it gradually page-by-page over time.\n\nThanks for your help\n\nAlex",
