    "text": "I would personally use a CSS grid setup to align the puzzle elements. The headings would then be individual text fields and the icons would be images. A lot depends on how much flexibility you want to give the module. Does it need to be 3 columns or would there be the option to have less or more. That would make it a lot more complicated, so to start I think sticking with 3 would be good."

    "text": "That is an approach you could take, but I would worry about responsiveness of the design. I would make the background areas the color of the puzzles and then use psudo elements for the overlapping parts. You would then be able to move the elements when you get to a mobile layout into a single column."
