    "text": "Hey all, i’m having problems with the Hubl tag `related_blog_posts` - Calling `related_blog_posts` without parameters does not return any posts, although i would expect it to return posts from across all blogs. This behaviour is on a portal where several blogs are set up, but not all of them contain posts yet.\nThe tag only works if i use a specific `blog_id` . I cannot figure out why and could not replicate the issue on another portal. Did somebody run into such a problem or can anybody help me with this?"
