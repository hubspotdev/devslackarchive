    "text": "Hello team,\n\nWe're building a custom integration between Quickbooks and HubSpot and we want to do the following.\nTo keep it simple:\n1- Once an invoice is created on Quickbooks, use the webhooks to send a request to the app with the invoice id.\n2- Fetch that invoice from within HubSpot and assign it to a deal.\n\nThe thing is, I'm trying to use the extensions API to get the Invoice details an then just create an association between the invoice and the concerned deal.\n\nIt's just that the API call isn't working ( I'm using Python ) and I don't know what I'm doing wrong, here it is:\n\n```params = {'accountId': account_id, \"hapikey\": HubSpot_API_KEY}\nr = requests.get(f'<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/extensions/accounting/invoice/invoice_id>', params= params)```\n*NOTE:*\n• I couldn't really find where to get the accountID from, so I just opened an invoice from ubspot and in the url, I took that accountId\n• I tried sending the request with 2 values of invoiceId, the one in HubSpot and the one in Quickbooks, and it still didn't work.\nThe error was \"Unable to deduce app-id from this request\"\n\nI updated the params dictionnary to the following\n```params = {'accountId': account_id, \"hapikey\": HubSpot_API_KEY, \"appId\": app_id} ```\nAgain, app_id was fetched from the url of the invoice opened in the browser.\n\nThis is still not working and getting the same error :disappointed: .\n\nWhat am I doing wrong and how can I solve this ?",
