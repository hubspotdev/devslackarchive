That would be in a perfect world.\n\nIt would help if I could simply reference `{{hubdb.table_name.row_id.column_name}}`  in any module via the rich text editor or any text input filed a module includes.\n\nI do realize the normal way to do this is with a single custom module that references the HubDB table."
