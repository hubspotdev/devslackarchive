So I lost all the text I have edited already and back to \"lorem ipsum...\" which is the text on the template.\nIs it a bug? or is it normal that when you change something on the template the landing or pages based on that template return to its original appearance and lost all the edition you made?  Becouse if that so, we won´t be able to change the template once we have public pages already, it is make not sense. It hadn´t happened to me before.",

That is, if you make a page, once its saved its contents are separate and no longer affected by the placeholder content used in the template editor.\nIf you deleted the original module and replaced with a new one, that would be considered a new module - the page doesn't know it's supposed to be the same one. Is it possible that that's what happened?"
