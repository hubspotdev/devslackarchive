    "text": "If you aren’t aware, I think about this all the time when I wonder why HubSpot won’t do something that wordpress:\nwordpress is open source, HubSpot is an america based publicly traded company that has a responsibility to put money into shareholders pockets. I don’t like saying that, but 5 people in one thread and what they are asking for isn’t looked at in the same breath as someone that wants different functionality and this opens the door to HubSpot selling more subscriptions. Those wordpress people that implement these items are doing it because they love programming and working on the project. We have developer teams and developer advocates, and they want to do the same thing for us, but eventually this goes to management and gets put on a roadmap or ignored.  Just so different.  Shopify and their liquid engine was created by the founder. They didn’t like options out there for ecom and built their own. they became a public company much later vs HubSpot\n\nNow — I think we can just ignore all of that, because in the long run it doesn’t matter why it is being ignored — you just want it implemented. So how do we do that? We use our voice.\n\nYou posted in here about it — I think posting in the message board and asking for it and sending people there is going to be a much more effective way to go about this. Share the page and ask others to go in there and comment. Maybe we can get some traction that way. It is in “idea submitted”"
