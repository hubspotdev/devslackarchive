    "text": "Hello,\n\nI am in the process of updating from the v1 API to v3 (late to the party, I know).\n\nMy organization uses the API to keep our Tableau reports up to date in as close to real time as possible, so we only want to see the records that have been updated recently.\n\nFor CRM objects I am accomplishing this by querying the SEARCH api filtered by hs_lastmodifieddate then sending each page of 100 ids to the BATCH READ endpoint.\n\nMy problem is with associations. I don't see any way to retrieve associations in batches. Retrieving them one id at a time will require too many api calls, and retrieving the entire list of objects with associations is too much data for the job that runs every 10 - 15 minutes to handle.\n\nI am just hoping someone here can point out something I've missed. Thanks in advance!",
