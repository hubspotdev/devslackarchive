The problem I'm having here is that the when the other buttons are clicked, they display the 1st content card message rather than the content that is filled out for itself. For example, button#2 and button#3 displays content 1 rather than content 2 and 3. I must be doing something fundamentally incorrect. Maybe the way the module is designed makes it impossible idk. I would like some help or advice on how I should approach this issue. Thanks :))",
