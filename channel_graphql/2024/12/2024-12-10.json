    "text": "Have any of you tried creating an orderBy functionality on your frontend, with which you pass the query to GraphQL as a variable?\nEssentially giving the visitor/editor the option to change the order of the content.\n\nIn GraphiQL it seems impossible to set up.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/cms/content/data-driven-content/graphql/query-HubSpot-data-using-graphql#query-argument-types> - `orderBy` is an Enum Array.\n\nWe pass variables as JSON, so strings. Setting up the variable type as either `HS_Enum`  or `[HS_Enum]` gives the same result:\n`VariableTypeMismatch: Variable type 'HS_Enum' doesn't match expected type xx`\n\nIf I type in my orderBy parameter directly, it works as it should, but - given that I want the user/editor to control the sorting, I need to pass it as a variable.\n\nExample:",

    "text": "why it's possible to filter HubSpot_team_id with the \"___in\"_ and the HubSpot_owner_id not ? there only \"__eq\" exists... this means to me If I'm right I cannot filter for more than 1 different users, if i want to filter in parallel for another OR combination like:\n\nquery filteredObjectsCollection {\n    CRM {\n        contact_collection(\n            limit: 500,\n            filter: {\n            OR: [{ email__eq: \"<mailto:test1@test.de|test1@test.de>\" },\n                { email__eq: \"<mailto:test2@test.de|test2@test.de>\" },\n           HubSpot_owner_id__eq: \"123456789\"\n}\n    ) {\n            items {\n                hs_object_id\n                email\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nor can I somehow AND 2 different ORs?"
