    "text": "Yea, it is a little weird that it doesn't set the default operator automatically when building from local. Funnily enough it seems to suddenly set it if you open the field while in design manager. When I first looked at the preview after coding it locally it functioned just as you explained, but after viewing the field in design manager it started functioning in preview as would be expected haha."

Based on my research so far, it seems like I can incorporate only simple fields, e.g. text fields, into a module.\n\nIt seems I can only add the field types that are available in the “Add Field” dropdown menu in the left-hand panel in the Design Tools/Design Manager.\n\nThank you!",
