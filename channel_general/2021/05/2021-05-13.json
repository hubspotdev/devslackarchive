    "text": "<@U021QM20QN9> Hi Holly, a couple of ideas, but you may have already considered them:\n[1] Pause for a generous amount of time (e.g. using setTimeout) -- this HubSpot article says your custom code action has max 20 seconds to execute, so keep that in mind: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/workflows/custom-code-actions>\n[2] Call the Salesforce API directly within the custom code action. Assuming the Salesforce API gives you a useful response, you could potentially use a promise to continue after response is received from Salesforce.\nIs that helpful at all?"

Depending on the time-sensitivity of the workflow continuing once the property has been updated in Salesforce, you could maybe consider adding sequential delays followed each time by a call to Salesforce API (via custom code action) to see if the property has been updated."
