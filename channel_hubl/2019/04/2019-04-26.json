    "text": "Did the regex validation for Display Conditions in Custom Modules recently change? One of mine that was working fine just a few hours ago is now showing as invalid and I'm unable to save the module. I'm not an expert with regex so I'm not sure if what I previously had was wrong, but all I'm trying to do is figure out the correct syntax for a Display Condition when the value matches one of a list of values and also the syntax for when the value matches none of a list of values. Previously I was using these and they worked perfectly, but now I just get an error:\n^(?=value1|value2)\n^(?!value1|value2)",
