This avoids the conflict of the parameters being the same.\n\nI’ve posted it to this forum thread first as it’s easier to see the formatting that way:\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/dnd-module-divider-width/m-p/406041/highlight/true#M20931>\n\nThank you for your patience on this."
