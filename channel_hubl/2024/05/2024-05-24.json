It’s showing *Labels* instead of internal *values*!\n• Quickly comment out all extra code to convert values to labels via dictionaries\n• Display the raw properties (now are Labels) instead.\n• Client templates working again. \nIt would have been nice to know instead of causing a sales-team outage mid Friday :)"
