    "text": "Hello.  I am blocked and would love some help please.  I'm writing some hubl within a custom module.  My goal is to access more (ideally all) of the values associated with the properties that I have stored in my custom data object ('CDO').  I'm using code like this to access a dictionary of property name and values for a specific custom data object:  {% set thisCDO = crm_object(\"fullyQualifiedName\", id)%} then when I enter {{thisCDO}} I am returned a very short dictionary with type items {CDO_id = number, id = number}} I defined CDO_id as a primary display property when I set the object up - so perhaps that is why it is coming back.  What I want help with is: How do I get a complete(or more complete) dictionary of properties and values returned.  So, for example, I also defined a property called CDO_balance (a number field) that I would love to be able to return for the website viewer to see.  Any ideas?  Thanks Dave",
