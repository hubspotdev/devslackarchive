The problem is, I can’t control the markup of those images that get output onto the page at the template level, so the task to modify the markup is left up to the editor of the page. But I think your mention of lazy loading has helped me find a solution - so thanks!\n\n(Link here for those of you wondering what the solution could be → <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Share-Your-Work/Lazy-Load-Images-in-the-Rich-Text-Editor-module/td-p/255148>)"
