I’d like files to be removed from the destination portal when they’re removed from the source. I figured that `hs watch` is probably powering it under the hood, but passing `--remove` gives an “Unknown option” error.\n\nI also noticed that the URL for the `@HubSpot/webpack-cms-plugins` GitHub repo redirects to the `@HubSpot/HubSpot-cli` repo now — have the Webpack plugins been depreciated?"
