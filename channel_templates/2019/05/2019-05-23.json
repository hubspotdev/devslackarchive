In this template there will be general settings that will be customizable by the user who does not know anything about coding. Its  parameters are for example the primary colors :art:of the site, button aspects in general ... Do you have an idea how can I develop this part to make it as easy as possible.\n\nThank you in advance :slightly_smiling_face:\n<@U22PKFRU5>"
