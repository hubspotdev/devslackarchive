    "text": "Hi there everyone, I’m just starting to dive a bit deeper in to API implementations and I have a question - How do I determine the  proper path using dot notation when working with the HubSpot api client?\n\nRight now, I’m trying to make a call to one of the form endpoints, but the path comes back invalid, I suppose because I don’t have the “?hapikey=&lt;apikey&gt;” portion at the end, which I thought would be unnecessary since I instantiate the hubSpotClient variable with an api key that I’ve saved elsewhere as the ‘key’ variable.\n\n\n   `const HubSpotClient = new HubSpot.Client({ apiKey: process.env.key });`\n\n\n `HubSpotClient.apiRequest({`\n            `method: 'GET',`\n            `path: '<https://api.hubapi.com/form-integrations/v1/submissions/forms/cd83f69f-35a1-48dd-a6d8-fddb153466a8>' ,`\n          `}).then(results =&gt; {console.log(\"hi\" + results)`\n  `})`\n  `.catch(err =&gt; {`\n    `console.error(err)`\n  `})`\n`}`\n\nI’ve seen other implementations where the call is made via dot notation, how does one determine the proper syntax using this method? I’m trying to keep this as secure as I can.",
