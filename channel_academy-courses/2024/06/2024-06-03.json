    "text": "Trying to go through the training to get the HubSpot dev certification but MOST of the content is outdated. The majority of what's being shown is not how the site is set up ... such as accessing file manager, accessing settings, etc.\n\n<https://academy.HubSpot.com/courses/cms-for-developers?library=true&amp;=>\n\nEven the command for adding the HubSpot boilerplate to vs code has changed. It took me over an hour to find the correct npm command.\n\nIs there an updated version of the training where ALL of the modules showcase the HubSpot dev environment the way that it looks today?"
