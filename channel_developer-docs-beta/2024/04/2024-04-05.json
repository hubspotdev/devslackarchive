Really love the \"What's new\" section - just one quick thing about the navigation(first page):\nIt would be extremly benefitial/time saving if there would be quicklinks or so like in the screenshot(I've just made that up to visualize)\n\nAlso - since it seems to be narrower than the current version(i know the container is wider), would a lightbox feature for images be an thing?",
