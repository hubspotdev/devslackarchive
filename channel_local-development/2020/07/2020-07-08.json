    "text": "Hey <@U013TUP19PS> An alternative to doing all of your building in a sandbox portal would be to do the entire build in content staging. Honestly this is prob one of the best ways to do it. Especially if youre making use of converting over to a theme and all of your templates and modules are already encapuslated in the theme folder.\n\nThis way you never have to worry about porting anything over into the new portal. You can just do it all in their current portal - plus you can link all of the pages with their new counterparts so they all go switch “at the same moment”"
