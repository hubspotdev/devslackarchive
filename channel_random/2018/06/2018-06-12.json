We previously had linkedin logins but the apis weren't stable enough and we didn't have much usage at all. For the moment we've decided not to press ahead with adding this feature as the work involved was far too high for the payoff our customers would see. But if you feel it would be useful I'd definitely encourage you to kudos and comment on that ideas post!"
