I've created a private app to this end, and I would like to publish certain activities on the timeline of a company or contact when events happen in the web app.\n\nI'm trying to follow this documentation page: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/timeline> but quickly running into trouble because I cannot add Event Templates to my app (the page looks different from the screenshots in this documentation).\n\nMight this be a difference between public and private apps? But surely I am able to post events to the timeline when using a private app?\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

I believe this should be done through the engagements API but I can't seem to get the endpoints correct. I'm using a private app that should have permissions and I'm not having any trouble with the v1 API, but some v3 API endpoints are giving me trouble.\n\n```headers = {\n    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}',\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n}\n\ncontact_id = 'XXXXX'\nassociations_url = f'<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/{contact_id}/associations/notes>'```\nFor example, this fails. The documentation still has examples that use Hapikey some I'm not sure if my URL is off my understanding of associations and objects is off. I'm getting a 404 Not Found.\n\nThis works:\n```headers = {\n        'Authorization': f'Bearer {at}',\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n    }\n\napi_url = '<https://api.hubapi.com/events/v3/events/?objectType=contact&objectId=XXXXX>'```\nSo and I have been able to make many other calls using the API so I know the app is set up find.\n\nThanks",
