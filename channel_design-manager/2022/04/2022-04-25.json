    "text": "Hi everyone, I love this Slack space for HubSpot nerds. If anyone needs anything please let me know I am very resourceful and connection rich, pretty tech savvy too!\n\nOur organization hosts college students for academic credit. One of our students is really concerned that our *PRINT button on the student recipe blogs* they create that it doesn't actually work. I am unsure how to fix this. Any advice?\n\nThe print feature with picture and without on my raw HTML code is not working.(<https://www.assuaged.com/news/one-pot-plant-based-mexican-soup>)\n\nI did find this *<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16894683/how-to-print-html-content-on-click-of-a-button-but-not-the-page|resource here>*. It seems that the Print Button housed in a custom module with code that I'm not familiar with.  Looking at the code, it appears that a link to actually _print_ that page is missing. *<https://docs.google.com/document/d/12eD13QB_FGcy67IFTcspdWQV3lR5TshBgFVGnnfbm4c/edit?usp=sharing|>&gt; Here is the code &lt;&lt;&gt;* we have on our end from HubSpot Design Manager. Thank you so much!!",

Do you know where the ccmpr function lives?\n\nI don’t know what the ccmpr function does but you could change the onclick attribute from `ccmpr();` to `window.print();`. This will fix the print issue but you have a lot of print styles issues as well."
