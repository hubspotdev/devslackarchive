It won't always make sense to keep those field types in the style tab.\n\nBradley's example being one and for another instance: I have a hero module that let's you choose a background type between Image, Gradient, Color, and Video. Video is not allowed in the Style tab but the other 3 are now ONLY allowed in the style tab. Separating them would be confusing to the end user. They choose video and the video options are right there but they choose any of the others and they're now forced to go to the Style tab to make the changes they want.\n\nAnd as Markus has stated moving fields around is going to cause breaking changes for those already using the themes. Are we just supposed to send out an email telling all of our downloaders \"Sorry, but you're going to have to go through every single one of your pages and re-make any edits you made to these specific fields\"."

Not every one finds the organization ya'll are now trying to enforce easy to use and understand. One of the things users look for in a theme is a field organization that works for _them_ and this limits one of the ways a builder can make their theme unique. This is really a step backwards."

    "text": "We have the same issue as Alyssa describes. For our background settings we use file-pickers for *.mp4 videos and text/URL fields for e.g. Youtube/Vimeo videos. These are content fields and thus not allowed to be moved to the style tab. Currently, these are conditional fields depending on the background type selected. Not sure if it would make sense to have a visibility setting for those content fields at all. Because it would be controlled via fields from the style tab.\nThey could be shown permanently, but both options are a bit weird.\n\nFor Bradleys example. I think choice fields could also be moved to the style tab, so the context would not necessarily break?\n\nI guess my biggest concern is restructuring module fields without introducing breaking changes to existing customers. Even if there are technical possibilities to do so, it is a very delicate action. And with large number of fields it will also take time to assure nothing will break. And if we are taking on that challenge, we might as well rethink our whole module field structure.\nI am a bit worried that this might block us from releasing updates from May, because this can easily grow into a bigger Milestone."

    "text": "Ah, now I get it. Thanks Bradley.\nActually, repeaters are a very good example. As of now I cannot imagine a way to move any color fields defined within a repeatable over to the style tab. That would be a breaking change. Also, how could those colors be configured otherwise? In another repeater? Please no :smile:\nEither it should be an exception within repeaters or colors should generally be allowed in both tabs.\n\nI find the new field types available in the style tab motivating enough to move fields over to the style tab on the long term. Not that we are not pleased with our current structure. We like it and our customers also like it. There are no real drawbacks with that solution. But, If we would make a fresh start, we would definitely leverage the style tab with its new UI elements."
