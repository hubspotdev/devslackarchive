    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI wanted to migrate the web traffic HubSpot analytics data into the SQL server. So have tried using the Analytics API but got a permission error. (Should have the enterprise account access).\nAlso tried to fetch the HubSpot analytics data using OAuth connection but couldn't do it.\nIs there any other way we can fetch the HubSpot analytics data except the manual export option?.\n \nCan we able to integrate the HubSpot analytics data into google analytics and then migrate it to SQL server?.\n \nLooking for some suggestions or help on this issue.\nWill be glad if anyone has done this before or any suggestions are welcome."
