Even though the schema I added works, it keeps showing an error in the Google test within an extra unnamed item (website type schema, despite me only adding an organization schema). The syntax error is within the searchbox for sitelinks 's PotentialAction{target} area.\n\nI tried adding a <meta name=\"google\" content=\"nositelinkssearchbox\"> within the header code, robot.txt, and even changing the original schema, but nothing helped.\n\nIs this something that just takes time? Or can I adjust it somewhere else?",
