Why you'd want to use richtext for this but regardless, i would just use a text field or an image field depending on what you're trying to actually do.\n\nI'm assuming you are trying to pull a contacts field value. If thats the case theres no need to do this rich text editor hack just put the hubl directly in your custom module or template"

Is there a way that HS can add a small alt tag to this. Even if its something like the company name or name it beacon or something",
