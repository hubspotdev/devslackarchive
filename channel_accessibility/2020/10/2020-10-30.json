This would be resolved by adding a role=“dialogue” to the thank you message.\n\nBecause we cannot edit form thank you message source code, I am going to have to do this with javascript adding that role to divs with the “submitted-message” class. Not the end of the world.\n\nPosting here though to see if this is something on HubSpot’s radar. Adding it to all portals would be a big help for all websites using HS forms.",
