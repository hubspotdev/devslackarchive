    "text": "[UPDATE: RESOLVED]\nSolved (and caused)  my own problem, at least on chrome- for anyone else who blocks all cookies by default, the solution is to add exceptions not only for the domain in question (e.g. i had allowed all cookies for `<http://mywebsite.com|mywebsite.com>` ) *but to also add an exception for HubSpot cookies.* In hindsight this is obvious, but it had me confounded for a while.\n\nFor good measure i used the wildcard tokens for the domain whitelisting: `[*.]<http://mywebsite.com|mywebsite.com>` and `[*.]<http://HubSpot.com|HubSpot.com>` both seemed to be necessary to make it work.\n\n-----------\n[ORIGINAL POST BELOW]\nHi all, wondering if anyone can shed light on why the “HubSpot Tools” sprocket may not be showing up on a live site? I’ve tried everything from cookies to disabling extensions, alternate browsers etc. This has been quite the handicap as it’s the only way I know of to access the detailed developer info view without manually printing individual debug data points from HuBL.\n\nTo clarify, it’s not showing up on ANY HubSpot site. I am logged in to the correct portal.\n\nI found two threads on the forums with similar issues but no solutions have worked for me:\n• <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Blog-Website-Page-Publishing/Can-t-see-HubSpot-sprocket-icon-on-live-site/m-p/298805>\n• <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Blog-Website-Page-Publishing/Can-t-see-HubSpot-Tools-sprocket-icon-on-live-sites/td-p/679788>\nAny insight is appreciated, thanks",
