I'm not sure I chose the right channel so feel free to redirect :slightly_smiling_face:\nWe want to track visitors activity on our wordpress website and receive information as in the picture.\n<https://drive.google.com/file/d/18jCM2FDtbOM23bh0tOWsK-lSytk6ZxmU/view?usp=sharing>\nWe have already added HubSpot Embed Tracking Code and now we are trying to deal with Tracking Code API. Could somebody please tell me what should I add in our code to make it work properly?\nShould I use this construction to track visitors?\n`var _hsq = window._hsq = window._hsq || [];` \n`let urlPath = String(window.location.pathname) ;` \n `_hsq.push(['setPath', urlPath]);` \n\nThanks in advance.",
