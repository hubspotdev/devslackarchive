    "text": "Good morning everyone, quick question - I have blog posts in two language variations, English and Danish.  To render them in the template file, I use this\n\n*{% related_blog_posts* \n    *limit=100,* \n    *callback=\"blog_post_formatter\"*\n*%}*\n\nIt works great, but the language of the current page gets ignores and it always pulls English variations of the blogposts, even on the Danish blog page. Is there some parameter I have to add, maybe? I can't see anything in the documentaiton."
