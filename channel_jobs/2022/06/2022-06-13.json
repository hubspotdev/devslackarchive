    "text": "Paid One Time Project: Looking for someone that can help with custom HubSpot development surrounding 1 quote template. Would need a relatively quick turnaround. Custom coding needed primarily to add in additional line items separate from the ones pulled in by default on the quote, so the client can add in “recommended products”. Outside of this there are a few visual coding actions that will need to be executed as well, but these are far less complex.",
