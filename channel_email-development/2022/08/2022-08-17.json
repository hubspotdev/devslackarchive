    "text": "Thanks for the response <@U03MJJ5Q4AG>! Atm, most of our users are from 10 timezones, but we want to send to all of them so probably all timezones.\n\n&gt; Other option would be to clone the email, create lists based on your time zone property, and schedule to send for each zone.\nFew questions regarding your suggestion:\n• Can this process be automated not just for the existing emails but also for future ones?\n• Does it mean that we're duplicating a contact record?"

    "text": "• Can this process be automated not just for the existing emails but also for future ones?\nNot in a way I can think of :disappointed: Once you make your lists, you won’t need to recreate those - it would be active lists based on contact property [Product Country] = country 1, [Product Country] = country 2, etc. But when you build your email it would be Email 1 - ET, then clone it x however many time zones.\n\n• Does it mean that we’re duplicating a contact record?\nNope! You just need to add an additional property to the contact and map your Product Country to that field, and use that for your lists."

    "text": "My thoughts are the same as Amber’s. Create an active list for each timezone, and then have 1 timezone list assigned to each email.\n\nSo if you have 10 timezones, you’re looking at 10 lists, and then 10 emails for the campaign, scheduled to send for each timezone accordingly."
