    "text": "Hi everyone, I am attempting to completely redo the blog page on a website using HubSpot cms and I am wondering how to replace the existing blog layout. I would like to create a separate template from the existing one and then make the new one active when I am finished working on it. Can anyone tell me if this is possible or how I can go about switching the active template/creating a new separate template?",
