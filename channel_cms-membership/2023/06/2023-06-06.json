    "text": "Hello everyone.\nI read about a new membership property, namely _Member Email_, which is available to all portals by default and it's useful, for example, when there is private content to be accessed via membership.\nNow, I'm a bit at a loss because from this <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/new-member_email-field-for-cms-membership-emails|page> it looks like it's the email to send membership related information to and NOT to log in:\n```This property is not the email address used by the member contact when they want to log in, member_email only controls where membership emails are sent. This means the user will continue to login to their account using the email address in the email contact property.```\nHowever, on this <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/website-pages/require-member-registration-to-access-private-content#change-a-contact-s-member-email|page> it is described as follows:\n```Member email: the email address the contact uses to log into private content. This email address will receive registration invitation emails, password confirmation emails, and password reset emails.```\nspecifying a couple of lines above:\n```If a contact's email address is changing, users with the permissions to edit that contact can change the Email and Member email properties to reflect this. \n\nFor security reasons, it's recommended to require emails from both the contact's listed email address and the email address they want to receive emails at moving forward.```\nIt seems that this member email should be updated along with the standard email field for security reasons and I haven't fully understood yet if this member email is the email both to log in and to receive membership info. If so, what's the point of using it?"
