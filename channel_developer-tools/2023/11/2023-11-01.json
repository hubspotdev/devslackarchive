    "text": "Hi Guys, Do anyone have idea how to use date range to filter records in HubSpot GraphQL APIs? I can retrieve records for the last 30 days or more but if I want to filter the records for current month or quarter then how can I achieve that in the query? Any help is much appreciated.\n```query shipmentData ($hs_object_id: String!) {\n    CRM {\n      company(uniqueIdentifier: \"hs_object_id\", uniqueIdentifierValue: $hs_object_id) {\n        associations {\n          p_shipments_collection__shipments_to_company(filter: {hs_createdate__gt: \"-30d\"}) {\n            items {\n              bol\n              cost\n              hs_object_id\n              hs_createdate\n              margin\n              revenue\n            }\n            total\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }```"
