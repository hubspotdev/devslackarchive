    "text": "Hey all, in the past I've used the onFormSubmit event on CMS pages to redirect to a different page based on a dropdown answer and it's worked well, e.g. below:\n```window.addEventListener('message', event =&gt; {\n  if(event.data.type === 'hsFormCallback' &amp;&amp; event.data.eventName === 'onFormSubmit') {\n    for (item in event.data.data) {\n      if (event.data.data[item][\"name\"] == \"favourite_fruit\") {      \n         \n          if (event.data.data[item][\"value\"] == \"bananas\") {\n            window.location = \"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana>\";\n          }\n        \n      }\n    }  \n  }\n});```\nI'm using this on an external site with an embedded HubSpot form with no luck, although it does enter the condition. Is the window.location not going to work because embedded forms are in iframes?",
