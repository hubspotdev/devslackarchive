    "text": "Hello! Are there any known bugs surrounding the `?hsLang` feature? It seems like `/?hsLang=en` on root \"/\" (homepage) does not redirect to the English version of the page, however, it does so on any subpages. It also works when redirected from a different language than the primary one (ex: `/sv/?hsLang=en` on homepage works). Also note it's only affecting English, `/?hsLang=sv`  works."
