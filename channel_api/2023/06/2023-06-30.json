Most of my API usage so far has been restricted to workflow custom code actions or one time scripts run locally. Might be a silly question but I haven't really looked at marketing events until today when I was asked to. Still haven't really wrapped my head around what the events are. Are they just aggregated data from external sources or can you actually add events directly to HubSpot?"
