You have to ensure, that you are accepting the right scopes for the planed requests to HubSpots API Endpoints.\n\nIf the integration is supposed to be used by multiple portals, you would instead create a HubSpot developer account and create a public app. The difference between public app and private app is the amount of work needed for authentication as public apps require you to implement the HubSpot Authorization Flow with OAuth2.\n\nI guess I need a bit more info to be of service - I am a freelance Dev / Solution Architect that works with HubSpot Integrations every day."
