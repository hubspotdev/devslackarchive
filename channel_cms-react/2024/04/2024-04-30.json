    "text": "Hi CMS React devs!\n\nFor those of you who use TypeScript, in v0.15.8 of `@HubSpot/cms-dev-server` we’ve added a new argument (`--generateFieldsTypes`) to the dev server that will automatically generate types based on the fields object you export in your modules, and watch for any updates made. This type file will be created in the same directory as your module and then you can then use it to type the `fieldValues` prop in your module component by including the new type as the generic of `ModuleProps<T>`.  To find out more, see <https://github.HubSpot.com/cms-react/reference/cms-dev-server.html#fields-type-generation|this entry in the docs> , and here’s a demo of this feature in action:",
