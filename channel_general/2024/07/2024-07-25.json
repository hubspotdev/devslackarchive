    "text": "I can't speak to your wanting to launch an iframe action in a modal - but I can tell you the difference between a private app and a public app is a private app is what you want if you only need your app for one specific HubSpot portal and it provides a private token for authentication.  You set up a private app in the portal at Settings->Integrations->Private Apps.  A public app on the other hand needs to authenticate with OAuth and public apps can be used on multiple portals, and as such can be released as Marketplace apps to the masses.  You will need to set up a developer account and create your app along with testing portals from there.  <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/private-apps>  <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/creating-an-app>  <https://developers.HubSpot.com/get-started>"
