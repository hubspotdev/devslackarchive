    "text": "Generally, I’d recommend avoiding clientOnly islands unless you have a specific need (especially if it is above the “fold”). Some other thoughts:\n• If the rough height of the final HTML is known a min-height is a great start (to at least not “push around” other elements on the page)\n• Even if you don’t know the height (like if there could be X different things in a list rendered depending on things, setting some minHeight (for 1-2 items) is helpful.\n• ^ is especially true for mobile, where maybe “save” up a few hundred pixels of vertical space reduces a lot of jumpiness\n• Make sure your placeholder space uses similar background color to the later client-rendered content\n• If you can render some of the content on the server, but not all you can do things like use visibility: hidden with placeholder content (that is later rendered “for real” and revealed\n• ^ is especially useful for text things like labels, dates/timestamps, etc\n• I haven’t used <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-placeholder> or <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-placeholder-loading> but they looks interesting"
