I know I can create translations in custom modules, but I can't find documentation on how to detect what's triggering that translation, so I can't use it directly in a template"

I am able to still select modules but I dont get any kind of highlight or anything. But once I select the modules I cannot then try to back out of the module and select a section in order to edit the background-color or width etc without reloading the page again.",
