Example: jQuery being loaded in header, this only affects users on the first page load significantly. Seeing as they use the HubSpot CDN for jQuery odds are the file is already cached on the users machine meaning there is no download time for the file. Google page speed however docks like 15 to 20 points over that."

The idea being that we act more like a dev department inside of your company than an outsourced agency. Most of our work is actually this way. We have a few marketing agencies that have decided not to hire internal developers because they found it just way easier to work with us than train someone up to where we’re already at.\n\nWe’re all inbound certified and know digital marketing, design certified. I’m not a marketer or a sales guy, so I’m done pushing things, if things don’t work out with hiring a freelancer feel free to reach out, I’m always online on the HS slack."

There are teams that have been making dreams reality when they are over 1000 miles away from each other. I wish you luck in finding some locally -- I'd look to here: <http://chicago.HubSpotusergroups.com/> or reaching out to your HubSpot sales rep if you are trying to find a freelancer/partner that is local.  If not -- there are plenty of options that can assist you without being on site."
