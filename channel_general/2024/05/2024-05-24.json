I just created a column of type location, but it seems like there is a bug which prevents me from inputing a location into rows.\nIn the screenshot below you can see that there is something wrong on how HubSpot communicates with bing maps in `errorDetails` .\n\nSo far I’ve tried it on different portals (sandbox and deployed client portals), using browsers, and I’ve disabled all the extensions to make sure it’s not an issue with my local machine but no luck so far.\n\nEdit: It works if I drag and drop the marker, but the search bar is not functional.\n\nUsing the drag and drop takes ages, since I have to really zoom in the map, and adding 100 rows will take ages.\nFor now I am using google maps to find all the coordinates and then adding them to a `.csv` file, which I then import to hubDB. But once I deploy the feature to the clients live portal, this way of working will not do it!",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I didn’t find a way to use the standard embeds — in this particular case, we wound up going with a practical workaround rather than figuring out a technical solution. That said, I have since been made aware of one potential solution that might do the trick _(credit to the phenom <@U01Q3GPCK7F> for making me aware of this one)_.\n\nThe HubSpot forms script (`v2.js`) lets a number of its methods be called publicly — including the one that initializes and renders forms. So, if you used form targets that looked like `&lt;div data-hs-form-id=\"YOUR_FORM_ID\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`, you could theoretically render them using a function along these lines:\n```function initHsForms() {\n  const formTargets = document.querySelectorAll('data-hs-form-id');\n\n  formTargets.forEach(formTarget =&gt; {\n    const formId = formTarget.getAttribute('data-hs-form-id');\n\n    hbspt.forms.create({\n      region: 'na1',\n      portalId: 'YOUR_PORTAL_ID',\n      formId: formId,\n      target: `[data-hs-form-id=${formId}]`,\n      css: '',\n      onFormReady(form) {\n        // Form ready callback\n      },\n      onFormSubmit() {\n        // Form submit callback\n      },\n    });\n  });\n}```\nThere’d be some timing and sequencing trickiness to sort out (ensuring the method is loaded and available by the time you run your function), but I imagine it _should_ get the job done without putting _too_ heavy of a burden on your marketers."
