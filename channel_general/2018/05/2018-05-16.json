Change the option to display a response after submit so it's easier to manage and you won't need that iframe.\n\nIf for some reason you can't change that option then, you can submit the data through the API with AJAX:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form>\nbut consider that you will need to manage your own validation etc."

However when the template email is populated with the hidden token, the URL variable shows \"undefined\".  Any ideas on how to get the workflow to capture and push the data to the correct email template?"
