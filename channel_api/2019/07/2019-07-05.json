    "text": "Hi Community,\nDoes anyone know if this is possible?\nSituation: I have a form that was not built in HubSpot but using the forms api to map submissions to <http://HubSpot.As|HubSpot.As> a next step I hope to map information that is was not on a field in the form but relevant information on the submission and have it be sent to a custom property in HubSpot\nExample:Someone fills out a form they are interested in buying a honda accord. They enter first name, last name, phone number. I want to pass the information about the car that's not on the form to HubSpot\n-Year of manufacture\n-Mileage\n-Model type",

    "text": "Hey, <@UEZJ74UN8>! You can pass whatever custom information you need through the Forms API, so this is certainly possible.\n\nHow are you currently making calls to the Forms endpoint? Are you taking all the form fields and making a client-side `POST` to HubSpot, or are you calling your back end first?\n\nAt a high level, you’ll need to query wherever this custom data is stored and combine it with the form field data before submitting to the endpoint."

See this related Community post: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Create-a-user-using-the-API/m-p/227311>.\n\nIf you’d like to see this feature in the future, please comment on this idea (<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/REST-API-FOR-USERS-AND-TEAMS/idi-p/25772>) with your use case."
