    "text": "we suspect there is a bug that occurs when importing a contact using a HubSpot_ALTERNATE_ID. If we create a contact with an email in HubSpot and then import a contact with the same email using our HubSpot_ALTERNATE_ID to fill in extra parameters, we get a \"Duplicate unique property value\" error on our alternate id. We believe this is a bug because there is no contact records existing with the same id, it is instead erroring on duplicate emails as it is wrongly trying to insert a contact rather than updating it by falling back on the email. Please help? is this correct ?",
