    "text": "Here's a random one:  Anyone in here an expert in the use of `border-image` for linear gradient borders?\n\nI'm working on a project right now where I have elements with a gradient border, and it seems like the best bet for this use case... The problem is, I'm running into a fairly odd issue.  When I sent out a preview link to my coworkers, the gradient borders that are showing up for me aren't for them, even if we're all viewing the page in the same browser.\n\nLong story short, would you mind having a look at this preview and tell me if you're seeing borders on the elements?\n\n<https://www.visioncritical.com/-temporary-slug-87c8ced8-8af9-4e1d-8790-8b33505a718a?hs_preview=XTeXXmVY-11201264331>",
