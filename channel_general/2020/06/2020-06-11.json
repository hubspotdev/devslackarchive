    "text": "Hello! I'm hoping I can maybe get some help with some code I'm working on. I'm building a resource library here <http://www.mydonoraccess.com/resource> based on this tutorial deal here <https://designers.HubSpot.com/code-gallery/entry/founders/katelynae-HubDB-Resource-Library>. Bunch of code is missing from the download especially the code having to do with the double filter. So if you look at the first example in the filter, I have an extra &lt;option&gt;....&lt;/option&gt; being brought in. My filters are on lines 65 and 86. I'm pretty sure it's looping over my array twice because of the way the queryparam (line 115) is written. Think I need to somehow combine those two arguments into on and I'm a bit of a gumby and stuck with it. Can any of you guys lend me a hand with it?"
