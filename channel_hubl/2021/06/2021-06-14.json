    "text": "Hey everyone,\nI have an issue regarding the fetching of line items that are associated with a deal in the template of a quote.\nAt the moment HubSpot has an “issue” where it limits the amount of line items shown in the deals to 99, even though the deal has more than 99 line items associated with it. This issue then propagates to the “template_data” that I work with on the template because I lose access to all the line items and instead only have access to 99.\nEven though using JavaScript to fetch the information I need is probably the best solution I would like to keep that as a last resort and work with HubL if I can.\nThe closest solution that I came across was using the “crm_associations” function (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/functions#crm-associations>) and fetching all the line items that are associated with the deal that I am working with and indeed this approach works, but only locally. As the warning says, unless the published quote is password protected then the method will not return any results.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to how I can access all the line items associated with the deal?\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks!"
