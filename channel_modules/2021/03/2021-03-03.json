    "text": "If you have development experience creating a custom module for this is fairly straight forward. I recommend reading the HubSpot docs - <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started>\n\nThe building blocks for this module would be:\n1. A repeating group with an image field inside (or just a repeating field - depends how flexible you need it to be)\n2. Some CSS and HTML for the grid.\nAlternatively you can use the off-the-shelf HubSpot core modules and build it using the image module and drag-and-drop. However, you’d still need to style it :slightly_smiling_face:"

With your suggestions and some input from the HS community forums, I was able to get this working. \n \nI was able to use the field groups with an image module and URL module within it. I then could look over the fields and add some styling to get the layout/functionality I wanted."
