    "text": "Hi there, I'm new to HubSpot Developers and this Slack Community! Sorry if the question has already been raised:\nI'm trying to create a section in it's one file of a Drag and Drop area without much success, even after looking at the documentation about the sections:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/templates/drag-and-drop-areas/sections>\n1. I've created a section file (partial template as an html file) and added the required header : Section1.html\n```&lt;!--\n templateType: section\n label: Section1\n description: \"Section1\"\n isAvailableForNewContent: true\n--&gt;\n{{ standard_header_includes }}\n&lt;!-- Begin partial --&gt;\n{% dnd_section background_color={r:100, g:210,b:200, a:1}, \n padding={\n   'top': 200,\n   'right': 20,\n   'bottom': 200,\n   'left': 20\n },\n max_width=778,\n vertical_alignment='MIDDLE'\n%}\n {% dnd_column %}\n   {% dnd_row %}\n    \n   {% end_dnd_row %}\n {% end_dnd_column %}\n{% end_dnd_section %}\n {{ standard_footer_includes }}\n&lt;!-- End partial --&gt;```\n2. I've required the section in the dnd area of the file TestDnD.html but the section doesn't appear in the list of available Custom Sections Right Panel when the page is in Editor mode\n```{% dnd_area \"ez5\" label=\"some dnd 5\" %}\n        {% dnd_section background_color={r:150, g:200,b:200, a:1}, padding={top: 50, bottom: 10, right: 0, left: 0} %}\n              {% dnd_column \"col1\" width=4, background_color={r:200, g:201,b:202, a:1} %}\n                    {% dnd_row \"row1\"  %}\n                    {% end_dnd_row %}\n              {% end_dnd_column %}\n    \n              {% dnd_column \"col2\" width=8, offset=4 %}\n                    {% dnd_row \"row2\"  %}\n                    {% end_dnd_row %}\n              {% end_dnd_column %}\n        {% end_dnd_section %}\n      \n       {% include_dnd_partial path='/DnDTest/Section1.html' %}\n      \n{% end_dnd_area %}```\nDoes someone know how to make this work or does know what I am missing or don't understand ?\nThanks a lot!",
