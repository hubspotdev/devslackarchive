Basically when a user clicks on a `&lt;div&gt;` it creates a video overlay that shows a youtube video in the middle of the page that I'd like to add a dark see-through overlay in the background.  I have the video working as intended however the dark overlay is only showing at the top of the page instead of covering the entire DOM, any suggestions?"

Do I have to custom code a video lightbox or does HubSpot have a module for this common user functionality? I see that <@ULH765N65> is working on something that plays a youtube video, and it looks like he is coding from scratch. Yikes. A ~video~ lightbox is so common that it seems there should be a HubSpot module for that already, right?",
