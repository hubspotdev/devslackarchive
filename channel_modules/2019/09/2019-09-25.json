    "text": "Edit:Solved :slightly_smiling_face:\nTrying to get this to work but getting an error which means I can’t publish it.\n\nBasically since we can’t nest modules, I thought why not put a macro in a template partial that does the code then we can just include that template partial in the modules (still means you have to duplicate the fields in the module but you don’t have to copy and paste the hubl+html)\n\nSo the code\nIn the module\n```{% include '/Custom/test-partial.html' %}\n{{ test_partial() }}```\n\nAnd the partial\n```{% macro test_partial() %}\n\t{{module.title}}\n{% endmacro %}```\n\nAdd a title field to the module\nHit the preview button and it works\nHowever the error says\n```1. Error:4:0 Could not resolve function 'test_partial'\n2. Warning:1:1 'include' is not recommended in this context```\nSo obviously HubSpot doesn’t detect the presence of the macro to validate the module, Has anyone got any thought’s to get around this?",
