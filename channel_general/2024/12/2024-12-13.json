We just realized this morning, and our clients received the \"Your subscription has been canceled\" email notice. They were all on recurring monthly automated payments, hence the confusion. I already have a support ticket in (no response) but I wanted to know if this is an isolated incident or if other businesses are experiencing this. Thanks!"
