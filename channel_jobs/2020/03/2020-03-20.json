    "text": "Hey! This is not a job per se but I haven't really been on the Slack much and I'm noticing a lot more freelance devs than there used to be - <@U25PYL3Q8> <@UF6MG8UH1> <@UMXHBH6TC>\n\nI'd love to get to know more HubSpot freelancers and maybe send work to when I have overflow, larger projects, something I don't work with or am OOO. Maybe even create a freelance directory I can refer people to? (My website does get an alright amount of traffic, humble brag...). What do people think?\n\nAlso, I don't know about the rest of you, but as a freelancer I'm almost always social distancing so maybe we can connect just to chit chat :smile:",

I ended up not putting time into my website at the moment because of my time at the two agencies I’ve worked at I’ve managed to get a great referral network for new HubSpot work. I’d be super interested in talking and helping the community grow from a freelance perspective. "
