Also copy/paste posting this question in <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Tickets-Conversations/bd-p/service_conversations_tickets>\nThis slack isn't an official support channel for HubSpot (more of a community relationship and collab thing, although questions do get asked/anwered so it's always worth a shot) . Most of the conversation in here is around coding custom stuff using the CMS and APIs. Not sure how familiar folks are with Service tools in here.\n\nBecause this is natively built functionality the customer support team should be able to help.\nIf for some reason they can't, the support forum has even more HubSpotters and community members who are specifically using Service Hub tools."
