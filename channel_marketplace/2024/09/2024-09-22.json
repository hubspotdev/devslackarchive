I am not sure if this is the correct channel, but I am experiencing this weird issue with my public app (not listed yet, but very close to launch).\nThe settings page is failing about 60% of the time, and requires you to refresh the page, but it ALWAYS works after 2-4 tries. I've reviewed my route and logs, and the response from my server is the same every time, so I can't figure why it works in the 3rd identical try.\n\nAnyone else experience this with application (Integration) settings page? The same is also happening for all iframe openings from control components on the same page.",
