    "text": "<@U01JT537HG9>\nWe have the same need for an integration we are developing. We aim to add a configuration page allowing the administrator to connect an external platform to HubSpot. Currently, the options available on this page: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/create-an-app-settings-page|HubSpot App Settings Page> are extremely limited and do not allow us to provide a consistent user experience.\n\nWe have also noticed that several other applications, such as those mentioned by <@U079H0S4PNY>, have interfaces customized to their needs. At this point, I suppose they rely on private or non-public APIs. How can we gain access to that type of customization for our app settings? Who should we contact for further details?"
