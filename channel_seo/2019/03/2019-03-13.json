    "text": "So I'm just reading about this for the first time today, but apparently dwell time is NOT an SEO factor? Everything I've read says it is, except for people from Google who say it's not. The farther down this rabbit hole I go, the more I'm seeing prominent SEO thought leaders say one thing, and Google saying the exact opposite (dwell time, click through rate, etc). It's starting to really make me wonder what Google actually factors into SEO. From what I can tell, Google just says \"just make 10x better content and the rest will work itself out\" which seems like a pretty weak answer imo. Any thoughts <@U2H3TT8F2>?"

    "text": "Im with Google on this, I can see how some would think Dwell Time could be a factor but in reality, how long someone spends on a site doesn't equal their satisfaction or not.\n\nFor example, if we go with the assumption a high dwell time means better rank factor in SEO then one can easily see why stackoverflow is always on the top spots when searching for things, however, if you think of some use cases, some might Google a question, find stackoverflow and then scroll to the green check mark, see the solution and bounce. This would be a low dwell time but the fact that they got their answer means its successful as well, so maybe a lower dwell time is better"
