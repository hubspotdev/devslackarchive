    "text": "Hi I'm one of the developers for a site using the free version of HS forms, and it seems that the checkbox field does not comply with accessibility standards as far as allowing a user with mobile disabilities (that is unable to use a mouse) navigate to the checkbox with a keyboard and check the box with a keyboard.\n\nIt looks the element that wraps these checkbox inputs is `class=\"hs-dependent-field\"`\n\nPresumably, this is an issue effecting any user of this type of HS form. I wanted to make a request, that when possible, could code be incorporated into the HTML that would include tabindex=\"0\" so that the checkbox is keyboard navigable and able to be checked with a keyboard to comply with accessibility standards.\n\nThanks!!"
