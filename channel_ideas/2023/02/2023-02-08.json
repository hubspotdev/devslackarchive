If anyone here is interested in sections that don't have DnD areas in them, feel free to DM me, we're not too far from needing beta testers!\n\nWe're currently building \"fixed layout\" sections, where you'd have static modules inside the section, but you wouldn't need to have DnD syntax inside the section itself. However, the section would still appear in the add module sidebar for the marketer and could be dragged dropped anywhere regular sections could be dragged and dropped."
