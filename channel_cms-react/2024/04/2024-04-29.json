    "text": "<@U04DLJH3W94> Thanks! I figured out the issue last night. We're using Chakra image components, and something about using a React component doesn't allow HubSpot to generate the `srcset`. I was able to force Chakra to render their React Image component as a native `img` tag, and `srcset` is working now, given that I use width and height on the html attributes. Thanks for your answer! :smile:"
