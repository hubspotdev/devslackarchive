    "text": "Hi HubSpot team,\n\nI”m new to this Slack channel.  My team is building a “*Referral program*” and want to use a Form that includes the Referrers `First Name`, `Last Name`, and `Email` before the Referral form.  This is one form but there are 2 parts to it.  However, I’ve tried to add the Referrers email as a custom text field (we can’t add an email input field as it’s grayed out) and in this field, we’ve added a *Name* that is unique to this field (`name=\"most_recent_referrer_email_address\"`).  I’ve also created a Form Validation to target this input name and if the field is empty or email format is invalid, it displays an error message (it’s very similar to the actual form email field also on this page but for the Referees email).  I’ve added the `onFormReady` function to the HS embed code but doesn’t seem to work.  I am not sure if it’s the formatting or if I need to add something else.  However, I know the validation works on a form, it just doesn’t seem to work for the Embed code.  Can I get someone to look at my code?  Please DM me so I can send the code.\n\nBtw, I got this channel from my interactions with the HubSpot Customer Support team who wasn’t able to help with the code.  If I need to ask another Channel, please let me know. Thank you",
