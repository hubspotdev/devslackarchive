    "text": "There’s a few things I’ve spotted that could be contributing to the behavior you’re seeing:\n• In your picker module, you’re trying to query the CRM, but you don’t have the “<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/email/create-programmable-emails|Use module for programmable emails>” toggle turned on. To my knowledge, that setting must be enabled for you to query the CRM from an email.\n• In your “DEV” module, you’re trying to reference the `widget_data` page object directly, which can’t be done. Modules can export data to template context, but they don’t passively inherit context from the parent. Any parent context that a module needs to be aware of would need to be passed into a module field via its parameters.\nI’d try fixing both of those issues first, and come back if you’re still seeing problems.\n\nUnrelated to issues you’re currently having, but still helpful: that module attribute whose purpose you’d mentioned not knowing — that’s the module’s ID. You can name them whatever you want (within the same limits as HubL variables). Ditching the default `module_xxxxxxx` nomenclature for human-readable names will likely make your life *much* easier. :)"
