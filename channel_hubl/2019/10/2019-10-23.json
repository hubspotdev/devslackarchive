    "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nThank you for flagging this, it appears that the fix wasn’t fully pushed by our teams yesterday. Went ahead and double checked that it was properly pushed today, and I’m seeing images resized appropriately.\n\nWhen using image resizing (for instance via the `resize_image_url` function) the initial request for the image returns the normal/original image while our resizing service works.\n\nThen within a minute (normally much shorter), all further requests will serve the resized image. Before this fix, this minute maximum wasn't being followed and the original image was still being served due to caching.\n\nMoving forward, attempts to use image resizing params (such as using `resize_image_url`) will work properly. For any previous cases where you are seeing this incorrect behavior, the original/non-resized image should fall out of cache soon and requests will see the resized image."
