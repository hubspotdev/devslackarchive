    "text": "Meta description is meant to be a \"hidden\" element that tells search bots what the content is about.\n\nI've noticed more and more lately that Google doesn't have a 1:1 relationship with meta descriptions and descriptions in SERPs.\n\nGoogle says that they'll use it if they think it's relevant, but basically with how advanced bots are they think they can provide better descriptions...\n\nIt will also changed based on search terms, which goes back to Google saying to focus on content based on search intent and not bots - if you have content on your page that's more relevant to the search intent, it will use that as the description to provide a more relevant result.\n\nSome of this is published in Google help docs, some from research, but primarily discovered through testing for hundreds of websites over the last year when I first noticed a significant shift from meta descriptions"
