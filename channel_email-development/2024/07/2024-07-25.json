But I need to change a couple things for mobile-only view and based on my research there's no way to do so besides custom coding? For the header I have 3 blocks but on mobile I want just one. How do I do that? Thanks!",

    "text": "*Hi HubSpot Community,*\n\nWe're hoping for a little help. We're trying to hide the `lessor_phone` field in an email template with a custom module for email marketing when there is no value, but it's not working. We also tried `deal.lessor_phone is not none`. However, the length of `lessor_phone` always seems to be 21. Additionally, when we used `{{ deal.lessor_phone|pprint }}`, we got `(String: )`.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or corrections to help us resolve this issue? Thanks in advance for the help and support!\n\n*Here is the code we are currently using:*\n```{% if deal.lessor_phone and deal.lessor_phone != \"\" %}\n  <a href=\"tel:{{ deal.lessor_phone }}\">\n    {{ deal.lessor_phone }}\n  </a>\n{% endif %}```",
