The gifty was going to be some great stickers. <https://spin.d.pr/qUX1yU+> (all were going to be circular)\n\n If you’re interested in printing your own sticker I can provide the files. Sorry that it wasn’t here in time for inbound.\n\nAgain visit me at the Developer Science Fair to see and hear about what we’re working on to make the tool even better. We have some things in progress I think you’ll love -- almost as much as the developer menu, dark theme and cache buster."
