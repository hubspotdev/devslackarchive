    "text": "Hello, i would like to build a plugin for uploading images for our Marketing Landing Pages.  Ideally a single button on the Marketing-&gt;Files page that goes to a page on our tool and allows users to upload images.  It could also just be a menu entry somewhere ‘My Image Uploader’ or something like that. The functionality of what we want to do is pretty simple. I am having trouble finding a jumping off point. I have found examples on building CRM cards, CMS tools… is this what I should start with? Even though I want to build it for Marketing-&gt;Files not the actual CMS tool?",
