Earlier the header file was named _header-new.css\nso, while finalising I deleted the default _header.css and renamed the working file to _header.css. While doing this a modal showed that the files cannot be renamed as it already exists. But, I already deleted the older file, but upon refreshing the new working file also was not showing up. I refreshed it many times but the file didnâ€™t show up.\n\nPlease help me recover that css file, because I coded 3-4 days for the header.",
