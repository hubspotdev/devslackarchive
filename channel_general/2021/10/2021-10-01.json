The docs say \"The HubSpot tracking code will automatically record a page view when the code is first loaded\" and I couldn't find any ways to customize the tracking code to either white/blacklist specific pages. To accomplish this do we need to render the tracking code in the specific React component mapping to the route we are trying to track opposed to placing the tracking code in our `index.html`?"
