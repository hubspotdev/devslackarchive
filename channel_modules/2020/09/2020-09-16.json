The browser will only re-load the 1 module’s css file, which may be a few bytes. All 9 other module’s are served from cache. completely eliminating the loading time of those modules.\n\nIf using a combined stylesheet, that same update would force all website styles to be downloaded and processed. Usually the file would be in the kb or mb range. Regardless of the fact the other module code was not updated, all of the code needs to be re-downloaded"
