However, Line Items will not be cloned over given workflows can't govern the line item object. Left with having to develop a poller and applying a function to increase the price of certain line items by X%.\n\nOriginal Deal ID is present in the new renewal deal, therefore can use that as the middle jumping point to join the original deal and from there retrieve the associated line items.\n\nWriting it seems easier than coding the logic if you know what I am saying.",
