The search query is this:\n{% set query = query ~ \"&amp;question__icontains=\"~request.query_dict.ricerca_libera|urlencode  ~ \"&amp;answer__icontains=\"~request.query_dict.ricerca_libera|urlencode %}\nwhere \"request.query_dict.ricerca_libera|urlencode\" is the input field where the user types in the text to be searched for\nFor now I solved it by inserting a third column in the table with both data: question and answer\nThanks"
