    "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm currently working on a usecase wherein I need to associate custom object records with their respective companies. In order to achieve this, I have created a workflow with Custom Code action added in it. I need to execute this workflow on daily basis as new records of custom object are pushed daily.\n\nThere is a field org_id , association is done on the basis of org_id .If org_id of a custom object record matches with a companies org_id then association between the 2 records take place.\n\nCustom code action is responsible for following actions:\n1. Get a list of all companies(around 23k+)\n2. Loop over the custom object records to find matching org_ids\n3. Finally associate all records with matching org_id\nAfter scheduling the workflow to execute daily , I'm facing following issue:\n1. The custom code does not execute fully , it shows \"*error*\" in the logs stating \"*Task timed out after 20.03 seconds*\"\n\nNote: If I test the custom code action on my sandbox account , it works perfectly fine .(It has less data as compared to my production account).\n\n*Any leads on resolving these issues would be very helpful.  Thank you in advance.*",
