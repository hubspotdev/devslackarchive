I have an account creation page form that allows users to create an account with my product (only requires a unique email) I want information from the form to create a contact in HubSpot BUT if i have the Collect data from website forms setting turned ON it puts unique emails (unique accounts) into the same contact (simply adds the new email to existing contact even though the new email is a unique contact/account in my database).\n\nBUT if i turn the Collect data from website forms setting OFF it does not track where the lead came from so i am not able to produce reporting to identify source of leads and conversions.\n\nI want to know if there is a recommended solution to this problem or if there is API documentation that outlines what fields to control tracking lead/contact sourcing that HubSpot uses from Form Submissions."
