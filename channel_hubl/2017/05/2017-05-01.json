Specifically, I was intrigued by these: ending_html=\"\", starting_html=\"\". They're attached to both image and text modules.\n\nI tried putting some comments in there to see where they would populate to, but couldn't get anything to render in the resulting code. Anyone used these before? or are they left over from another system or something?"
