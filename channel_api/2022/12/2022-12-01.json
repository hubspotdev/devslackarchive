    "text": "Hi everyone! I have just joined so please let me know if there is a better place for me to post this or has already been covered elsewhere.\n\nI am currently migrating some of our old HubSpot integrations (using public apps &amp; the now sunset API keys) over to using auth tokens. As we had things previously set up the following would take place:\n1. Direct user to install url\n2. Redirect to redirect uri and check if we already have an installation on said portal by checking if we have a record in our db. \n3. If we do, return an already installed message, if not save a new record for the portal. \nThis was seemingly working previously without generating an initial access token and refresh token, but I have now however added this in.\n\nAs explained above we previously checking wether an account already had the app installed by checking if we had a record for a given portal id in our db. We however obtained the portal id to check against by calling the <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/get-account-details|/integrations/v1/me> endpoint with the api key. This however can no longer be done prior to an account having been fully installed by <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/get-access-and-refresh-tokens|generating the initial tokens> as an access code is needed.\n\nI was wondering if there is a workaround or wether we need to generate the tokens every time someone tries to install the app (even if it has previously been installed) and amend our record of the refresh token if the portal has already been saved?"

But i had a question about a specific field but i cannot find any information on the developer docs about this. How can we set the Marketing contact or Non-marketing contact via API?\n\nFound this article but it is from 2021, not sure if it is still the case\n```It is not possible to modify the Marketing contact status property using HubSpot's API endpoints; however, you can look up the status of a record using the Read Contacts endpoint and hs_marketable_status as the internal value for the Marketing contact status property.```\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/integrations/manage-marketing-contacts-settings-for-your-integrations>\n\nThe attachment contains the field we want to set from the API\n\nPD: I don’t have experience in HubSpot i expected to find something in the docs but no luck so far =&gt; <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts>\n\nI expected to be able to send something like this\n```properties = {\n    \"company\": \"Biglytics\",\n    \"email\": \"<mailto:bcooper@biglytics.net|bcooper@biglytics.net>\",\n    \"firstname\": \"Bryan\",\n    \"lastname\": \"Cooper\",\n    \"phone\": \"<tel:(877)929-0687|(877) 929-0687>\",\n    \"website\": \"<http://biglytics.net|biglytics.net>\",\n    \"marketingcontactstatus\": \"marketing contact\" or \"non-marketing contact\"\n}```",
