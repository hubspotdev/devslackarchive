    "text": "Hi guys, has anyone on here held copy/content against a contact property, then used hubl to populate that content? I'm talking full paragraphs of text in some cases, image urls for src, etc. What have your findings been, too much system strain? Bugs?\n\nIt's very hacky....but I can't think of any other way to dynamically populate content into emails, based off of contact properties. e.g Contact property \"last viewed product\" = \"XYZ\". Show product copy XYZ and Image XYZ. (Smart content and lists are fine, but there is a limit of 20 variants and we have 100s of products.",

An old redirect is cached on your browser - try to clear cache or use a different browser\n2. DNS hasn’t propagated to you but it’s been a few hours so it might work for you now\n3. You’re using <https://qsa-global.com> instead of <http://qsa-global.com> - the redirect IP won’t handle https root redirects.\n4. You are in an office network which has an internal DNS server, and that domain is being resolved by the internal DNS server. You’ll have to contact your network folks to fix this."
