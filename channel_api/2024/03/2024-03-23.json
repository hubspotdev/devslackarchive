    "text": "Hi folks,\n\nI was just wondering if it's possible to set up any kind of notifications for when a HubSpot app webhook fails (returns status code 4xx or 5xx). This seems like a necessary feature so I would be shocked if there's not at least a HubSpot API endpoint related to it, but I've been looking for hours and haven't found even a mention of the topic on the forums, Google, anywhere.\n\nThanks!"
