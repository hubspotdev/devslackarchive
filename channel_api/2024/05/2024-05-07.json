I first implemented a variation of your solution, and then through some experiments discovered that (as long as your phone is already formatted), you can include the `+` char at the beginning of the phone string and then HubSpot will automatically do the conversion for you."

Anyone knows if it’s possible to achieve a sort of *create & update* with any method, just as it can be done via the web app “<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/import-and-export/import-objects|file import>” process?\n(image for reference)\n\nI’m creating contacts that may already exist with same email (in which case it would throw an error), but would be fantastic if I could just update them instead (if any X custom property exists)",

    "text": "<@U070ATQAMJP> as far as I know you would need to do 2 separate calls for that. The way I did it was to first search contacts by email address. If the search does not return any results I create the contact, if the search returns results I update it.\n\nAnother more efficient approach to avoid doing 2 calls each time would be to keep a local copy in a database table with 2 columns - email and HubSpotId. If you find the email in the table it means it is already created and you need to updated it, if you don't find it in your table you create it and then add it in the table for future reference."
