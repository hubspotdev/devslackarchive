    "text": "couple things to unpack.\n\nFirst aside from the image’s resolution are you changing anything about the image in the picture element?\n\nThe picture element should only get used if you’re actually changing the image itself.\n\nSo for example say you have a landscape image but on mobile you want the image to be portrait style. That’s when picture is best.\n\nOtherwise srcset is best.\n\nHubSpot will automatically add a srcset with a bunch of reasonable values as long as you provide the height and width attribute (Which is just plain smart for page loading anyway)"

    "text": "The other part is there is an upper file size limit for the resize function. Secondly, you should make sure to still be optimizing your images prior to uploading.\n\nThe image optimization occurs when the image is loaded with the parameters. If say you upload a gigantic image, and you have those parameters there.\n\nOdds are the processing time to compress the image will take longer than serving the original image. At that point to avoid a broken image the user will be served the original image. That gets cached at the CDN level and may take a little while before the resized version replaces it."
