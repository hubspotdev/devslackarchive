Ideally, if the title field was blank, it would hide the &lt;h3&gt;. Or if the default form module had a simple checkbox to hide the title field, that would do the trick. Unfortunately, I can't modify the default form module and I don't really want to have a custom form module with just that one variation to hide the title. That would most likely confuse the client."

Feel free to use it for projects you won't be submitting.\n\nThe best way to get around this, however, is to use the same macro file for all of your templates, and just drop it in the head HTML instead (though I do, personally, tolerate the warning when I'm first building out the module).\n\nWe have some more holistic ideas for this kind of inclusion in the pipeline, but those wouldn't be a breaking change for this setup."
