    "text": "hey everyone, hope it's a good day! I was wondering if there was a latest and greatest approach to working with Custom Workflow Actions and versioning, where the app developer may want/need to update existing actions and not break existing versions clients may have configured in their workflows\n\nI presume their actions would remain intact and best practice would be to remain backwards compatible from our side (our app) and then just let them know a new version is out? Or is there a native HS feature that prompts users to update to the latest app and review their workflows or something?\n\nThe most relevant thread I found was from January: <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C2YGWHDKQ/p1704906599409549>"
