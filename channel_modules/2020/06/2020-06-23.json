One idea would be to have a setting in the field that lets devs specify a max size and the author would see an error message if they exceed that limit.",

They allowed downloading full res images of their vehicles to use as wallpapers/print/etc. On the actual page you’d only see the resized version, you’d only get the full version when you clicked a download button.\n\nThat use-case wouldn’t work well if we restricted file sizes arbitrarily."
