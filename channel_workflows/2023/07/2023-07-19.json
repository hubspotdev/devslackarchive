    "text": "Hi everyone! I hope someone can give me a hint here :raised_hands::raised_hands:  I have a workflow with Custom coded actions (3) and delays between them (2 minutes). It works well, except for when there’s a deal on the delay step and another one passing through the previous step. It seems a variable that only lives on the custom coded action  stays populated with the information from the first deal and then it adds the info from the second deal (current deal) on top. The variable is an empty array and i add values using a push method. Why this happens and how do you usually manage it? Thanks a lot!",
