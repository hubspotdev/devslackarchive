    "text": "Hi fellow developers! :wave:\nI am developing an email and it is basically done, but there is one thing that bothers me. I need left and right padding in a HS layout module that has a container with blue background in it, so outer padding should be white (green border in an image for reference). Is it possible to obtain it with drag/drop HS email building? I know that I can add both - left padding for the image and right padding for the text but then, these sections have to be ideally pixel perfect in height. Is there any other method to obtain this? I attach also HubSpot newsletter screenshot itself for reference. HS layout module allow only for top and bottom margins... Custom coding a module would be the only way?",
