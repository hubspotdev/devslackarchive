    "text": "Ok, I haven't used that but have used deal based, which looks like this. My understanding is the workflow will send the email to any contacts associated with the object (in this case, a ticket) by default. However you can assign association labels to contacts, which allows you to only send the email to the contacts that have that label, by choosing it instead of using \"All contacts\". For example, you might have a primary contact and secondary contact associated to an object, but you only want those with the primary contact label to be sent the email.\n\nI am assuming by, \"I would like to send only to a specific ticket property.\", you meant you want to send the email to an email address stored in a ticket property? I don't think that would be possible, but maybe someone else knows otherwise."
