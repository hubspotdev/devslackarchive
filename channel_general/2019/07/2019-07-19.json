I don't know if this is an issue that should be surfaced to product folks, but for the sake of the practicum: I would rely on a standard browser preview and dragging the window to resize. The gif I have on the practicum requirements page shows resizing a screen that way. I don't want to be pushy about how folks do dev work, but I'm usually not a huge fan of those media preview features since the goal of responsiveness isn't specific device sizes but everything in between. If that makes sense."
