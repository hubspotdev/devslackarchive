    "text": "Hi all, I'm wondering what the best workflow would be to create a page template that contains:\n1. Multiple sections with rows and columns\n2. Some styles on the sections and columns, like (image) backgrounds and paddings/margins, \n3. Multiple (custom) modules with specific settings and dummy content\nIs it only possible to code this directly in the HTML + hubble file?\n\nIn my mind it would be super conveniÃ«nt to create the page in the page builder and be able to export a code block to a page template file. Is this possible?\n\nAnd related to this, is it possible to save a section and then convert it to a reusable section for a theme?",
