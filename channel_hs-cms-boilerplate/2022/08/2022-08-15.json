    "text": "Hey all :wave:\n\nNew minor release of boilerplate (v3.5: <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/releases/tag/v3.5.0>)! There are a few minor feature enhancements and a minor bug fix with the textarea form field. The bigger change in the release is updating the layout from using float to flex. We will add items to v3.6 project board (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/projects/18>) once we begin planning for that next release but please let us know if there are things you'd like to see in boilerplate that aren't already reflected in the open issues in the time being (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-requests>)!",
