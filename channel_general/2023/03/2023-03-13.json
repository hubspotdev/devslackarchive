(taken from CNN)\n\nAs far as I can tell, current editing abilities for the pop-ups are super unsatisfactory. There is very limited level of control and editing. It seems I can't change the positioning of any of the elements of the poop-up, and we are always stuck with the bland, light grey background color no matter what\n\nFurthermore, if it is possible to customize HubSpot forms such as the attached CNN example, can someone please tell me *specifically* the steps needed to achieve this?\n\nI am on our marketing team, so it is important for me to scope out that - if it is possible - if our team currently has the skills needed to acheive this, or if an external developer is needed.
