I talked to HubSpot support and was told...\n\n_it appears, this needs to be added from the platform's end, as our installation process will start with the oAuth request, and then the platform should add the parameter and allow the user to continue with the process, it appears Wordpress is not adding the parameter and thus does not validate the app._\n\nHas anyone come across this error before, and if so, any guidance on how to resolve it? It seems to be an oAuth error, but I don't know why my site wouldn't be doing what it's supposed to in that regard.\n\nThanks in advance. Hope everyone is off to a great new year!"
