    "text": "Without looking too deep into it: You have the same css selectors for both modules, so the one that comes later in the view will define which css gets applied. So if you would swap the order you would see a different situation.\n\nbest solution would be to give one of the two modules a variant class name instead of using the same classes in both. This would have to happen in the module.html and the module.css files to work as intended.\n\nBut Rushik seems to already have found a quick fix to solve it - just for the future you should make sure your css works ONLY for the modules you intend to."
