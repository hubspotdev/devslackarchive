I am not able to reduce it here because there is most of the js loaded into cms and app connectivity. I do not know about the Expiration Date of the Scripts maybe it is set in code then I need to check it. <https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketing.sfgate.com%2F&amp;tab=desktop|This is page>\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to improve optimization following the recommendations of PageSpeed ​​if possible?",

Bundling those assets together, or putting them in an embedded &lt;style&gt; or &lt;script&gt; tag at the HTML level will lead to less requests and less blocking time."

If you really wanted to keep them all tied together in a single blog you could grab the tag and based off that that tag conditionally render markup. But I wouldnt recommend this approach. There are too many places where it could go wrong and it’s not so future proof.\n\nIf at all possible, I would recommend splitting the blogs up into their own blog. A blog for “Blogs”, one for “Case Studies”, one for Webinars, etc. Then its much easier to just build separate templates for them and then you can use the tags to dig a bit deeper in terms of filtering or other categorization.\n\nOnce youve made new Blogs moving them from, say “Blog” to “Case Studies” is as easy as going into the blog post settings tab and picking the correct blog domain from the url dropdown."
