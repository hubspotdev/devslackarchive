    "text": "Hey guys, *Can you throttle emails sent via HubSpot?*\n\nI have a client that has an email list of like 50,000 users. They want to send marketing emails that will go out to all of these people but in a staggered fashion. The reason is because the emails may cause these people to call/contact their representatives, and they don’t have the capacity to handle the crazy waves of calls these emails generate. They can however pull it off if the emails are staggered so say 10,000 get the email now, 10,000 get the email a few hours later, 10,000 tomorrow etc.\n\nProblem - they don’t want to segment the list because the segments would be purely quantity based and not useful otherwise",
