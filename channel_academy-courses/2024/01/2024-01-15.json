During the grading process we will check the revision history. Submissions that do not meet this requirement will not be considered._\n*So, the question is:* what should I do to make sure my practicum project will be accepted? Should it be typed letter by letter? Or is it acceptable to use some HubL code snippets and JSON copied from the Design Manager (that are generated there when we create a module in the Design manager)?\n\nThanks a lot in advance.",

    "text": "the difference between `hs watch` and `hs upload` is that watch uploads from your local to HubSpot account on every save and upload handles that when you run command.\n\nso the whole idea behind those are that reviewer can see your step by step approach and how you build the app progressively rather then doing it all at once and uploading when fully ready.\n\nnow, to use it - you have to simply run the command as you use upload and keep the console /terminal open when you are doing the dev work, it will upload on changes in real time and you can see the changes on your HubSpot url."
