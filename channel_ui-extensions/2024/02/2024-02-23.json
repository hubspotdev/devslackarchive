The coolest part about this stuff is that if you `refreshObjectProperties`, any card using `onCrmPropertiesUpdate` will also get a notification (even cards built by other developers!). Let me know if you see this type of util being useful in other areas :+1:"

    "text": ":balloon: *Bi-directional refresh of CRM properties between custom card & parent page*\n*(*<@U01QVR44MEY> beat me to it, but here's the announcement anyway! *)*\nNow developers can fetch property in custom card, and listen in for updates happening from Aywhere on the record page. They can also update a property using HubSpot's public API on a custom card, and force refresh of those properties everywhere on the page. All of these happens *without a manual page reload*. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/ui-extensions-sdk#fetch-crm-property-data|fetchCrmObjectProperties>, <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/ui-extensions-sdk#listen-for-property-updates|onCrmPropertiesUpdate>, and <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/ui-extensions-sdk#refresh-properties-on-the-crm-record|refreshObjectProperties> together enable bi-directional refresh of CRM properties between custom card & parent page. And this is a baby step towards solving the problem of data freshness between extensions (custom cards) & extension points (record pages). Check out the the sample app that demonstrates all of them working together: <https://github.com/HubSpot/ui-extensions-examples/tree/main/bi-directional-property-refresh>. Changelog announcement will be coming soon.\n\n:information_source: We are taking small steps toward solving the problem of data freshness between extensions and extension points. Keep your feedback and problems coming.",
