    "text": "Question about the new SameSite=Lax requirements that chrome (and soon other browsers) are putting in place. Our understanding is that the HubSpot embed that is placed on sites (not HubSpot CMS sites, but sites that are hosted elsewhere and might be using HubSpot for tracking and forms) are utilizing 3rd party cookies. If the domain isn't explicitly set to allow third party or specifically HubSpot's cookies, will all HubSpot tracking/forms work properly via the javascript itself? Or is that cookie data necessary? I'm curious if there's an documentation on best practices with this new requirement."
