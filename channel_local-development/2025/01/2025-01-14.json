It isn’t related to the issue you noted but if it is oddly an issue with our action it may actually fix it.\n\nunder the hood what was changed was:\n• latest node version is now used.\n• latest version of checkout is now used.\n• pinned CLI version to prevent future breaking changes\n• Changed `portal` to `account` for consistency across all of our tools.\nI haven’t announced this just yet on the developer changelog but will be doing so soon.\n\nIn the meantime you can try upgrading to it now - here are the instructions to update your yml file:\nUpdate all lines that say:\n`uses: actions/checkout@v#`\nTo:\n`uses: actions/checkout@v4`\n(ensure indentation remains the same)\nUpdate all lines that say:\n`uses: HubSpot/HubSpot-cms-deploy-action@v#`\nTo\n`uses: HubSpot/HubSpot-cms-deploy-action@v2`\n(ensure indentation remains the same as it was before)\n\nIn the `with` section of the `uses: HubSpot/HubSpot-cms-deploy-action@v2` Change `portal_id` parameter to `account_id`.\n\nIn our example here, we changed the code so that you could use a GitHub variable for account id instead of the secret - but if you don’t want to go through the trouble of changing your secret to a variable that’s fine, the secret will be used if the variable isn’t provided.\n```uses: HubSpot/HubSpot-cms-deploy-action@v2\n        with:\n          src_dir: <src> ## ex. src\n          dest_dir: <src> ## ex. my-theme\n          account_id: ${{ vars.HubSpot_account_id || secrets.HubSpot_portal_id }}\n          personal_access_key: ${{ secrets.HubSpot_personal_access_key }}```"
