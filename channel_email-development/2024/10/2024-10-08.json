    "text": "Hi group! I am trying to create email sending subdomains to improve deliverability and separate out our regular domain for internal sending, sales cold emailing, marketing emails, and transactional. I'm having a really hard time because Google Domains was purchased by SquareSpace. So I create the subdomain in SquareSpace on our DNS, but in order to create a real email address for it, I then go to Google Workplace to add a user email, then when I get into HubSpot, it give me an error because MX records and such are already configured for Google sending, but if they aren't then the email address doesn't exist.\n\nI'm so lost on what I might be doing incorrectly.",
