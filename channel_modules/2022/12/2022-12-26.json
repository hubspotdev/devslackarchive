    "text": "Happy Holidays!\nI'm fairly new to HubSpot development and I'm working on the HubSpot Developer Course and having trouble with the \"make a team member module with a behavior of going from 3 columns to 2 when the screen width is less than 900 px\". I can technically achieve the desired behavior by removing some of the built in styling from the 'row-fluid' class but I just failed the assignment and I'm sure there's a better way that's not so hacky. I've searched the docs but have not found much on modifying the built in rows and columns or proper configuration.\nCan anyone help point me in the direction of understanding the concepts behind what makes this work and what the correct way to achieve this type of behavior involves?",
