    "text": "Hi, I've been searching everywhere with no luck. Does anyone have any links to documentation that explains how to create localised CRM cards for a public app? The marketplace listings form allows you to specify which languages the app is available in, but I can't see a way to actually set up for multiple languages. Is this something supported in UI extensions?\nAny help greatly appreciated here."
