However when I look for it in the design manager I don’t see the new HubSpot module. Is there something I’m missing <@U26AKMZ19>?",

    "text": "Yessir — I would say this is a good rule of thumb to follow now, if you don’t see the module being reflected in the `@HubSpot` dir — check link above and see if the module is in there. Chances are more and more assets will be built as react modules going forward. Won’t always be the case. But will be more frequent for sure.\n\nThe repo above is synced with our internal repo that serves all of the assets. So developers will still be able to see the code for default modules. Bundling it with all of the react resources was an attempt to make it easy to get started and have the HS react world at your fingertips quite quickly."
