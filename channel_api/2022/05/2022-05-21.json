    "text": "Hey all,\n\nWe're utilizing Ecomm Sync and tried to upload different deals to different pipelines but failed. Is `/ecomm/v2/sync` API explicitly reserved for a single pipeline? I haven't got a clear answer from the docs, but this error message is suspicious\n\n```INVALID_DEAL_STAGE - a deal update includes a deal stage that is not part of the eCommerce pipeline```\nCan anyone suggest whether it is the case and the `ecomm/v2/sync` is explicitly limited to the single ecomm pipeline?"
