    "text": "<@U7SL518D6> from what I remember having talked with <@U22PNRAJD> sometime last year it sounded like that's a long term vision of where the marketplace is going from a capability perspective. I've had a lot of the same questions around how updating modules works when we have updates to make too. I don't know that customers know where to even go to check for those types of things, let alone what would happen if they did.\n\nI even wonder from the standpoint of say you find a bug in the stylesheet that doesn't require an update to a module or template to fix. Can we update it in our portal, resubmit to the marketplace (somehow?) and then it gets pushed to everyone who has it? It'd allow providers to be proactive with notifying customers about issues or improvements instead of handling support requests (or customers reaching out to HS support which I know happens a lot) or leaving customers with a poor experience."
