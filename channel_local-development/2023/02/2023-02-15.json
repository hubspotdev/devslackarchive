So we are struggling to push those modules file since the table row in sandbox server doesn’t exist. Do you have any workaround on this ?"

Then you don’t have an issue with it not finding the specific row.\nSet up the module afterwards with the right row in your sandbox portal, for testing.\nThis way you have the possibility to test the module in the sandbox portal, and you don’t get an error because you don’t have a default row id (which doesn’t exist) attached to the module."
