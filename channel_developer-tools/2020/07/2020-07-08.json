I’ll just ask for a bit of patience on that one.\n• re: fields we do have the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/properties|properties API> to tell you about what properties have been created for any CRM object. Otherwise you will need to refer to the documentation\n• re: Postman - we do have downloadable Postman collections for each API.

Or you could include it on the template layout for theme but that could easily get a little overwhelming. Likely best to keep it in the settings area so it is included with {{standard_header_includes }}\n\nThe only way that I can think of to make it work with themes is to make a boolean that hides the google font picker and then some custom inputs for a choice select that contains the adobe fonts you are importing.\n\nAdobe fonts are not baked into themes in the same way that the google font stack is. --as far as I am aware"
