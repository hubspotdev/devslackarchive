Can anyone confirm that this should work:\n```window.HubSpotCallsToActions.on('onCallToActionNavigated', ({ id }) => {\n            console.log('onCallToActionNavigated: ' + id);\n            gtag('event', 'HubSpot_cta', {\n                id: id,\n                type: 'click'\n            });\n        });```\nI have a the same event but with `onCallToActionViewed` instead and this works fine - I can see the event being fired in GTM Debug. However, the `onCallToActionNavigated` doesn't seem to ever trigger - I assume this is meant to fire when a user clicks on a CTA?\n\nAm I missing something here?",
