More ratings mean people can find the extension easier. More people finding it means more people improving it, which means more features and faster bug fixes.\n\nNot telling you how to rate -rate honestly, but if you have a significant issue with it post it here, github issues, or support to let us have a wack at fixing the issue or atleast talk to you about it."
