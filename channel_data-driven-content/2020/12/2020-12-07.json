    "text": "I am currently working on this Product pages. \n \nHere's how I integrated the Products on Hubdb.\n1. Created a Hubdb for Products, this have columns such as the Product name, product category, product sub category, and other details.\n2. Created normal pages for product subcategory and attached the hubdb. This way I achieved the \nproduct-category/product-subcategory/product-name URL\n \nThe issue:\nThis approach created each rows a dynamic pages on each normal pages that uses the same HubDB. A major redundancy and issues on SEO part.\n \nI saw the same post but no further answer were made.\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Many-dynamic-pages-getting-creating-out-of-HubDB/m-><https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Many-dynamic-pages-getting-creating-out-of-HubDB/m-p/383457#M19384|...>\n \nHope someone can help me on this.",
