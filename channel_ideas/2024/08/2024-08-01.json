    "text": "*Idea:*\n> Please create a Form Submissions API endpoint where we can log that a Form was submitted (non-HubSpot form). \n*Why:*\nHubSpot's tracking is an easy target for browser settings / browser plugins to block. There are plenty of reasons why you would not want to embed a HubSpot form on a non CMS Hub site. So having the ability to notify HubSpot that a form was submitted after you create / update a Contact record in the CRM would be valuable.\n\n*How does this make life better?*\nWell being able to say \"Yes marketing team, you can use \"Form Submitted\" as a workflow trigger\" now because the submission is always going to be known is much better than having to explain the reasons why they can't use it.",

I set it up the way I want (lifecycle stage, notifications, hidden fields...), and I generate a submission of this form via the API, also indicating the URL of the page on which the form was submitted. The form parameters will be applied to this submission, as if the form were embedded on the site. And marketing can use the workflows just like any other form."
