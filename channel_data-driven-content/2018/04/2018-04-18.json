    "text": "Interesting issue I have come across, if you are injecting rows into a HubDB table via the API (maybe on an hourly schedule like I am), AND you have the table open in the browser at the same time, you run the risk of the values in the browser overwriting what was committed in the API. During development I have regularly had the table open in the browser for 2-3 hours at a time, but seeing my injected API values being overwritten/lost. I think I have tracked it down to the autosave/ajax aspects of the browser based editor. Naturally it doesn't detect API level changes and bring them to the browser, so if you make a change elsewhere in the table, it will overwrite them. Anyway, just anecdotal info :slightly_smiling_face:",
