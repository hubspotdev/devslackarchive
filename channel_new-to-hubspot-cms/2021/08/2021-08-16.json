    "text": "<@U010ZU6TRD0> Ahhh yes hubl is not valid in module.css. A few workarounds.\n\n1. move your css into the html section and use `{% require_css %}` block with a style tag to put your styles into the head dynamically. \n2. In your base page layouts add a style block where you define your theme color variables using css variables. Would look like the following image except instead of hex colors call your hubl theme variable. Then you can simply apply this variable in any css file on your site! I def recommend this option. ",
