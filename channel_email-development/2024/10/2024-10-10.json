    "text": "Hi <@U07MY6QFH6K>\n\nIt sounds like you’ve already taken some steps in the right direction, but here are a few things to double-check:\n\n1. *DNS Configuration*: Ensure that your subdomain is correctly set up in SquareSpace and that the MX records are properly configured to point to Google Workspace.\n2. *Google Workspace*: Make sure you’ve added the subdomain as an alias and created the email addresses you need.\n3. *HubSpot Integration*: After confirming your MX records, try re-adding the email address in HubSpot. Sometimes it helps to give it a little time for the DNS changes to propagate.\nFeel free to ping me if you need to discuss further. I will be happy to help"
