    "text": "Hi all! the \"Use webhooks with HubSpot workflows\" page has been updated, following the rollout of operations hub. <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/workflows/how-do-i-use-webhooks-with-HubSpot-workflows>\nSeems like webhooks will not be there anymore for marketing and sales enterprise, is it true?\nBy opening a new testing portal it's still there, so i don't know what to think about it.\nIf confirmed, this is a major rollback on licensing, i'm pretty confused.\nCan someone help?",
