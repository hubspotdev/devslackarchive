We don't have the operations hub subscription level that allows coding in workflows to increment date values but we need to set 2 things after someone purchases our software through a deal ... (1) License_Start_Date (Date field - will be set to Step Date) and (2) License_End_Date (Date field - needs to be set 365 days from License_Start_Date) ... Does anyone have a creative way to accomplish this without having to upgrade?"
