Right now I am just using hubl tags, but it would be great if the mjml blocks were modules, not just include snippets. if you have a build process for this, please share Something I can't quite wrap my head around how that might work at the moment"

    "text": "<@UEC65BQV8> Anything that has a repeater in it I refactor into a module. I don't have a special workflow outside of copy/pasting the right areas, but it's worked well for me. One serious limitation is that the CSS is decoupled from the module, and there's no way to use {% require_css %} in email modules either, so you may have unused CSS in your head :confused:"
