    "text": "Does the template publish fine before adding the module? If so can you add a different module and publish? If so there is something wrong with the module. Look at the source code of the module to see if there are any errors in HubSpot. If you can add others something is wrong with the template and would check the source code for it. Some other ideas.....I would close out HubSpot, clear your cache and open it back up incognito and try again. I have found that when I'm working on the same page as another person that can cause issues. Second I would try cloning the template and try using that template to see if you have the same issue. If you are still having the same issue I would call HubSpot because at this point you have done about everything you can. HubSpot will probably have to escalate this but they are usually pretty good at finding out the issue."
