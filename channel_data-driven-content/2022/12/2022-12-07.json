HubSpot has provided a substantial amount of <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/crm-custom-objects?__hstc=238590175.20633978c7f702c098a08115d5d63653.1670341642311.1670341642311.1670430018775.2&amp;__hssc=238590175.1.1670430018775&amp;__hsfp=3382678588|developer documentation> to show you how to do this. In short, you are bound by the following rules:\n• You must have an Enterprise subscription to use the CRM Custom Objects API.\n• Any Enterprise account can create, read, and update custom objects.\n• CRM custom objects are account specific.\n• An account can have up to 10 CRM custom objects.\nOnce you’ve defined your custom object, you can create it in your HubSpot account via the contacts, companies, deals, or tickets home page. Enter your custom object’s property values, then click “Create.”\nOnce you’ve created your custom object, you can use it throughout the HubSpot platform. In addition to using it in your content, you can use your custom object to report on records relating to it and enroll custom object records into your workflows."
