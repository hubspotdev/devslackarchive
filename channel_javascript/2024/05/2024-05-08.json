I'm facing an issue with a workflow, which is as follows: I have a field within a custom object that is a PDF, and I need to send it to a parsing API that extracts information from it via POST. Has anyone encountered this situation before? What was the solution?\n\nI tried using the fs.createReadStream module; however, it only accepts a string, not a PDF directly."
