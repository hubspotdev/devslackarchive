But I was not able to associate the ticket to the respective contact.\nWhen I researched the internet got to know that the below snippet would help associating object. But I don't know what should be the associationType.\n\nI'm using node js and @HubSpot/api-client package.\n```HubSpotClient.crm.tickets.associationsApi.create(\n      ticketId,\n      'tickets',\n      userHubSpotId,\n      associationType,\n      undefined,\n      undefined,\n    );\n\nCan anyone help me with this ?```",
