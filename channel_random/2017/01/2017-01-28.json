    "text": "<@U22PQ1GUE> re timing of Developer days, I know it must make it logistically challenging for you to have an event like that near INBOUND, but for us internationals travelling it makes it a whole lot more cost effective and therefore achievable to attend if it an be on either side of INBOUND. Alternatively, if there could be some Dev topics in the pre INBOUND training sessions that would also be awesome."
