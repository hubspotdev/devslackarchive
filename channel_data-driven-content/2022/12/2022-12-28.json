    "text": "I've recently had a couple of clients not wanting certain HubDB dynamic pages to not show up in SEO crawls and sitemap.xml. Think \"unpublish\" or \"private\". My research so far says that if it is a HubDB dynamic page, it will end up in sitemap.xml, and there is no automated way to remove. I was able to add a meta noindex, but they still end up in the sitemap.xml. This seems like a big miss to me.\n\nSo, I am digging into Custom Objects powered dynamic pages. I seem to recall a post I cannot find that said these pages do not end up in the sitemap.xml automatically. Well, ok, that might be cool. But what if I want them in there? I am missing a clear answer in my searches so far.\n\nAnybody here know? Or have a similar situation they have solved?",

However, since it is still in the sitemap.xml SEO crawlers get cranky about it and really is \"incorrect\" cuz the site map is saying look at me, while the page is saying stop looking."
