    "text": "got an interesting challenge from a client today... they want a dynamic map on their site, but they want it to be isolated to only one county (parish). They want it emphasized that they specialize only in that particular county; anyone ever built anything like this? I think if I could even just highlight the particular county on a google map (using a css-filter or something) that might work, but figured I'd ask you guys in case anyone had gotten a request like this in the past.",
