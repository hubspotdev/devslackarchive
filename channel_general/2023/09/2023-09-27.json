    "text": "Hi all,\n\nIm using marketing hub and Im trying to pass UTM on click in Landing Page, from incoming URL parameters to a landing page with HubSpot code on it (the page was built on HubSpot Landing Pages), to outgoing button links.\nWe implemented the code in the head HTML according to your guidance with a slight change:\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n// Function to capture and apply UTM parameters to outgoing links\nfunction applyUTMParameters() {\nconst params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);\n\n// Get the value of the 'source' query parameter\nconst source = params.get('ref');\nconst ad_id = params.get('ad_id');\n\n//var source = '{{ request.query_string.ref }}'; // Get the ref parameter\n//var ad_id = '{{ request.<http://query_string.ad|query_string.ad>_id }}'; // Get the 'ad_id' parameter\n\n// Find and update outgoing button links\nvar buttons = document.querySelectorAll('div.button.secondary a');\n\n// Replace 'button-class' with your actual button class\nbuttons.forEach(function(button) {\nvar href = button.getAttribute('href');\nhref += (href.includes('?') ? '&amp;' : '?') + 'ref=' + source + '&amp;ad_id=' + ad_id;\nbutton.setAttribute('href', href);\n});\n}\n// Call the function when the page loads\nwindow.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', applyUTMParameters);\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nBUT the problem is that it works on a button from type button and NOT on type CTA.\nI need to work with CTA otherwise I dont see clicks on the reporting.\n\nAlso, we attempted to try alone, we figured that is seems a timing issue that hsCtaTracking is overriding the applyUTMParameters function.\n\nI need a solution that both reporting and passing UTM works. can someine pls guide me how to update the code? Did anyone experience this issue before? How do you track UTMs from HubSpot pages?",

It’s a bit of a band-aid for the somewhat scattered meta-architecture of the HS ecosystem. For example, I’ve had clients who never found the Knowledge Base, Community Forums, HS Academy, etc."
