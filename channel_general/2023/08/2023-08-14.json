Here is a list of all of the various <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/variables|Hubl variables> you can access on a page. If it was native to HubSpot it would be on this list.\n\nSounds to me like youre using a custom theme and or custom footer module in order to make the office hours piece work."
