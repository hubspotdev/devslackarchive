If the latter, it could be an antialiasing or other sort of text rendering issue.\n• If you’re using something like SVGGO to compress the SVG, check that you’re not setting your accuracy level too low.\nPersonally, I’d try rasterizing this and serving it as a WebP — the text is going to add enough path complexity to these images that it’ll likely bump the file size and computational load well over that of an equivalent raster."
