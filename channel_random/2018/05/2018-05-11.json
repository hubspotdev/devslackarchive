Create a div that’s pannable  and follows the marker syntax so you can plop markers down, then if the user tries to zoom or pan out of the area you have images for, show a message “this will be easier on Google Maps, lets just go there”\n\nCharge a flat fee, for the api to render this, $1/year/unlimited sites.\n\nHuzzah new business plan"
