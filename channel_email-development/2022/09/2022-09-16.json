    "text": "<@U038PSNTT55> I tried that unsuccessfully as well. The email workflow work for me fine, but i didn't do anything with IDs there. I just used the post_ids (in my case an array of ids) from the CRM contact property as a token in the email and tried to get the posts with `blog_popular_posts()`. But currently it is impossible to get the IDs from the CRM property. The Token in the emails is always a fixed String, even with direct usage of the `contact` object or `token_without_deafaults`. Tried every available filter to edit the string, but none of them worked. Also had high hopes for the `|render` Filter, but that seems neither to do the job as documented. After hours, I gave up! HubSpot is not ready for this yet. Maybe when the BETA for programming emails end, with the first release I will try it again."
