They using POWER theme with a child theme that has child.js an child.css, but no more options to change HTML codes. So they web agency added the button code to the master theme, but I guess an update could overwrite this changes anytime?\n\nWhat would be best practise with child themes to change html code, as in the example to add the cookie settings button in footer.html but get still master theme updates? :slightly_smiling_face:",

In which case the child file doesn't receive any updates.\n\nThe file wouldn't be overwritten if an update is installed.\n\nWith recent changes we made in v26 and v28, please review the documentation before installing the update.\n\nI'm happy to help directly if you want to email me at <mailto:power@maka-agency.com|power@maka-agency.com>"

If I upload a very large image using this module with say a 6000px width, my thought was that this module will resize that image and serve the specified size based on the screen width. However what i'm getting is still the original image of 6000px width rendered...\n\nAm I missing something or can someone explain how this module is supposed to work?\n\nThanks!",
