    "text": "Hi Everybody, hope you can help me with a question. We have integrated our project management tool with HS and so far I have used our HS instance for testing, however, since this is now our production system I need another staging instance. How can I copy over the configuration (mainly our custom properties and workflows) from the production instance to that developer/staging instance (and continue to keep them in sync). I don't want to transfer the data (contacts, deals, ...), but make sure that my CRM objects look the same on the test system.\nThanks for any pointers."
