    "text": "Hi HubSpot Developers! I have an embedded HS form on an external site that has google ads directing traffic to it. The Google ads team is showing conversions to the forms, but the submissions are not always showing in HS. To make things weirder, it only seems to happen when someone comes through from an ad click (organic traffic form submissions are showing up correctly). Has anyone had an issue like this before? Any ideas appreciated!"
