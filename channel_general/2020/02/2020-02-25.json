We are able to control the template, which controls the general output (author photo, etc), but the only way to edit the &lt;head&gt; that I can see is with the property \"Blog listing pages header HTML\". I assume it would let me put hubl in there (I'd hope so at least), but a description is already being applied, so my assumption is that I'd end up with double descriptions.",

    "text": "Thanks RJ. Its was more when you were looking at the blog author detail listing pages, that was using the default blog meta description. It appears if you set the author bio details field, it will override and use that field for the description. Very weird that they don't have their own field in the blog authors, but it is what it is."
