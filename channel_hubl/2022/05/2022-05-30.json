I even tried specifying a certain tag, and it's still getting the same posts. I have more than enough posts that share the same tag but it's still getting posts from a different tag. &gt;_&lt; What am I missing?...",

If a blog post has one of these tags or a similar tag, the post’s relevancy is increased, improving its ranking in the listing.\nSo, I guess it is only a parameter to “sort” the blog posts and not to limit them to the existence of the tags provided.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/creating-a-related-post-listing>"
