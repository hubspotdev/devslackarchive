    "text": "<@U7SL518D6> because of the time constraints. And also custom packages were still at beta if remember correctly, i think you had to apply to use them. I did try them, but it didn't work the first time, then I tried a solution using serverless with lambda and it worked the first time. At some point I might build the same solution on HS serverless. Also the pdfs that I generate, get cached to S3 bucket for a day. This step will require extra time to test and get working with HubSpot"
