    "text": "I am working on building a custom card that needs to access a 3rd party api. I am struggling to find documentation on how to actually store and then access the 3rd party API token in this scenario. I am trying to reference some of the example cards that HubSpot have released and the setup doesn’t make all that much sense to me.\nIt looks like in the “serverless.json” file for the function you include the secret name as shown <https://github.com/HubSpot/ui-extensions-examples/blob/main/with-google-maps/src/app/app.functions/serverless.json|here>.\nThen in the actual function, the key is being referenced by `process.env`  as seen in line 92 <https://github.com/HubSpot/ui-extensions-examples/blob/main/with-google-maps/src/app/app.functions/maps.js|here>.\nIt seems like I need to store the actual value in an env file maybe? Anyone that could provide some clarity on the way to physically do this would be greatly appreciated.",
