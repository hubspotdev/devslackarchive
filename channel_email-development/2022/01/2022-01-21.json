Outlook uses Word as its rendering engine, so that is my guess why you see those resizing handles.\n\nYou're also better off not doing a blank/empty href in a link, as that causes issues with Office 365 and <http://Outlook.com|Outlook.com> (see: <https://github.com/hteumeuleu/email-bugs/issues/10>). You should always use a URL in a link."
