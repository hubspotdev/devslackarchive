I follow the recommandations of the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/local-development-cli#hsignore|documentation> but when I upload my theme on a test account every files or folders that should be ignored are uploaded... Does anyone has experienced the same problem with the .hsignore?\nThank you!",

You’ll really want the newer features present there, and the renovation necessary to get the new version up-and-running may just wind up solving your issues as a side benefit!"

    "text": "Hmm, not totally clear on what you’re describing here. If you’re placing that `{{ require_css }}` for your styles.css file in your base template, that’s totally correct. If you’re doing so in each individual module file, you definitely don’t want to and shouldn’t need to do that. Including it once in the global theme head is enough. HubSpot’s optimization systems *should* stop you from including your main CSS file dozens of times, but it’s probably not wise to count on it.\n\nYou also wouldn’t want to use any of the `@tailwind` import directives in your module.css files, either — that’s going to duplicate your entire Tailwind output for every single module.\n\nAs a clarification, how are you testing your modules to see if Tailwind is aware of them? Are you checking whether Tailwind is generating the classes, even if they’re not being reflected on the page? Are you using the Design Tools Live Previewer, by chance?"

Saves you those moments of heartbreak where you realize your component only works in an isolated sandbox. ;~)"
