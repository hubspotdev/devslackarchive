If you want to use a cta for that, then go for it, however having a page with multiple actions for a user… like, whats the point of the page? To CTA them to 12 different offers? Its not how it is designed and it isn’t how marketers should be setting up pages.\n\nThat being said, adding a button module and having color options / style options embedded into the modules will help alleviate this.\n\nTo me there is no reason why you are going to have 10 ctas on a page. What are you going to report on? What are you measuring?"
