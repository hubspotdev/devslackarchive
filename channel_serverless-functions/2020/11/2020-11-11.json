    "text": "Hi, I’m testing serverless functions.\nI’ve created a new function, just testing with <http://reqres.in|reqres.in>, based on `hs create webpack-serverless` . I want to utilise `fetch`, however I run in to following error, when hitting the endpoint: `fetch is not a function`.\n`node-fetch` is included and required in the project, and is also included in the bundled file, so I’m a bit unsure where the issue is happening. Looking at how `moment` is included in  `helloWorld.js` , I have set things up exactly the same. :man-shrugging:\n\nHave any of you had any luck using `fetch`  in a serverless function?\n\nMy function, really basic:\n```const fetch = require('node-fetch');\n\nexports.main = (sendResponse) =&gt; {\n\n\tasync function callReqRes() {\n\t\tconst getData = await (await fetch('<https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2')).json()>;\n\t\treturn getData;\n\t}\n\n\tasync function go() {\n\t\tconst data = await callReqRes();\n\n\t\tsendResponse({\n\t\t\tstatusCode: 200,\n\t\t\tbody: data\n\t\t})\n\t}\n\n\tgo()\n};```",
