    "text": "Hiya,\n\nI have a project where I would like to create PDF financial sales statements to send to the contact list of our HubSpot account, the business wants to use HubSpot now as the source of truth for this kind of data\n\nThe nuisances are many,\n\n1. I need to collate the sales data out of HubSpot and hopefully import this into HubSpot to assign to a particular client, this will need to include deductions and credits also for a particular time period.\n2. Once imported I should be able to run a report where I can get the consolidate sales dates in one section - sub totals - addendums and totals including tax etc\nThis statement will have to be designed to include our logo, address details etc.\n\nI have looked at commerce recently but there is no push API at the moment, and it seems geared on invoice only.\n\nCan anyone steer me in the right direction to see if HubSpot is the tool for this."
