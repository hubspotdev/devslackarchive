We initially configured our domain with the A record provided by HubSpot but recently changed our configuration to use a reverse proxy (cloudfront).  Now that my dns records point at my reverse proxy, the HubSpot console is showing my domain as misconfigured and theres a button to reconfigured in the console.  is this expected behavior?  Will the domain records always show misconfigured in HubSpot when using a reverse proxy?",
