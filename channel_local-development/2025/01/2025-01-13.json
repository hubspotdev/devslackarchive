I’m wondering if maybe you have additional steps in your workflow other than the GH action.*\n\nThe GH Action uses HubSpot’s CLI under the hood. I’m looking at our CLI dependencies and not seeing that. Additionally as a CLI tool it doesn’t really make sense for us to have any dependencies related to fonts since the CLI has no control over that."
