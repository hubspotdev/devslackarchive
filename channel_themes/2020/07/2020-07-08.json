    "text": "Hi All,\nCan anyone help tell me how to access the HTML of Landing Page template?\n\nI'm using a free theme called Starter kit from Inbound pixels. I want to change the order of image and description in the mobile screen. I added the code in the theme editor and defined the classes. But not getting the desired output because, when i apply a styling to the container, (for eg: display: flex;) the child element i see in the visual editor are not its direct child element. There is row-fluid from and many other classes and div that is not visible in the visual editor can be seen when i inspect the page. To solve this issue i think i need to access the HTML and add classes and style them accordingly.\nHow can I solve this.\n\nThanks in advance"
