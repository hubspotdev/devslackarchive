    "text": "\"no style fields in general tab\" Proposed solution. Would it be possible to mark existing style fields as \"hidden\" or \"deprecated\" that way we can write conditions to say if old property field value exists display it but if new field property exists overwrite use this instead. The deprecated field will be in the module but hidden in content editors. This way when someone upgrades the theme it will still work but we can address progressive enhancement with new requirements like this. So this error would become a strong recommendation for existing themes, but a requirement for brand new themes."
