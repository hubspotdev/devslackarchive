    "text": "Yes, they’ll still trigger — by design. Page views/generic page events aren’t considered “Personally-Identifying Information,” since they can’t be used to single out or identify a specific person. It’s not really collecting information about an individual, so much as it’s collecting information about the page/site, in the same way monitoring bandwidth or server requests might be. Because of this, the general consensus within the industry is that basic event tracking for opted-out users is still GDPR/CCPA compliant.\n\nIf you’re needing to comply with privacy regulations that are even more strict than the GDPR, I’d be interested to know which regulations they are and where they apply, so that I can make sure to be aware of them in future implementations.\n\nObvious disclaimer, I’m a developer and not a lawyer, so I recommend searching out other materials on compliance before just taking my word for it. However, my understanding is that this interpretation _has_ been tested in courts and held up."
