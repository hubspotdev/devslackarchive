I've checked the `objects/ticket/{ticketId}/associations/conversation` endpoint, it returns a set of items from which I can retrieve their messages using `conversations/threads/{thread}/messages` and it's working fine. But the first endpoint also returns some IDs that when I try to retrieve its messages it says _*Resource thread not found*_, and I see that this is happening for a ticket that shows *2* conversations on the HS page, but the first API endpoint returns *4* items."
