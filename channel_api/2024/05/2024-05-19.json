However, when trying it live/hosted, we see \"You don't have access to calling.\nPlease talk to your account admin.\" when the user tries to open the calling widget on the developer test account. Any ideas what could be causing this?\nThe app is listed under Connected Apps on the developer test account.\n\nUpdate: Dialling via the app appears to work when pressing on a contact and choosing Dial, however when you press on the phone icon in the top toolbar, the message about not having accessing appears. How do I fix that?"
