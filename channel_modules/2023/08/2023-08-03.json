    "text": "I’m getting a _very_ strange bug with field visibility — one of my style fields is creating duplicates of itself every time it hides and unhides. I’ve attached a video of this behavior in action, and I’ll reply to this with a snippet containing the relevant portion of my fields.json.\n\nThe Column Spacing field should only be visible when the Layout field is set to the value Grid. This is working as intended in the default state, as well as the first time the first time the Layout field is set to Grid. However, once it’s changed back to Stack, a “ghost” copy of the Column Spacing field is left behind. This “ghost” copy cannot be interacted with, and remains until the page is reloaded. Each *subsequent switch between the two Layout values adds an additional “ghost”,* eventually causing some very odd and unexpected layouts.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this particular issue before? Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this behavior, or have any ideas as to how to work around it?",
