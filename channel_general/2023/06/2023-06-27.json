We are running multiple Google Ads campaigns, and we've noticed that the conversions reported by Google Ads do not align with the contacts recorded in HubSpot. In many cases, HubSpot doesn't attribute the form submissions from ads to the appropriate channel and instead shows them as direct submissions.\n\nCurrently, we are not manually adding UTMs in Google Ads because we have the auto-tagging option enabled in HubSpot. When we enable specific campaigns, we start receiving form submissions, but HubSpot does not attribute them to Google Ads.\n\nI would appreciate any suggestions or insights on how we can resolve this issue. Thanks"
