    "text": "Has anyone tried to put colors from the theme settings onto a custom Section?\nIt works setting the color initially when choosing the custom section from the UI, but if I go into the theme settings and change the color of that \"light_bg_1\" it will not get applied to the already placed custom section.. Unlike the modules that utilize the setting; they get the new color.\n\nIs it so that when inserting a custom Section onto a page it will 'lock in' those settings until its end of life - even though the color is applied with the \"dynamic approach\" like shown in the image?",
