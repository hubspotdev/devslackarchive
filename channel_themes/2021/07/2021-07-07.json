    "text": "our company has 17 brands. the new themes were great, but a real challenge if you want to share a theme base and modules as we clone landing pages between brands a lot. I created a custom module that loads header, footer and brand style based on the page domain setting.  `{% if content.domain == '<http://yourdomain.com|yourdomain.com>' %} ... {% else %} default {% endif %}` I created a macro for the html markup and css so I just have to pass in variables  like primary and secondary colors in the if statement. DND section backgrounds are still an issue as those have to be set in the page editor."
