At <https://www.blockrenovation.com/|Block Renovation> we are aiming to transform the $450 billion renovation industry in US. Recently we've closed round C, next year we'll focus on national expansion and rapid growth in US.  I'm looking for an experienced engineer who understands how marketing and sales work to help us design data backed experiments and build web solutions that support conversion. It is the first GE role in the team and I would like to work with someone who would also help me grow the team of Growth Engineers and build a solid bridge between marketing and engineering teams.\nIf you have any questions I'm more than happy to answer :slightly_smiling_face:\nBest Kris"
