    "text": "<@UF6M5BW4C> echoing what Luke said I think the majority of HS devs work for agencies or for the end using clients themselves.\n\nThat said I’ve seen some freelancers on the platform.\n\nI think if you broaden your search by allowing the person to work remote, with communication by video chat, chat and email, you’re likely to find a lot more developers reaching out.\n\nIf you still can’t find someone, my company is a HS development company, we work primarily with marketing agencies working with their development teams or working as their development team acting more like we’re a department within your company than outsourced help. Most of our clients allow us to work directly with their clients, we’ll even sit in on meetings with clients if needed, fielding any technical questions necessary.\nIf interested feel free to reach out."
