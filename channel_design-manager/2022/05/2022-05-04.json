    "text": "I've got a weird one. I have a set of CSS rules in file that are like this:\n```border: calc(var(--arrow-size) / 1.8) solid transparent;\nborder-top: var(--arrow-size) solid var(--tooltip-background, black);\nborder-bottom: none;```\nHowever, when I inspect them on the page, they've been rearranged into this:\n```border-top: var(--arrow-size) solid var(--tooltip-background,#000);\nborder-style: solid;\nborder-width: var(--arrow-size) calc(var(--arrow-size)/1.8) calc(var(--arrow-size)/1.8);\nborder-bottom: none```\nWhich is a meaningful change (the second one doesn't set the `border-color` of the left and right borders to transparent, so it inherits the text color). I also haven't really checked, but I think the second is more characters, so it's not even really saving any bytes. The really weird bit is that I have this exact file in multiple themes, and in two of the themes this bit appears as-authored. It's only in one instance of the theme that it's messing with my styles. I've checked the file in the design manager, and it matches my authored CSS - so something in HubSpot's minifier is deciding to change it.",
