    "text": "Hey, in graphql, is there a way to filter hubdb table rows for relations?\nFor example our website displays customer references that have a relation to technologies we provide.\nI did not find a way to filter the customer references to only those using a specific technology. For example something like this:\n```query MyQuery {\n  HUBDB {\n    references_collection(filter: {technologies_collection__technology_ids__contains: \"100504441545\"}) {\n      items {\n        customername\n        technologies_collection__technology_ids\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}```\nI also did not find a way to fetch items as a reverse relation from the other table.\nHelp would be appreciated:raised_hands::skin-tone-2: But looks like we will have to filter manually on the client side",

The weird thing is, if I do `{{ dynamic_page_hubdb_row|tojson }}` I can see the `product_link` column in there, but if I do `{{ dynamic_page_hubdb_row.product_link|tojson }}`, it results in an empty list. Has anyone ever seen anything like this before?",

    "text": "For anyone else this might be affecting, I figured out a workaround:\n• Create a proxy row with `{% set proxy_row = dynamic_page_hubdb_row|tojson|fromjson %}`\n• That'll convert your dynamic page row to a static object. However, the foreign ID column will be missing everything but its ID, so you need to go query the foreign ID table directly. Either use hubdb_table_row, or use hubdb_table_rows and filter down to the matching IDs.\n• In my case, that looked like this:\n```{% set proxy_row = dynamic_page_hubdb_row|tojson|fromjson %}\n{% set product_row_id = proxy_row.product_link[0].id %}\n{% set product = hubdb_table_row(table_id, product_row_id) %}```"
