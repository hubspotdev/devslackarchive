    "text": "Hi all,\n\nWe have a client’s Shopify store linked to their HubSpot portal. All of the products are present in the HubSpot Product Library -- no problem there.\n\nWhat we’re having trouble with is that using the hubl function here: \n```crm_objects('product', 'limit=100')```\nGives us a list of objects containing Price, Name, CreatedAt, and ID properties, but nothing in the way of the product description or anything else. How can I get some of the other fields that represent a Shopify product like the description or product tags? I know they’re in HubSpot _somewhere_ since those fields show up in the Product Library.\n\nCan anyone help with this? Is this documented anywhere? Is this the right place to ask? :joy:"
