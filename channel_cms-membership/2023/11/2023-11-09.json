    "text": "We use CMS memberships for a customer portal so our B2B customers can view orders, pay online invoices, and submit Tickets to our service team. We're trying to build a new feature where we can house inspection data as files and make it viewable only to the associated customer who is logged in. We had initially looked at HubDB tables to support this feature, but it looks like there's risk around the technical limitations of HubDB tables and security since those files could be accessible to the public. Has anyone who's built a similar feature have a solution that works for them? Thanks, developers!",

    "text": "If each customer only has a single inspection file, you could add a custom contact property of the type `file` to house it.\n\nIf there are multiple inspection files per customer, that gets a little tougher â€” you might have to create a custom Inspection Data object an associate them with the customer."
