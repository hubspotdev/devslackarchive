    "text": "<@U05R380MLMC> yeah that's my typical go-to but this only shows up on custom labels. So if I just open up the association and create no custom labels, then this isn't available, as the default association isn't visible in the list.\n\nThe use case here is creating a default association between a standard and a custom object via API. You always need to enter a value for associationTypeId (which is the Association ID) when doing so. The API docs list all the IDs for standard <> standard objects, but obviously can't do that for custom objects. However, since the default association between two objects doesn't show in HubSpot's interface or URL structure, I was just wondering if there's any other way to find it than through the API."

In our logic, we loop through all pages until there are no more pages (i.e. until the paging token is null). However, HubSpot’s search endpoint itself has an upper limit (often around 10,000 records) that it will return for a given query.\nSo when you see `\"after\": \"10000\"`, that indicates that HubSpot has reached its internal maximum for that search query. To retrieve more than 10,000 records, you’d need to change your query parameters (for example, by narrowing your filters so that each query returns fewer records) or use an export tool (such as HubSpot’s data export functionality) that isn’t subject to the same limit.\n\nHas anyone overcome this before?\n\nFYI, I am using V3.10 of the PHP API Library and this is the function call\n\nHubSpot_api()->crm()->objects()->accreditations()->search($body);\n\nI've had a chat with support and they directed me here...",
