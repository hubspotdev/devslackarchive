I see this can be done via the legacy (v1) API.\nI don't want to save on my local database if a contact has been already sent to HubSpot or not... I just want to send my custom properties and attach them to a new contact or update an existing one. Any help?",

Without adding state to local db, the alternative I have used is to attempt a fetch using contact email (or another unique field you have configured) for every update. If you can batch them, you can look up 100 contacts at a time this way. If not, it doubles the amount of calls."

    "text": "TL;DR: I agree with <@U01CFE2DVFT>, even though the documentation says otherwise:\n\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/crm-setup/deduplication-of-contacts-companies-deals-tickets|This page> suggests you should be able to just use `create` , and it will amount to an `update` if a contact with the same email already exists:\n\n&gt; Deduplicate contacts by email address\n&gt; \n&gt; When a new contact is added through import, form submission, or API, HubSpot will look for a matching value in the _Email_ property. If a contact already exists in your account with the same email address, the new contact information will be added to the existing contact record.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, if you import a list of contacts that includes \"<mailto:admin@HubSpot.com|admin@HubSpot.com>\", and an existing contact in your HubSpot account already has the email address \"<mailto:admin@HubSpot.com|admin@HubSpot.com>\", the imported information will be added to that specific contact record.\nHowever, it doesn't work.  You get an error back if the email belongs to an existing contact:\n```{\n  \"status\": \"error\",\n  \"message\": \"Contact already exists. Existing ID: 6501\",\n  \"correlationId\": \"&lt;some GUID&gt;\",\n  \"category\": \"CONFLICT\"\n}```\n...so I assume the documentation is wrong, or refers to an earlier version of the API."
