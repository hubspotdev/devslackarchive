I'm not able to call the `record_id` and then delete the record.\nThis is the code I'm using:\n```import os\nfrom HubSpot import HubSpot\nfrom HubSpot.crm.objects.exceptions import ApiException\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\ndef(event):\n  \n  HubSpot = HubSpot(access_token=os.getenv('delete_employees'))\n  record_id = event.get('inputFields').get('hs_object_id')\n  object_type = 'employees'\n  \n  try:\n    api_response = HubSpot.client.crm.objects.basic_api.archive(event.object_type=object_type, event.object_id=record_id)\n\tpprint(api_response)\n  except ApiException as e:\n    print(\"Exception when calling basic_api-&gt;archive: %s\\n\" % e)```\nPlease ignore the print, I'll remove it later. I can't seem to call the function, but running this in postman and my IDE works perfectly fine.\nPlease halp!",
