    "text": "Hi everyone, I'm new here so I am not certain that it's the proper canal to ask this...\n\nI am using a HubSpot form embedded in a website, and I use the form() function to pass a variable to a masked field of the form.\nThe form is a multi-select dropdown field, and I want the form to ADD the option to the contact's property, and not replace the value.\n\nBut it seems that when a contact submits the form, it replaces the previous values and leaves only the new answer in the selected values.\nI could not find any documentation on how to work with the form() function to do this.\n\nI had this (legacy) doc page, but there is nothing on multi-select <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/advanced_form_options>\n\nI also found this HubSpot community topic but I could not make it work. <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/How-to-change-select-option-in-HubSpot-forms-via-a-click-event/m-p/230834>\n\n\nDoes anyone have an idea on how to correct my code to make it work ?\n\nthanks a lot !\n\n```hbspt.forms.create({\nregion: \"xxx\",\n\tportalId: \"xxxxxxxx\",\n\tformId: \"xxxxxxxx\",\nonFormReady: function($form){\n      \t  var hiddenField = $form.find('input[name=\"my_property\"]');\n          hiddenField.val(\"my_variable\").change();\n          var hsEmail = $form.find('input[name=\"email\"]');\n          hsEmail.val(email).change();\n\n   \t}\n)}```",
