A large portion of the developers on this slack are in the western hemisphere so unfortunately it’s basically the opposite time of day from you. (It’s 5:13 AM in my time zone) So you will see a delay in folks responding, but it’s simply that we’re spread out across the world.\n\nAs for what’s wrong with your code. I’d print out your row.url to see if it’s leaving off the https:// or something. then adjust your code based on that."
