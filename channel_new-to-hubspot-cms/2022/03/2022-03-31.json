    "text": "Hey <@U02KH4V10BS>, There are plenty of ways to do this. If you can provide more information about how you’re getting your date, its format, and what kind of conditional you’d like to create, I can provide a more specific example.\n\nHere’s the simplest example. Depending on how you’re getting the dates, you could inline them in the check without having to assign them to variables first.\n\n```{% set target_date = 1641024000 %}\n{% set today = 1648710000 %}\n{{ 'This date has passed :(' if target_date - today &lt; 0 else 'This date is in the future! :)' }}```"
