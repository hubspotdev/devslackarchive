    "text": "Hey guys, I'm trying to use a serverless function on my HubSpot account and I'm getting a few errors when trying to use `await HubSpotClient.cms.hubdb.rows.rowsApi.updateTableRow`  inside my js file. The logs show `Cannot read property 'hubdb' of undefined` so I'm wondering if the HubSpot client for nodejs has anything to do with this. I'm requiring at the beginning of the file, is this package included by default?",
