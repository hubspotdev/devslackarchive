    "text": "Hi Team,\n\nI have one landing page, a landing page about calculating some financial values and generating the report when clicking the form submission.\nWhen clicking the report button on the page, we are shown a HubSpot form popup and get the input values of user information (email, name, etcâ€¦).\n\nWe have configured the auto responder mailer with the download report button. Once the user submitted the form, the mail triggers. The download reports have been saved in the *specific URL*. *Each time different users have done the form submission, the download form will get generated and stored in a specific website link.*\n\nNow I need to send out the report form to unique report to unique users\n\nIssue: How to give the *specific website link as input value in button component in emailer.?*"
