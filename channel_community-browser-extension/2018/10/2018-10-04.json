    "text": "*Announcement:* yesterday while fixing a relatively trivial issue in the extension. I accidentally pushed a bunch of updates/features live to the main version of the extension. These updates have all been tested for atleast a couple of months in the beta, I didn’t intend to release them just yet but hey, they are stable and good quality of life updates no point reverting them.\n\nNon-Beta users - *Changes you can expect once the extension updates for you:*\n• German Language Support - if you sprechen ze deutche, congrats, the extension does too now.\n• several Performance and stability improvements\n• If you have the Tweaks/dev menu toggled on, you will see a change to your Design Manager tab titles making it easier to differentiate your tabs if you’re like me and have 40+ tabs open at a given time. Titles will now display in this fashion “Portal Name |DM-HS” DM standing for Design Manager, HS standing for HubSpot of course. (This is not the emoji update that is in the beta right now and this only applies to the design manager)\n• The Developer Menu has a few more useful links.\n• Some updates to the dark theme.(some readability tweaks, performance tweaks, styling updates for elements that previously were not affected by the dark theme(rich text overlay, add widget interface, swap widget interface, global group borders, tweaks to make code editor and dark theme feel more unified, simple menu interface, add group interface))\n\nPlease post in this chat if you find any bugs or have feedback. I will try to address as quickly as I can. As I said each of these features has been tested over at-least a couple months by those in the beta. We don’t expect any bugs. Thank you for using the extension."
