    "text": "I am looking to integrate HubSpot into the signup process for our Azure AD B2C SSO setup. the idea is that we create a contact for the even used during the signup (unless it already exists) and if the user gives consent, trigger the signup process to one of our mailing lists. So I have a few questions. Here is my rough plan when it comes to the HubSpot API (I will likely have the Azure AD B2C system call a PHP endpoint that will then interact with the HubSpot API):\n\n• I guess I would just attempt to create the contact with the email, if I get an error that a contact with that email already exists, I will run a search to find the contact via the email (or better first run the search? or is there an endpoint that essentially creates the contact if it does not exist but in either way return the contact ID?)\n• Then based on if the consent was given, add the contact to the relevant subscription",
