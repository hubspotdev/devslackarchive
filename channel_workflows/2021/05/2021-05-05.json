    "text": "Hello, I have a question about the specifics of how Chatflows should work across subdomains. I have posted a forum post to the community here:\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Chatbot-same-conversation-across-subdomains/m-p/431503#M42854>\n\nI have not been able to get an authoritative answer on this yet, but according to this documentation. it sounds like it should 'just work' this way. However, we are not seeing that behavior.\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/conversations/chat-widget-is-not-appearing-on-your-pages>\n```7. Unexpected chatflow appears\nIf a visitor started a thread on one of your pages, then navigates to another page where a different chatflow is supposed to appear, the conversation will continue in the original thread. Therefore, the other chatflow will not appear. For example:\n\nChatflow A is supposed to appear on <http://www.coffeeshop.com|www.coffeeshop.com>.\nChatflow B is supposed to appear on <http://blog.coffeeshop.com|blog.coffeeshop.com>.\nA visitor started a chat with Chatflow A, then navigated to <http://blog.coffeeshop.com|blog.coffeeshop.com>.\nChatflow B will not appear and the visitor can continue the thread that they started with Chatflow A.```\n"
