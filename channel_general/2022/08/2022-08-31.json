Today, we’ve noticed that somehow, HubSpot prevented LiveView to intercept POST requests, which caused some errors on our website.\nAs soon as I removed the JavaScript code loading HubSpot, LiveView worked as intended and our website was usable.\n\nAny idea what could have caused such an issue?  Where should I start to understand what’s causing this?",
