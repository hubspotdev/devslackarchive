The listing view does not have a UI for managing flex columns/modules therefore a flex column would be pointless. Blog Posts UI do not support adding/re-arranging modules in a flex column, this is likely an intentional choice to make the blog posts less cumbersome. it also takes away from the point of a blog. A blog is supposed to be a post. If you’re building out a full page that needs every aspect of it to be customizable you’re probably better suited using a page or landing page anyways"
