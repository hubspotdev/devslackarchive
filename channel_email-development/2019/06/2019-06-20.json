According to the KB article:\n&gt;Spam reports: contacts who reported this email as spam to their email provider, or manually dragged the email from their inbox into their junk folder. These contacts will be dropped from future emails.\nHow can HS tell they they marked it as spam or even that they dragged it to their junk folder?"
