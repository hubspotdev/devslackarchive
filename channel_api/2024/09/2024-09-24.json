    "text": "Hey all!\n\nI have a strange issue with webhooks and workflows. I have a couple of workflows with corresponding webhooks setup in our test environment. From a external backend service, I would like to post data to the webhooks in order to update e.g. contacts in HubSpot.\n\nFrom my backend, I get a successful response back and no errors, but the workflow isn’t triggered. If I use the EXACT same body (copy’n’paste from the logs) and send it to the webhook through e.g Postman, the workflow works as expected. Any thoughts? It feels like HubSpot is rejecting my servers to communicate with HubSpot.",
