    "text": "Hey <@U7V9DQ31P>! We are likely going to combine the functionality of `sync` into `upload` to avoid any confusion about functionality (<https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/CLJJXGTC0/p1565125177086600>). `sync` is not bidirectional with the Design Manager.\n\nRight now, nothing is preventing a user form editing files in the Design Manager. You can use the `--overwrite` option when you `fetch` to make sure your local files are up to date with the Design Manager <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tools/local-development-reference#fetch>.\n\nWe are experimenting with ways in which you as a developer could specify the source of truth was not the Design Manager, allowing a GitHub repo or some other location be the source of truth for your files. More to come on this soon"

As of now, I am simply opening up design manager to the page I am working on and starting a preview then using `watch` to update changes as I am coding. Is there a better way or a way that doesn't involve pushing code up to the design manager until its ready :slightly_smiling_face:",
