I am using a Lambda function to authenticate the request which jumbles the order of the query parameters in the original URI. when trying to generate the hash, the parameters need to be in a specific order.\n\nIs there some way to view the URI that goes out with a custom action hook? I can see the intiail card extension request in the monitor section of the the developer portal, but not the actions.\n\nI have used a guess and check method to find the true order of these params, but i am stuck with phone. I have tried it in every position and cannot get the hash to validate with that field added.\n\nthis is the definition of my custom action hook\n\n```{\n    type: 'CONFIRMATION_ACTION_HOOK',\n    confirmationMessage: 'Are you sure you want to create this?',\n    confirmButtonText: 'Yes',\n    cancelButtonText: 'No',\n    httpMethod: 'GET',\n    uri:\n      '<https://example.com/contact/create-user>',\n    label: 'Create user',\n    associatedObjectProperties: [\n      'firstname',\n      'lastname',\n      'phone',\n    ]\n}```\nagain, I have been able to make this work with the `associatedObjectProperties` but the order does not match documentation, and I cannot get it to work with phone specifically (it even works with custom properies)",
