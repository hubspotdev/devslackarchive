If I have to use two separate (duplicate) themes that link to one another to accomplish this, I am okay with that.\nI did just test changing the colors from within the theme editor, but this didn't accomplish anything. My company previously outsourced a marketing and development company to build the site, and they implemented custom code before they hired me on full time. I understand light code, but as previously mentioned couldn't find 'font' in the code."
