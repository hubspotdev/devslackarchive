(like set property to X when 20 contacts enrolled in this workflow etc)",

    "text": "Hi all. I've got a slight issue that I'd need help with. I'm trying to update the name of an existing action but it's not reflecting in the workflow builder.\n\nA bit of context. We're releasing a new updated action which includes some new required fields so I'm not able to update the existing one. Related to this topic here: <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C019VT42R8X/p1702999998382629>\n\nMy flow was supposed to be:\n1. update old action name to now be `{action name} (deprecated)`\n2. create a new action called `{action name}`\nHaving done that, I can now see both actions have the same name and there is no way to differentiate between the two. When doing the PATCH request to update the old action, I get the 200 response and I can see the new name listed in `labels.en.actionName`  JSON response.\n\nI've also tried with different names in case some characters were forbidden, such as `{action name} - deprecated` and `Deprecated {action name}`. Still no visible change.\n\nSo, is this a caching issue that will go away in a couple of minutes or something else? Thanks in advance",

    "text": "okay so i found a way  \"codeless\" even but its not a pretty way, so for anyone who maybe also needs this you can just go with another custom object and then copy and pasting a number which gets reduced from the trigger before to one custom object and then to all the other objects\n\nthe not pretty part is you have to associate all objects with this one custom object which may require custom code and you then have to create an automatic association for every new object which will be created which also may need custom code but both of these codes should be very simple i think?"
