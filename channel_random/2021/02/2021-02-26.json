    "text": "Hi all. I'm trying to create a multi-step form.\nWhat I did was to move the fields I needed, using javascript,  in 2 wrappers that represent my `2 steps` .\nSince then I get this error when trying to submit the form with an unfilled required field.\nIt doesn't say much `Minified exception occurred; use the non-minified dev environment for the full error message and additional helpful warnings` .\nI guess it happens because I moved the fields.\nAnyone who can help me with a solution? Thanks!",
