    "text": "Hi Kyle. That definitely makes sense. Using Drag and Drop Templates, we had a lot of flexibility as a developer, but it required a lot of work to make something flexible for a marketer.  The new system gives the marketer some of the flexibility that was only available to the developer, but at the same time it has tied the developer's hands a little with what is possible.  I'll try to put together a video of some examples that illustrate this.  I would also be interested to see what other developers are doing to create templates using this new system. Perhaps I could learn a technique that would alleviate the issue!  Do you know if there are any templates in the marketplace that use Drag and Drop layouts or other examples that you should share?"

I may not be as helpful on the ‘how to best use D&amp;D areas’ conversation, but we definitely have a few folks who would be. <@U22PWJ41G> <@U6W3H6YN8> any thoughts or resources that Mark could check out?"
