However, if I try to include the `hs_email_sender_x` or `hs_email_to_x` properties (such as `hs_email_sender_firstname`) the API complains that those are read-only and won't create the email. I can only create it when I omit those properties, but then when you look at the ticket in HubSpot there's no sender or recipient details, which isn't really great. Is there any way around this, or am I going to have to rethink this? Am I doing something wrong?",
