    "text": "hi I am having a sales hub pro subscription and trying to do this. We have a meeting scheduler meeting created and embedded on to our company website. So when clicked the link it will redirect to HubSpot meeting scheduler link and once the meeting is submitted will show the thanking message. Instead of this we wanted it redirected to our own website with the thank you landing page. So we inserted the link to the redirected to external url on the advanced settings of the form. But we want the redirection link to pass in the event confirmation info as well so we can display that display on our landing page for the client. So we tried creating a sample link with query selector <https://weareteamrocket.com/thankyou-HubSpot/?event_type_name=EVENT_NAME&amp;invitee_first[â€¦]t_start_time=EVENT_START_TIME&amp;event_end_time=EVENT_END_TIME> but the query fields are not working how can I find the correct fields and get this sorted. And whether this is possible with the current subscription and all that."
