On using the `inlineEmbedSelector` option, the widget closes only on using `widget.remove` . So, I will have to implement `widget.load` and `widget.remove` instead of `widget.open`  and `widget.close` to display and hide the widget. Calling `widget.load` makes network calls for multiple files. Is there a better way to achieve this?\n2. Also, on using the `inlineEmbedSelector` option, the mobile specific widget styles are not applied. Is there a way to load the mobile specific widget which loads by default along with `inlineEmbedSelector` option?\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks!"
