    "text": "Thank you for caring about my situation. I want user perform some actions on my UI extension and after that I want allow the user to go to another page in HubSpot (without force to do this but offering a shortcut). I want also to give him a feedback after he perform actions. So the alert with a link seems a good solution. But with sendAlert I can't set a link, and with a custom alert I can't create an alert outside my extension. Another problem is the behavior of my alert that is not so pretty because I can't use css transition or something that improve the UI."
