    "text": "We fully understand. These sites were built this way prior to HubDB being released.\n\nThe one hitch that we have with HubDB that might cause us to use a blog over it currently is that there's no way to create a custom UI for entering the content.\n\nWhat you guys did with HubDB is a terrific start, the issue though that we have is say we have a lot of data to store, requiring (just throwing out a number) 15+ columns. Right now the editing experience is pretty poor and confusing for the marketing folks.\n\n*For developers the table format is perfect, we just want to be able to make the fields editable in a different interface.*\n\nFor example if you have 15+ columns and you're trying to say enter data on a new product, that's a lot of stuff all in one column. it also separates the data from it's appearance in the site which Marketers really like to be able to see.\n\nWe fully realize using a blog was not the greatest thing we could do but it avoided the need to have outside databases and made the editing experience more seamless for the people managing the site. Basically we used the tools we had, to give editors the best experience we could with what we have."
