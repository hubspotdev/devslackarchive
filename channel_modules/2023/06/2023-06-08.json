    "text": "hi everyone, i'm wondering how I could develop a module who use the catalog in HubSpot ? Or there is a possibilty to add custom css on existing module ?\nIf I develop a template I loose the functionalities to pick up the product from my product database and need to import images, descriptions, price manually. Which is not viable.\nI would need to make the Products module pimped up to be sexy and within brand guideline but my option are very limited without at least a CSS access on the email."
