The flow seems to be “working” as everything is attached, properly. It all shows when you edit the actual quote. But something is still amiss somewhere haha"

All that is documented currently is the minimal options needed to do the basic setup. Then the “get” for a quote has a properties key where you can specify what attributes to show… but they don’t tell you what you can actually grab."
