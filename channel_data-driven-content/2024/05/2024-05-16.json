    "text": "has anyone noticed a change in how quote templates in the past month or two? since there’s no easy way to capture the date of the signature, or include it like you do on other esignature tools, we had a field with just “today’s date” that we kept changing until it was signed. Something changed in April where fields on the quote stopped updating before it was signed (whereas previously it was just after). So now that’s broken. Curious if anyone else has noticed this, or if anyone else has an effective date solution?"
