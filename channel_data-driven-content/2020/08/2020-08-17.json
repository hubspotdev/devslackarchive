For instance I have clicked on a item that send me to the dynamic page, I want to implement a that functionality when clicking on `Next` and `Previous` that it should send you to the respective url.

Would appreciate any advice on how I can replace the arbitrary '321' value here with value of the contact's company_id value? Think i'm missing some quotation marks or maybe another symbol whenever I try anything. Many thanks in advance.\n\n`{% set table = hubdb_table_rows(12345, \"&amp;company_id=\"~321) %}`",
