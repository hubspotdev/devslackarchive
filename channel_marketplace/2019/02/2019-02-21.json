I’m looking to cement a decent workflow for the likes of sass compiling within custom modules alongside a sparse pull from git of modules I have built across various clients into a portal (as opposed to finding where these exist across loads of portals and cloning them).",

    "text": "it has been asked a thousand times (me included).  I know the HubSpot team is working hard to making the local dev environment better.  Currently, my solution is sync local with HubSpot via ftp, do my work in vscode.  I use codekit to map scss files to css in the modules folder.  I use transmit for ftp and have it ignore my scss files.  and  i use github so i have access to my work from anywhere and versioning.  totally hacky, but it is where i am right now"
