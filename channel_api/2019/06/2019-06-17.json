    "text": "Hi all. One of our clients is really desperate to get ALL of their engagements delivered to them so they can share them with a 3rd, industry specific, CRM.\nI used the Engagements API and was able to get that all exported after a lot of fussing. They have thousands of results can be somewhat large. After the full file was  exported, we delivered the full JSON file (~26000 results) to the client and unsurprisingly, they get formatting errors when they try to parse it. I'm not sure why?\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts for a better way to export this data which can only be exported 250 results at a time due to the API limits? Thanks.",
