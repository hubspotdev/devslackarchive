    "text": "Welcome to the JavaScript Building Blocks Private Beta! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chj-_yBN5_c|JavaScript modules and partials> are new building blocks you can use to write React and JavaScript instead of HubL inside the HubSpot CMS.\n\nYou all should have received an email with instructions specific to your portals but here is an outline of the steps to get started.\n\n1. We have proactively activated JS Building Blocks on the portals you requested. Message <@U03U053QC72> to ungate additional portals, if any, that you plan to use for the private beta. We’ll send confirmation for any additional portals that need to be added.\n2. Follow the <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nV9aU8t0ovQZ53mxaqNEQtLU6hFnba9v3er-Vasvqds|Getting Started documentation> to build your first project.\n3. Use this <#C04AY1H2204|cms-react> channel for any suggestions or support.\nWe’re excited to hear your feedback regarding the private beta as we look for ways to improve JS Building Blocks. Please note that while this is in beta, we are likely to change functionality in response to your feedback. So we recommend for you to not yet base any major production functionality on JS building blocks. If you have any questions regarding the private beta, feel free to ask via Slack, email, or a <https://meetings.HubSpot.com/cboamah|meeting>."
