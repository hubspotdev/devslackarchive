    "text": "Reading the WCAG spec is important to do at some point if you’re going to be responsible for implementing/verifying compliance, but I would recommend starting with guided learning to get a foothold.\n\n<https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/#courses|The A11y Project has a great list of courses> and other learning resources that I’d recommend looking through as a starting point! The A11y Project is, in general, a great place to get started with learning about the fundamentals of web accessibility.\n\nIn addition, if you’re targeting compliance with US ADA Compliance, the <https://www.section508.gov/training/|Federal Section 508 website has a series of training courses> on compliance. I know the US DOJ also offers a training/certification course, but I can’t seem to find a good link to it right now."
