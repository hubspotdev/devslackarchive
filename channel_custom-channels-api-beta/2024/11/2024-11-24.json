    "text": "Thank you for getting back to me! Iâ€™m using the simple way; registering the custom channel via the app and connecting the channel accounts to HubSpot Inbox via a POST request the channel-accounts endpoint. The channel account gets created successfully and used to be active by default (still is). However, lately I find a specific channel created inactive and the only way to get it working is by a manual activation/toggle from HubSpot dashboard.\n\nI believe this is specific case scenario for one custom channel (#365003) &amp; channel account identifier (#17841464577436531 - opaque_id}. When I create another channel account for a different custom channel or with a different identifier, it gets created active successfully. I'm trying to understand why this is happening with this specific channel, so to understand what to avoid or how to prevent this from happening to other channels/users. Thank you!  <@U04B32JHTUZ>  :pray::skin-tone-4:"
