    "text": "I was making several modules for a landing page. There was a module which I cloned and made some changes I needed in it to make it look a bit different then the original one. But I din't change the class names of any &lt;div&gt; or &lt;h2&gt; elements.\n\nSo when I put both the modules (original one and it's cloned copy with some changes) together on a drag and drop landing page, the css started overriding.\n\nSo I wanted to ask why is this happening even when both the modules are different entities? Will it override even if I put both modules in different folders and use them on different pages and not on the same page?\n\nNeed a bit of clarification on exactly when the css overrides and when not?\n\nThankyou in advance!"
