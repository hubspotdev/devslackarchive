    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI want to create a public app which adds a CRM card in every deal of the account that installs the app. I have the following questions.\n\n• Can I have any on of  a tab or a card (just like contacts on the left) on every deal?\n• I explored the CRM card builder GUI but I could not find how do I do it for public app. I was able to explore it in private apps. Any resource is appreciated.\n• In CRM card, I have to provide a data source URL. I want this URL to not be publicly available. How do i enable some sort of authentication for this ?\nThanks.",
