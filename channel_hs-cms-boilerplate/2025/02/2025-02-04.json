It doesn't seem to be showing my changes in the editor or preview mode, so it's not a cache issue. Do I have to change the template and reassign it every time? Because I've tried that and that doesn't seem to be working either.",

That is because there would be no real way to preserve this at the page level when a marketer drags in new sections. The dnd markup + the page editor work because the DND markup outputs and expects a certain html structure to exist.\n\nThe section class feature only works in `saved sections` ie — templateized sections included in your theme. <https://arc.net/l/quote/hmtyxmms|More details>"
