    "text": "The “canonical” solution to this is to use Smart Rules to change out the content based on localization settings. However, that assumes you want to retain the same overall structure.\n\nIf you want to serve an entirely different header based on URL path, you can do that by checking the `{{ request.path }}` variable for the relevant string. For example, here’s a snippet that’d check if a URL’s path starts with `/es/`:\n```{% set request_path = request.path|split(\"/\") %}\n\n{% if request_path[0] == \"es\" %}\n    {# Spanish header #}\n{% else %}\n    {# Default header #}\n{% endif %}```\nYou can get even trickier with it and check the HTTP request header for preferred language, but I suggest only using that when totally necessary."
