Setting this up in your header/footer in the module is an easy way to deliver this and still maange it with the HubSpot cms.\n\nAlternatives to this are using a third party service where you pay a monthly fee. Personally I've had some difficulty integrating them. These would likely just be a simple embed code, and you use the third party service to help deliver that content.  There are a few services like this: <https://aimtell.com/> -- google \"web push notifications\" would be a way to find other alternatives."
