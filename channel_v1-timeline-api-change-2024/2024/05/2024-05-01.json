    "text": "Ok, thought so, thanks for confirming. Any chance the team consider enhancing v3 to support updates?\n\nWe have customers that are using the update capabilities. For example, for a sync with Greenhouse ATS Candidates may apply for multiple jobs. Each unique job application is represented as a timeline event against the contact; as the application is updated in the ATS certain attributes are updated in the HS timeline event (e.g. application status/reason rejected and similar). This works really well, particularly when combined with lists. It will be a messier experience for users if we add multiple of these for each job application to the contact timeline as the updates happen.\n\nAdmittedly, in some cases, we could re-engineer to use custom objects however that is not always possible."
