    "text": "We have set up a dynamic listing page using GraphQL to display contacts that meet a certain criteria. One of the custom properties we need to display is an image and this property type is a file.  This works only if the property is updated through a form. When the property is updated through a form the property returns a URL string. When updated by the CRM UI it returns a ID number and we would have to use the file_by_id function to get the url so we would only have 10 contacts with images if we went that route.  How can we only return a URLs for all file properties?  Any information would be appreciated.",
