    "text": "Hi <@U01L6S710JD> not sure what theme you're using, but one reason it could have happened to one child theme and not others is based on when it was created. At one point, creating a child theme copied the fields.json file down to the child. If this happened, updates can get really wonky.\n\nIf you open the marketplace fields.json file and copy the updated code and paste it into the child theme's fields.json file it should resolve most of it.\n\nThe other thing that works is simply republishing the theme settings.\n\nNot sure how this will work since you made so many changes to attempt to resolve, but I would at least check to see if this is the case.\n\nI have some additional steps if you need help from there."
