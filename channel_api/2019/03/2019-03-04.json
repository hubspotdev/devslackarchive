This will allow you to define the meta data of CRM extension inside the app via a UI\n3. This will also give you the information you need to complete the OAuth flow, which you can read more about here: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/oauth2-quickstart> with an example app here: <https://github.com/HubSpot/oauth-quickstart-nodejs>\n4. Go through the oauth flow to install your app into a test portal (which you can spin up from the developer portal)\n5. Create your server to receive the incoming webhook from HubSpot when you load a CRM record\n6. Then inspect it on your server so you can see in practice what the API is sending out\n7. Start to respond to HubSpot and see the results of that. I recommend using the IFRAME_ACTION to start with since it gives you a visual inside of HubSpot to see things\n8. From there you probably have a good understanding of how the API works on the HubSpot side, then you can worry about adapting the information to how the SMS provider is expecting things"
