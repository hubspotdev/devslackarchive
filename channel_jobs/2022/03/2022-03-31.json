    "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nІ’m looking to scale my services and wondering if HubSpot CMS is a good fit.\n\nMy main specialization is custom templates for Shopify and Squarespace. 5+ years experience.\nI checked out HubSpot and really enjoyed the dev process. Especially after Squarespace, lol.\n\nSo, I’m wondering how easy it is to find a project on HubSpot CMS and what is the average hourly rate for developers.\n\nFeel free to DM me.\nThanks."
