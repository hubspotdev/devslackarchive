Can you suggest any work around for this?\nWhat I was thinking that maybe I could somehow manage to get authentication token for member, i.e <https://example.com/_hcms/mem/verify/{authentication-token}>\nAnd then redirect from the signup page or load in some iframe the page for setting password.\nBut I don't see any api to fetch this token, can you guide me that where this token is saved and how to get it?\nOr may be there is some api for updating password of member, (which I couldn't find in documentation)"
