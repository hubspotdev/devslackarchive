I'm new on the community and I looking for any feedback regarding to the use of environment variables inside JS module of HubSpot form\nI'm doing a get request inside the js module, that request require an authentication token which I'm using within the function but the best would be have it in a environment variable outside the code and just make the call to that variable and not have it within function. Is possible do that in HubSpot? any similar idea about that best practice would be appreciate..I really would love not have the variable inside the code.\nthanks in advance\nbest"
