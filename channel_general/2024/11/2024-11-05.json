Most of the time I'm unbothered, but we're having some issues with the use of sass compilers. If Dev A and Dev B are both working on css and its compiled into one common main.css file, they will overwrite each other with every save.\nI've just set up git actions and i suppose that would solve the problem, but it also doesnt, because now my developers will have to push to a branch in order for it to compile and then view. It also wouldnt solve any potential issues working on the same file, though that's more unlikely for us.",
