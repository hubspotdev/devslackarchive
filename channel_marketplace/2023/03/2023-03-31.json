    "text": "Hey HubSpot team-- I applied my app into the marketplace Thursday last week. This morning I logged into my dev account and say there were 17 apps ahead of me. When I checked the browser a few hours later for some reason my application was in draft again and it made me resubmit. Now I am 59th in line. Can someone please help?"
