This is a custom value that is part of a custom object associated with the quote (generated through API).  Ideally I could add a custom quote property but I dont think thats possible. To clarify - Id like the UI user to be able to edit the  rich text content, click personalize and select this custom value. It cannot be coded as part of Deal, Contact, Company or Line Items"
