We use a mix of embedded forms and API forms when an embed cannot be used.",

CAPTCHA keeps harmful bot submissions out of your database, so your team can stay organized and efficient.\n\nIn order for this change to continue collecting form submissions via API, you’ll need to make one of the following two changes to any CAPTCHA-enabled HubSpot form:\n\n1. Remove CAPTCHA validation where you are using the Forms API\n2. Create a new form that doesn’t require CAPTCHA and change any code that uses the Forms API to that new form."
