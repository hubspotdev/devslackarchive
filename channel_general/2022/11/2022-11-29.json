I have a Custom Code workflow to change two letter country codes to the full names and copy it into the Country/Region open text field on the Contact record.  It works most of the time but the other 90% it throws a “Unable to update property” Error.  I can find a pattern or reason as to why.  Has anyone else had this issue? or any ideas on how to fix it?  Happy to share the code/workflow information as necessary.",
