    "text": "Hi HubSpot community,\nI am stuck on a problem the last couple of days.\n\nAs of right now I am developing a template that I intend to use on 5 websites in parallel. Overall the template is the same for all of them. The modules, fonts etc are the same. The only two things that need to change are the colors and the background. The colors, sure not a problem define the template as domain dependent style and voila. Yet for the background it is the pain point.\n\nOverall would like to achieve where the user can only select the background from a set off given options. I tried the following:\n\n1. Using the url field in the fields.json -&gt; dose not work in themes.\n2. Tried to do an IF statement based on a custom field:\n\nIn the .css file for the html {    }\n```{% if background_choice == 'choice1' %}\n      background-image: url({{ get_asset_url('./../images/pol1.png') }});\n{% elif background_choice == 'choice2' %}\n      background-image: url({{ get_asset_url('./../images/pol1.png') }});\n{% endif %}```\nand the fields.json\n```{\n        \"name\" : \"background_choice\",\n        \"label\" : \"Background Choice\",\n        \"required\" : false,\n        \"locked\" : false,\n        \"display\" : \"radio\",\n        \"choices\" : [ [ \"choice1\", \"choice1\" ], [ \"choice2\", \"choice2\" ], [ \"choice3\", \"choice3\" ] ],\n        \"type\" : \"choice\",\n        \"default\" : \"choice1\"\n      }```\nStill no luck\n\n3. Tried to import the asset location form a String custom Field -&gt; same no success\n\nWould any one have an idea or a direction on how to go about this ? As it would be really inefficient to create 5 themes just because of a background especially for further developments.",

    "text": "*Feedback*: I have a handful of clients who like designs with overlaps in their content.\n\nYou can do this with negative margins on a column, for example, but then it becomes impossible to click into that column in the editor as it thinks you're trying to click into the section. Attached is a screenshot as an example, that Column has a top margin of -160px and you can't click into it in the editor (so the client will never be able to remove/edit that margin or any other spacing).\n\nIt would be great if there were still a way for the client to click into that column's settings from the page or from the \"Contents\" tab in the sidebar.\n\nLet me know if there's a better place to post this (perhaps in ideas?).",
