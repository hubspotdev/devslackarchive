    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI need help with the following\n\n*Context:*\nI am creating an application using Auth0 for authentication purposes. During the authentication process, I need to check HubSpot contacts to verify that the email exists as a contact on HubSpot. I must then confirm that the company associated exists and is associated with an 'active' deal. To do this, Auth0 makes an API call to HubSpot and, assuming the email exists on HubSpot, the company/s are verified and must be added to the user metadata within Auth0.\n\n*Issue:*\nWhen querying HubSpot (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts>), the API response data does not match the contact data on the front end. For example, note the highlighted rows for email and company, and note what is reflected on the contacts page when logged into HubSpot:\n\nAs you can see in object 1, the email \"<mailto:xxxxxx@me.com|xxxxxx@me.com>\" has null for the company. When viewing the contact itself, it is clear that there is a company associated.\n\nMoving on to the second and third objects, object 2 \"<mailto:xxxxx@teleforge.co.za|xxxxx@teleforge.co.za>\" has a null company in the response above, but TForge in the screenshot below, and object 3 \"<mailto:xxxxx@gmail.com|xxxxx@gmail.com>\" has \"TForge\" for the company above, but undefined in the screenshot below.\n\nThe majority of the contacts are correct, so I assumed it had something to do with the contacts associated with TForge...\n\nHowever, this is not the case, as I created test companies and associated them with the user \"<mailto:daniel@tforge.co.za|daniel@tforge.co.za>\" which also returns null/undefined for the company in the API call. Yet, it is clear that there are companies associated as per the below screenshots:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI have tried querying HubSpot using several different methods and it all returns the same data. There is a mismatch between what is returned in the response and what clearly appears on the front end.\n\nPlease Advise!",

I'm working on an email automation with our backend API (a webhook).\n\nFor emails that arrive into HubSpot, I'm trying to access the \"In-Reply-To\" email header, so that I can associate the incoming email with the outbound email our system sent. The outbound email was not sent through HubSpot, but does set \"Message-Id\", so the inbound email to HubSpot will have \"In-Reply-To\".\n\nHow can I get access to that header value (or other headers aside from standard sender info)?",
