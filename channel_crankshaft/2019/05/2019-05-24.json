Getting a stable production ready grid and good foundational structure in place is the most important thing for it to be useful for developers.\n\n*Version 1.1 - Components*\n\nWe will focus on adding components like bootstrap and foundation have.\n\n*Version 1.2*\nStill TBD but maybe focusing on performance and SEO related stuff is a good idea\n\nAt each version we’ll try to create a doc explaining how to migrate a site up the versions."

I’m just trying to project manage and keep us moving forward, so I AM making quick executive decisions. Putting everything up for discussion makes things slower, doesn’t mean we can’t do it. Just running on the philosophy getting something done is better than 3 months from now having only discussed getting things done. As well as having something to improve, is usually easier than starting with a blank canvas.\n\nVersion 1.0 is a big deal and will help spur adoption because it will be the first stable release and draw attention to a lot of good practices in HubSpot development."
