    "text": "Hi everyone. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions or best practices for what I'm trying to do. I'm going to be building out dynamic pages using Hubdb with specific information for all US states and Canadian Provinces. I can figure that part out alright, but we also want to put a form on the bottom of each of the pages for a gated content download of a PDF version of the information that is on the page. Ideally the PDF would be emailed to the visitor after the form is submitted.\n\nSince we'll have 60+ different PDF files, what might be the best way to do this without creating 60+ separate email variations that differ just by the file link included. You can't really insert dynamic variables into emails (aside from contact personalization tokens) so not sure how to dynamically change the file by creating just one email. My workaround would be to create a contact property that holds the file URL and sets this URL in a workflow upon form submission, but this seems kind of hacky.\n\nEmail is preferred, but if there's a way to do it on a thank you page instead, that would be okay (same issue though, how might we do it without 60+ different thank you page variations). Are there some suggestions or other ways I haven't thought about?",

Is it possible to have all the URLS be uniform except for the state and insert a contact property in the middle of a URL?\n\nFor example, PDF URLs of: /&lt;STATE&gt;.pdf\nwhere I insert the property to replace &lt;STATE&gt; in the email editor.\n\nAlso saw the other PDF threads :slightly_smiling_face: I have used html2pdf in the past, so will probably give that a try."
