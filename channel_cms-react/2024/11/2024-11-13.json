    "text": "Hello :wave:,\nI am working on a React project where I am using the `&lt;Island /&gt;` component to render an interactive module. I’m trying to trigger a CTA popup when an element inside the component is clicked, but so far, I haven’t been able to get the event to work correctly.\nI’ve attempted to set up an `onClick` on the element meant to open the CTA popup, but it seems that the rendering isolation of `&lt;Island /&gt;` might be impacting this functionality.\nAdditionally, could you provide a general explanation of the CTA context on HubSpot? I’d like to understand better how they operate and whether there are specific technical considerations or limitations to be aware of when attempting to trigger them from within a React component.\nThank you in advance for your help!",
