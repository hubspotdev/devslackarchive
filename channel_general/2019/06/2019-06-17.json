This means that, on these pages, there are two jQuery includes and neither can be removed. Portals using jQuery 1.7 don't seem to have any issues, but for portals using jQuery 1.11 the click functions on the checkbox and the surrounding box are broken. This means that users may be unchecking some of the options but the code never actually unchecks them.\n\nYou should be able to replicate this on a HubSpot site using jQuery 1.11 by going to the subscription preferences page and clicking in the surrounding box three or more times. Checking the box will only work the first time -- after that the checkbox will uncheck but will never check again and in the code the input is actually checked.\n\nI've tested this on a few portals and this seems to be the issue. Can anyone else confirm?",
