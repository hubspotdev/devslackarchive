    "text": "hey there, i'm trying to pull down just one module file created in Design Tools to sync into my local dev environment, but i can't seem to figure out how to get the `hs fetch --overwrite` command to work. it comes back with `[ERROR] Not enough non-option arguments: got 0, need at least 1` and i can't locate any documentation to say what arguments are needed, and running the help command doesn't come up with anything. and when i run `npx fetch --account`, it just pulls the entire file down which leaves me with duplications.\n\nessentially, i'd like to sync my design tools with my local dev environment and i can't figure out how to do that short of deleting my entire local dev environment and fetching from the design tools every time. this seems inefficient. can someone help with this?",
