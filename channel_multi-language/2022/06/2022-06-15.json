    "text": "For those interested — Both HubDB tables use the same slug for the products so I was able to\n• Force the lang picker to be visible\n• use js to modify the other languages’ page paths accordingly. \nIf I had to do this with more languages or pages that had different slugs I would likely use another hubDB table with just Foreign ID columns to link the pages together. That table would act as a control booth for all of the pages in all of the languages. Not the most elegant solution but I think it would be the least messy and easiest for non devs to understand?  You could just print that single row in a hidden div and then use JS to grab the data — modify the lang picker as needed on a per page basis."
