I'm using a private app access token to authorize the request and I have replicated the request in my ruby code and it works just fine there. Not sure why it's not working on the CRM API website.

I believe this feature should be tested with shorter sentences and adjust the spacing for all the different options. Also, probably the pill-shape is not for everyone. I think would be great if you gave the user the power to decide if want a pill, or just rounded corners with a similar UI of button shape selection.\n\nAgain, thanks for answering and hope this feedback helps to improve the product!",

However, the general rule of thumb is that if the platform offers an API, then there should be at least some way to integrate it.\n\nI did a quick google search and I found this PDF explaining the integration process and API for LSAC Unite - <https://www.lsac.org/sites/default/files/legacy/docs/default-source/law-school-support/api-reference-guide.pdf>\n\nAssuming this doc is up to date (it could be out of date!) quick read shows that LSAC Unite:\n• heavily controls their API, so you must get authorization from the organization to even access the data\n• It's meant for Windows operating systems and servers\n• It exports data into file formats and transfers to a file based system.\nTherefore, any integration would need:\n• access to the system + installation of their client on a windows based computer or server\n• A middleware web server that regularly requests the data export and then is the \"destination\" for the file.\n    ◦ That middleware would then parse the CSV or JSON data and send the data via HTTP request to the HubSpot CRM APIs"
