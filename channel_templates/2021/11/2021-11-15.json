So what that means is that if you change the strucutre of the page --&gt; OG: DND_area_1 + DND_area_2 ----- new Page: DND_area_1 + DND_side_bar\n\nOnly the data/modules that were in DND_area_1 will transfer over to the new page. DND_side_bar will effectively inherit the template default modules or will be blank.\n\nSomething to keep in mind when you are building new templates.\n\nDoes that make sense?"
