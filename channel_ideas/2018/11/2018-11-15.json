    "text": "Adding a class to a custom module within the custom module itself would be great. When I use it in the email template its given an ID (e.g. hs_cos_wrapper_module_15422952120814413) but this changes on each use. The ID/labels in the template usage section don't seem to be of any use (I want to remove the inherited line-height on the module wrapper, my image isn't sticking to the top otherwise). EDIT: I just fixed it with vertical-align, but still think this would be useful."
