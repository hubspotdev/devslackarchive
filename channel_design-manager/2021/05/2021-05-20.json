Does anyone know if it is possible to save a web page you have been working on as a HubL template or at least be able to extract a file containing all of the HubL and html that makes up a page you have been building in the page editor? I think it would be a lot easier to start by creating a super bare bones template, add the sections of a template in the actual visual page editor, and then use that as the final template."
