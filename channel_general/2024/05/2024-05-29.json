For that reason we are creating the contact manually from our backend on user subscription.\nAs we still have the pixel on our website is there a way for us to transmit the GCLID to HubSpot via the Pixel without using an HubSpot form ?\nIf not is it possible to do it from our backend when sending the conversion to HubSpot and again without using HubSpot forms ?\nThanks in advance for your answer,"
