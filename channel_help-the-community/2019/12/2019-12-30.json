    "text": "It depends on what exactly you're trying to accomplish. If you're trying to pre-populate a form on a landing page, url toekns can be used (<http://url.com/landing-page?firstname=bob|url.com/landing-page?firstname=bob>). If the link to that landing page is from another HubSpot hosted page, you can also dynamically include the value in the url as well (<http://url.com/landing-page?firstname={{|url.com/landing-page?firstname={{> contact.firstname }}). Not sure if that helps though, could you provide a bit more context around what exactly you're trying to do?"
