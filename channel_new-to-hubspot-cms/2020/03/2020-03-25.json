Unfortunately I get quite a few submissions where people just mash the buttons and don't actually do the work."

I am using the boilerplate. I followed all the steps here: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/tutorials/getting-started>. HOWEVER, when I test out changing the body color to red (as suggested by this guide), the color of the text on the homepage preview does not change to red. I noticed in Chrome development tools that the style of color is being overridden. This behavior is not indicated by the quick start guide. How can I see the changes I am making in the CSS without it being overridden?",
