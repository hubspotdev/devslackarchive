    "text": "I'm putting together a table of references for a site with six different languages. Obviously having all different names for things in the same table as well as some tag-like things, municipalities etc. would bloat it up so I stuffed the translated content into different tables that I am accessing via foreign id's and so far, so good.\n\nNow, some of these references have posts written about them, and some of those posts have language versions. Sadly the URL field doesn't reference HubSpot content so I can't access `content_by_id` through that as it's just a string. I could put links in yet another table, but a `content.translated_content` type of approach would be a lot cleaner.\n\nSo, is there a way to get content id via URL or should I have the content editor type people get the blog post id from the CMS and instruct them to use that for the link field?\n\nE. thought about maybe some API solution to this thing but I'd need to do auth and a service with endpoints and not worth it in this case even if it'd be interesting, here's hoping you could use your CMS content objects in hubdb data at some point :shrug:"
