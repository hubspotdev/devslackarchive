    "text": "I created a web component library to consolidate my frequently-used components, modules, scripts and styles - think buttons, modals, navigation, carousels, parallax, all easily imported into a HubSpot theme. It's built with a HubSpot-first mentality - this means that each web component will be built to accept forms, menus, CTAs, and other generative bits seamlessly. Currently in its infancy, I will be adding a multitude of importable modules from my past experience creating enterprise websites in HubSpot.\n\nBuilt with TypeScript, Lit, Vite.\n<https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kingpoststudio/web-components>",
