    "text": "Hi <@U076XRPM3KP>,\nMaking sure I'm understanding your use case correctly. Your goal is to have a user click on a button that would call a function, and once the processing has happened, you want them to be redirected to an external page in an external window, is that correct?\n\nQuick question: why are you using the CrmActionButton instead of the standard Button? You should be able to open an external link from a Button as well"
