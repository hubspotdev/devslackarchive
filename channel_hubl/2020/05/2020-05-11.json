The \"Master\" page can be associated with a campaign like any other website/landing page, but what if pages created by each rows need to be associated to different campaigns? I guess I could just add columns in my table for utm params but was wondering if anyone has a better solution. Best,"

The method I described above prevents unintended use, because only a select number of things will have results."
