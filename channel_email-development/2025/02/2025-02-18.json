    "text": "*HubSpot Not Assigning Support Emails to Clients*\n\nHello everyone, I have an issue with incoming emails in HubSpot, and maybe someone here can help me, since HubSpot support wasn’t able to provide a solution.\n\n*Our Setup:*\n• We have a WordPress website with Contact Form 7.\n• A support form is available for clients to submit requests.\n• Submitted forms send emails to our support inbox (which is integrated into HubSpot).\n• We use WP Mail SMTP Pro with Brevo to send emails.\n*The Problem:*\n• To avoid spoofing &amp; spam, emails are always sent from our own email (`info@`) instead of the client’s email.\n• Because of this, HubSpot always assigns the emails to our own contact instead of the respective client.\n• We are already using the Reply-To header to include the client's email, but HubSpot does not seem to recognize it for contact assignment.\n*Constraints &amp; Notes:*\n• Switching to a native HubSpot form is not an option, because we need to pass additional user data via email to our support team.\nHas anyone faced a similar issue or found a workaround?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",
