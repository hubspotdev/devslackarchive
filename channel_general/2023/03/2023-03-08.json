I set up the \"Additional Owner\" custom property (using hubspt user delineation) for each group - contacts, company, deals, then updated the field for a bdr who is working the same accounts as a rep about to go on maternity. he has access to log notes and see things, but cant add an activity - any reason why not? I have checked user permissions - i even made him the lead on their 2 person \"team\" and still nothing - log out/log in etc....thanks !"
