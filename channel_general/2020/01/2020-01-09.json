I'd like to achieve a List based on the date of birth field (type date) that shows all Contacts that have Birthday e.g. this month. In Salesforce we had relative date filters that made this possible in HubSpot I miss this possibility. Any Idea how I could solve this? Thanks for your help",

We then allow users to filter the trucks based on custom fields.   As such, all the trucks has to be loaded up front. Because of the 1000 limit, we’ll rework it but I need a way to get at the next “1000”.  My backup plan is to grab 200 at a time via the standard /page/x method but then I’d have to make quite a few of those calls."
