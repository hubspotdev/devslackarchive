With that, only the \"products\" or \"marketing events\" crm objects are available for publicly facing pages on Pro.  With Enterprise, you can leverage custom objects. On either subscription, you can display contact/company/deal/ticket/etc data on a page. All that being said, you can have a Property (whatever is best suited for the business) filled out via form, and then, using the CRM_objects function or CRM objects field in a custom module, leverage the responses as HubL in the same manner of the former to plug that into an embed (with respectively different syntax)"
