    "text": "Hi everyone!\nThere are some general questions.\nI’m developing a new website theme for placing on this marketplace, but I’m worried a bit because there are not so many paid assets there. What is the reason for this?\nI study all the technical and design requirements, but should I worry about something else? Do I need a Paypal merchant account to get payments, and so on?\nI have created many themes for Envato Marketplace, but I’d like to get a new experience here. Hopefully, this is just a new market, and I’d like to grow with it.\nThanks",
