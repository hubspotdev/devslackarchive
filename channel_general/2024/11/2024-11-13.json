I am new here and I need some help for my company's new project.\n\nI'm going to follow the structure of my fellow HubSpot newbie above :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n*Context :* \nWe want to build a website where our customers can login by SSO with their HubSpot IDs.\nThis website will include, among other features related to our company business, the capability for users to check their tickets and chats (retrieved via the HubSpot API).\n\n*Question :*\nIs it feasible to implement SSO for my customers ? I know it is for HubSpot users (eg our employees), but we need it for our customers and I can't find any ressource in the docs.\n\nThanks for reading me, I'm looking forward to your answers :pray:",

It seems to me that since HubSpot is a CRM tool you wont be able to use it as an SSO for your end customers. Only employees can access HubSpot.\nSecondly, to integrate SSO with your website try looking into <https://www.keycloak.org/|Keycloak> or something similar."

I’ve managed to reduce Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) to 0, but I’m struggling to identify what’s causing the problem with LCP and TBT.\n\nFor LCP, the main element is the hero banner, which is fully optimized with srcset image resizing, eager loading for the first element, fetchpriority, etc. If you have any tips or tricks to improve LCP and TBT, please share them. I’d really appreciate it!",

Due to this, we had to rely on a form generated directly from our website’s backend. We're uncertain if HubSpot is capable of integrating with the external APIs required by our CAD configurator to streamline this process. Could HubSpot potentially support API calls or configurations that would allow it to handle this CAD download function more effectively?",
