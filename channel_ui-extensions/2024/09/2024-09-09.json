But if I pass in some invalid values to the query, it will return a 400 error - that part is fine. What's odd is that after I get that error, even sending through a valid query will still kick out the error response. If I reload the page, then sending through the valid query will return results. Do I need to clear some things out after I get an error or what might be happening here?",
