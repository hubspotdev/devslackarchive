I just ran into an issue where someone purchased our module but it wasn't working because their site didn't have jQuery included. I included it via the Google CDN and it fixed the issue but now if they ever do include jQuery via the site settings it will be on the site twice. Any way to prevent these types of issues?",

That way you won't have to set it up and it reduces the risk for having it included twice. <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/cos-general/how-do-i-select-which-version-of-jquery-is-included-across-my-pages>"
