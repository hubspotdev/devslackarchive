Significantly better than trying to figure out the Flex layouts for screens that can have a varying layout shift. Pairing it with the panel component is just killer"

    "text": "We have a team member profile custom object for CMS dynamic pages and cards. Each team member manages their own profile record. I needed a way to have a profile picture upload and preview on the record page. I found a workaround by using an iframe component and HubSpot form with file upload property. The form includes a unique property field that's auto populated via url parameter. A change to the file upload property triggers a workflow with a custom code action to change the file access to public, move it specific folder and copy the public url to another property field. All this was to avoid using a third party for the file. Would prefer this to be a native UI file upload component and remove the dependency on the workflow."
