Can somebody clarify for me whether it's possible to connect UWP apps to HubSpot Marketing?\nWe'd like to collect information about the users of the app and build comprehensive marketing automation interacting with these users based on their activities. To use HubSpot, the code should be installed in the app. So I'm curious if the code can be installed there to use HubSpot for our app. Thanks!"
