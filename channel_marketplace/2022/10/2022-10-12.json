    "text": "Is this allowed on the marketplace?\n\n1. make a decent theme at an insignificant price, $1-$10 (or change the price of an existing one)\n2. increase your sales greatly based on the small price, not necessarily the quality of the product, to go up in the top and gain visibility\n3. set a much higher price now that you have a “successful” product (e.g., $500-$1000)\n\nIMO, that defies the whole purpose of having a premium section and will in time just decrease the quality for customers. But if allowed, at least everybody can do it. Moreover, there is a free section. So, I don't see why would anyone set a price like that, other than increasing the number of installs and list at the top as one of the most popular paid themes. And later profit out of it by changing to a much higher price.\n\nI don't mean to upset anyone. I'm just asking if this is allowed, so we know what to do next.",

So this could be a similar tactic but using a really low price... but this kind of thing happens in Amazon Kindle books. Free book promotions boost books and then become sold. A marketplace is a dynamic place and even more so for digital goods. But another issue is people have different business models. For some, themes are a core revenue driver and others seen as a lead generation tool.\n\nI recommend removing that metric all together as well as the sort filter for popular. You can sort by features and price."
