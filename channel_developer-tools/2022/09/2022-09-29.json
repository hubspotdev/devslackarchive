All of the other platforms we've evaluated (HotJar, Heap, Pendo) have a method of redacting/ignoring/suppressing events on specific elements that will contain private information that we can't have tracked (medical patients' names, for example). In those instances we're either adding a `class` name or a custom `data-` attribute. Is there something similar in HubSpot?"
