    "text": "Hi guys, I've created a small Express server to play with the HubSpot API. I currently have a case where a customer wants to enrich HubSpot data with an external API. Using the HubSpot webhooks and API this would be relatively easy to develop. Where do you guys host your integrations? What are your experiences with the HubSpot API? I'd rather not use an existing solution like Zapier but just build a small server myself. Love to hear from you.",

    "text": "if it’s a small server/ simple app, i usually just deploy my code to heroku <https://id.heroku.com/login>. its suuuuuper simple and easy to set up, and gives you a URL to host your endpoints on. Otherwise, <http://repl.it|repl.it> is a great service where you dont have to actually deploy anything. You write your code and get a live URL out of the box. It’s not perfect though so sometimes there are some weird quirks but overall its solid <https://repl.it/repls>"
