    "text": "Looking for help with setting up HubSpot emails for internal use. We have an RSS email going to one particular team of employee so they are aware of new posts and can use them in the massive newsletter. The problem we have found is the url getting copied and shared has a UTM associated with \"email\". The massive amount of traffic the newsletter generated is appearing as email. Is there anyway to add links to an HS RSS email that do not automatically add the email UTM?"

    "text": "Thanks <@U4RP6AGV9>. I think to use your suggestion I would need to code out a new RSS email template which is a bit above my abilities right now. I may have an alternative solution that is jsut duct tapping the problem. I manually added a 'utm_source=Rep%20Share' to the link, which appears before the 'utm_source=email'. Hoping this gets captured before the email source. From what I can tell the first instance of other UTMs seems to be honored. Hopefully this doesn't get tracked as two visits, or break anything."
