The \"your portal\" error suggests you don't have the right level of Marketing Hub or Content Hub subscription to publish to your specific domain, or potentially your Team has not been given permission to do this by your Account Administration. :slightly_smiling_face:"

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.
