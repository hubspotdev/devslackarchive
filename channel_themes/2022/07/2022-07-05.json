If it’s just assets such as images, css, js, fonts etc it shouldn’t matter being outside the theme folder.\n\nHowever I think you should be able to move it  without worrying too much unless there are already cross references that could break."

I would check the code, test the code flow and then I will move my code to production. This dev theme folder should not affect / touch the theme files which is being utilised by my production site. Can anyone help me on this? Thanks!!"
