It looks like it’s only affecting certain accounts, as we have some customers who are not receiving this error. \n\nWe ended up applying a temporary fix and sending SUCCESS as a returned response from when we initially receive the workflow event. The downside is we are having those affected customers add a time delay after our workflow action to ensure we fully process and downstream actions work correctly. Basically we just don’t block the contact in our action. Not ideal but we needed to add some fix as it was affecting many accounts."
