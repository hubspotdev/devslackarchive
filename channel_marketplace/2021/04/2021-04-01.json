    "text": "Is anyone aware of a \"self-service\" app that allows syncing HubSpot Deals with Netsuite Sales Orders or Opportunities?  Most of the listings I'm finding in the Marketplace appear to either \"self-service\" apps (where you can use a UI to set up field mappings and sync rules) that only support Contacts and Companies, or essentially custom coding services where the third-party partner would have to do a at least some degree of custom coding to build the integration."
