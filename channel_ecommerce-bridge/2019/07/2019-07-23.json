    "text": "Thank you <@UFBNA9K9A> When I get all line items using the API mentioned in <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/line-items/get-all-line-items>, it would have been greatly useful if externalObjectId is returned in the response along with other properties of line items. Is there any way to get it in response? Same thing for deal as well. The use case here is: we have our own unique identifier that we use as the external Object Id to insert deals and line items, and we want to retrieve the corresponding deal/line-item using that external Object Id. Is is not possible to do so?"

    "text": "That’s not possible at this time. Those ecommerce APIs were originally designed to be a part of a one way sync so it wasn’t concerned with getting information out of HubSpot by an external id.  I can definitely see why that would be useful though and will add this use case to our internal idea tracker"
