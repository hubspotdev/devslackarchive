However I tried moving the `designs` folder in several directories (root, `/work`, `/work/hubthemes`) in the local build and targeting it with the `templateBaseDir`, but it's erroring on startup no matter where I put it. It's fine when I target the vast template folder.  The FTP structure seems to be completely different with all the modules in a separate folder outside of `designs`. How would I bring in the modules?"
