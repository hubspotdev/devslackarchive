    "text": "Hey All!\nAs of a few days ago we're getting this error from a GQL query:\n```\"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Can't serialize value (/CRM/product_collection/items[171]/promo_sale) : Expected type 'Boolean' but was 'String'.\",\n      \"locations\": null,\n      \"path\": [\n        \"CRM\",\n        \"product_collection\",\n        \"items\",\n        \"171\",\n        \"promo_sale\"\n      ],\n      \"extensions\": null,\n      \"errorType\": \"DataFetchingException\"\n    }\n  ],```\nThe property is on the product object and is a \"checkbox\" type. So this error is unexpected.\n\nI remember an update that might be related but can't seem to find it lol.\n\nAny ideas?",
