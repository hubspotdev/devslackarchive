Then added  `newResult.querySelector('.hs-search-results__featured').src = featuredImageUrl;` and it works but if the post doesn't have a featured image then it shows the broken image icon. I've tried adding some conditional logic in the js like so:\n\n`\nif( featuredImageUrl !== '' ) {\n              newResult.querySelector('.hs-search-results__featured').src = featuredImageUrl;\n            } else {\n              newResult.querySelector('.hs-search-results__featured').style.display = 'none';\n            }\n`\nbut it's not working. Javascript is not my strong suit and I'm pretty new to HubSpot so not sure how to make this happen. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
