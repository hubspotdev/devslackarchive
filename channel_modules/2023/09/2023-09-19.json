    "text": "So the TL;DR of the original issue is that with regards to module fields the inherit field property was only able to inherit default values. Default being `field B` is set to inherit from `field A`. Field A has a default value of `4`  ergo `field B` has a value of 4 as well. If you change field `field A` to 15 `field B` will remain 4 (the default value).\n\nDue to some platform limitations in the past we werenâ€™t able to make any moves on fixing this. However, we have a fix for it up that we are testing now that appears to be working.\n\nSo the new version `field B` will update to `15` when `field A` is updated, so long as `field B` is in its original state.\n\nThe plan is to roll this out in batches in case there are any issues, likely starting in the next week or so."
