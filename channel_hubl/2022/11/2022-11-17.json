    "text": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI created a HubDB named *Crusher Bucket ( 7-9T )*. Then I created a module named *ttp--product-specs*, where I can select a HubDB. My problem is I can't display the product values in the column. Here's my code: *code.png*\n\nI want to display the values in a column. See *code-output.png*\n\nSo the value for the 1st row (Product Code) gets the value of the 2nd object in the image ( *code-output.png* ). The 2nd row (Suit Excavator Models) gets the value of the 3rd object... and so on.\n\nI really appreciate your help guys.\n\nThanks,\nJohanz",
