First, <@U049DFUK1RB>, that is a perfect recommendation and for everyone viewing this message, please do begin making use of threads going forward if larger conversations are to be had so you do not end up pushing other peoples comments out.\n\nSecond, <@U037S15PHGV> and <@U049CC7SQR1>, in this slack, we have a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/slack/code-of-conduct|code of conduct>, I highly encourage you both to review this as we have the following section:\n&gt; Personal Attacks\n&gt; There will always be times when two parties will have a difference of opinion. While this can be frustrating, this should never turn into a personal attack on someone. Attacking people for their opinions, personal beliefs, ideas, or suggestions is not acceptable. Please be professional and respectful at all times\nI am going to warn you both now to stop your behavior and please move on from this conversation. This community is about building each other up, helping each other out, knowledge sharing, and making both professional and personal connections. As stated in our code of conduct, there will be times when parties have differences of opinion on a wide array of subject matter. Always assume good judgement and if you have a difference of opinion, have a conversation in a professional manner."
