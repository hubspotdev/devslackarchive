    "text": "Hi, @everyone!\n\nI was wondering if there is a way to copy a theme that we’ve developed (currently on the Marketplace) to our testing portal in order to be able to test it the same way as a user would. For example, when we make any changes on the theme, to be able to go to our testing portal and hit the ‘Install update’ button and test that everything is working properly.\n\nI know there is the option to copy the theme folder to another portal, but this is not what we are looking for.\n\nThanks for letting me know."
