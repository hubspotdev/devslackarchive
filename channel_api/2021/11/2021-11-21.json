The scopes defined for the app within HubSpot (i.e. the OAuth install URL) must exactly match the scopes requested in the redirect_uri called from the app itself (e.g. <https://app.HubSpot.com/oauth/[accountID]/authorize?client_id=[clientID]&amp;redirect_uri=https://[app> URL]/HubSpot/callback/&amp;scope=[scopes]) \n \n2. We were requesting user scopes which aren't available with free account tiers (e.g. _accounting_), but testing with a free tier user. \n \n3. To use the _contacts_ scope, users should ideally have superadmin permissions. If not, they require the _Edit property settings_ permission. \n \nMany thanks to <@UFBDBKQ1H> for her help with this!"
