I’m trying to write (what I hope is a simple) if statement on the dynamically generated page, using a column.\n\nIf the value in that column for that row is *x* then show this.

Essentially, toggling out which form is embedded on this page <https://www.deluxemodular.com/careers-hubdb/general-labor> based on a value in the row.\n\nStill new to all this, so I was trying something like\n\n`{% if column.category.id == '7933665908' %}`\n\nbut that’s not the way to go. Any help or examples is greatly appreciated.",
