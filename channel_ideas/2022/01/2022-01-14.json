    "text": "Hi everyone, we are trying to use the new v3 Batch API for creating batches of contacts and other objects. In the old API, if one entry in the batch had an error, the error response would specify the index of the entry that contains the error. This very useful feature seems to no longer be present in the v3 Batch API. \n\nUsing the new Batch API, if an error occurs in one of the entries (for example a property has an invalid value), then the entire batch will fail with no details whatsoever about which entry is invalid. \n\nI attached two screenshots, I did the same request using the v1 and v3 APIs. As you can see from the V1 api, it shows a list of errors as well as the index of the entry containing the error. \n\nIs it possible to make error responses of the v3 Batch API contain this information as well, because currently it is extremely hard if not impossible to handle API errors properly?",
