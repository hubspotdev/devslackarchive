The code snippet code for the team member module used HubL inline_text inside the team member for loop, which rendered in the browser with the same id value for each.\n\nChange this to just use an expression with your team member item variable name.\n\nFor mine, I changed this code snippet code:\n\n&lt;div class=\"name‚Äù&gt;{% inline_text id=\"name_field_{{ item }}\" field=\"name_field\" value=\"{{ item.name_field }}\" %}&lt;/div&gt;\n\nTo this:\n&lt;div class=\"name\"&gt;{{ item.name_field }}&lt;/div&gt;\n\nHope this helped!"
