But we have an issue a user changes their email.\n\nThis is the scenario:\n1. An already existing customer wants to change their email adress in our system, this user have been previously added to HubSpot\n2. Upon inputting their new email adress in our system, we send a single-send API transactional email right away asking the user to verify the email adress. As we don't want to add unverified emails to HubSpot.\n3. HubSpot sees that we send an email to what it thinks is a new account and creates a new contact with the associated email adress. This contact is now a duplicate as it is not associated with the original contact\n\nHow do we solve this? So that the new email is connected with the existing contact?"
