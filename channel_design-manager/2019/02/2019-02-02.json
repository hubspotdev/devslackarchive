Can someone help me out with this? I'm also trying to add hspace and vspace to the source code in rich text module yet it's not working.",

    "text": "bad news for you. The problem is how HubSpot structures their emails.\n\nThe margin (outer spacing) is applied to the TD which cannot actually have a margin.\n\nThe padding does get applied but padding doesn’t display correctly in outlook.\n\nmargins when applied in the  drag n drop email builder only add the `margin` property not `Margin` which outlook doesn’t properly read.\n\nIf you need pixel perfection using a coded template is the way to go. If you just need a quick email the drag n drop is okay"
