    "text": "Hello, I have a question about app certification process - we have our app listed in marketplace, and would like to get it certified by HubSpot.\nAs far as I understand from minimum requirements to get certified - you can not do this if you have tried to apply for certification and failed in last six months. So does this mean, that if you fail to get certified - you have to wait for six months if you want to try again get your app certified?"

As a marketplace creator, I'd LOVE LOVE LOVE the ability to add release notes that are part of the INSTALL UPDATE user flow.  Something like this could be awesome.\n\nSometimes an update requires a bit of instruction. Also, it would be great to clarify whats included in the updates (improvements, patches, bug fixes, etc.).  I get these sorts of questions all the time.",
