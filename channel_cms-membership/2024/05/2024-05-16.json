    "text": "Hi All, I have a query re customer portal support forms.\n\nBasically I would like to check if I can have multiple forms in the same customer portal (cause it seems that only one form can be set up). I know I can have landing pages and redirect from portal to landing pages but my issue is that the client is on pro plan and has SSO enabled on portal and knowledge base. However on the landing pages there is no SSO with the pro plan. Therefore if I just add a link from Customer Portal to Landing Page I will end up having a different user experience and cannot have it behind SSO (only password protected pages are available on pro).",
