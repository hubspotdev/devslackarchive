I was given a project where I need to put a module on webpage and pull a email address from a website url and have it auto populate into a HubSpot form, and then have the form auto submit without the customer pressing submit. Is there a easy way to do this? I'm on a tight deadline and haven't done this before.  Any help would be appreciated. Thank you",
