    "text": "Question - Is it possible to use HubL to get text from a module that is added to the page via the drag and drop? For example, I have a header module and want to essentially echo out the text the user enters there in another area.  Normally,it would be something like `widget_data.a-custom-module.value` can you accomplish this without the custom module? Something like `widget_data.14740526508376562.value` where the number is the id number generated for that module"
