    "text": "Yes, you have understood perfectly, thank you for listening! It would be wonderful to have customization of the actions. At the moment, I am working on the UI extension of a deal and I must say that what comes to mind is what I wrote to you, the list of associated line items is extremely useful, but being able to delete them would be a really fantastic addition. Consider that the client asked for this, and in theory, to do it, I would have to recreate the component from scratch, making calls to the listing of the line items, then on click, I need to delete it and then make a call to the deal and update the amount. <@U05ENUJF7B5>"
