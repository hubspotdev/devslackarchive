    "text": "I opened a ticket related to the API rate-limits and CRM association endpoint (`/crm-associations/v1/associations`) not providing the Rate Limit headers in the response (`X-HubSpot-RateLimit-Daily`, etc.). I just got answered that it will be potentially added next year. How can it be that the API provides an endpoint which is rate limited but it does not provide the necessary data to control the limits? Would not be fairer to just remove the rate limit on the endpoint until it is properly implemented? And yes, I can check the daily usage with the endpoint `/integrations/v1/limit/daily` but that is also rate-limited (which does not make sense at all). Is anyone else facing the same issue?",
