    "text": "Hi Jacob, just a quick note of thanks. I found that the problem area was rooted in cut &amp; pasted inheritance issues. I went back and started with one field and worked from there. Your help was invaluable as I hadn't made the connection between how to include Google fonts and how to introduce theme.json fields to the theme in css - basic, but I struggled to uncover the syntax for some reason. From there, everything else was clear. Thanks again!"
