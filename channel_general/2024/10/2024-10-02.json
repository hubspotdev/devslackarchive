This week, the \"Close\" text appears with strange padding and an unusual border-radius. I've attached screenshots of our chat widget from last week and how it looks now.\nThe HubSpot support team says we can't add or inherit CSS from our template. So now I'm thinking it might be a *HubSpot bug*, but I'm not totally sure.\n\nIs anyone else encountering a similar problem? Any ideas on how to reset it to its default state?\n\nThanks in advance!",
