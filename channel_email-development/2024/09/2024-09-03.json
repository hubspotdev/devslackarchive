    "text": "Hi All,\n\nHope you are doing well. I am trying to pull a standard email template out of HubSpot, and believe I may be using the incorrect method to obtain it. Could someone with more knowledge on the matter please give me some guidance on the correct method to get this data out of HubSpot in a way that retains the information such as getting the written content, where tokenization should happen etc.. My goal is to pull from a template > and then generate a tokenized pdf > and then reupload the pdf back under a contact.\n\nMuch thanks!!!",
