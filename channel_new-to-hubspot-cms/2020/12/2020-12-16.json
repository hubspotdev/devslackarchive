Quite early on we realized that pretty much every component provided by the theme needs to be customized. Many attributes are not modifiable, even simple things like left-alignment of a text. We're now trying to figure out what the next best course of action is. Should we stick with themes or just build our own templates and modules incl. global modules to get by?",
