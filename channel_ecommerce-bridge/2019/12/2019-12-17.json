    "text": "Great question, <@URC2M9CAV>. When you say there’s no login system, do you mean your website doesn’t have a login (or do you mean HubSpot doesn’t have that feature)? I’m assuming you mean your site doesn’t have it, as well as it not being a feature in HubSpot.\n\nSomeone else may have some other suggestions for you, but my first thought is on the Events feature. <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/events/create-custom-events> This is available to Marketing Hub Enterprise only, though - is that the product you have?\n\nBut note that if you want to associate those Events with specific contacts in HubSpot you will need to collect their email address at some point - either through a HubSpot form or via API and your own form. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form>"
