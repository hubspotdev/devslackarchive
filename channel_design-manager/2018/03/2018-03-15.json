That site uses some hubl (for example the include function)that was deprecated. previously I would get warnings telling me I couldn’t have those tags when I did this with other sites. On this site I’m not having those warnings come up at all.\n\n*Did you guys decide to grandfather older sites to make it easier to migrate?* or am I just seeing a strange fluke and I should be worried."
