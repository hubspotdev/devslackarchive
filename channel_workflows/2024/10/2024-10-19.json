    "text": "Good evening I’m looking for some help as I have a strange problem. I have a custom action, the action url reaches out to a function that returns “hs_execution_state: BLOCK” as part of its response, this then blocks the contact correctly. The issue I am facing is that I don’t complete the workflow but just want it to drop out the step when the delay is finished which again it does. The issue is that each time it drops out of the step HubSpot logs it as an error and I don’t know how to prevent it.",
