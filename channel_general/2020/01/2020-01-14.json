They may help, and may be a good short term solution in a larger effort.\n\nThey do help users solve some issues for themselves but really you are offloading your work to your customers, and the resulting a11y experience may not be better as a result.\n\nthe primary concern I would have is that any of these solutions do not know the UI/UX you have implemented and how and why it works the way it works.\n\nExample an accordion - if you didn’t build it in an accessible way. There’s likely no reason this type of tool should be trusted to “fix” it for you, because the way you built the accordion is possibly unique to your site."
