Connects to you telephony system e.g. aircall/ twilio\n2. Gets the latest call engagement data for a specific phone number\n3. Then Logs the call activity against the contact record\nMy goal is to log activity incase our sales team forget to log it manually (rare occasion) or our 3rd party integration does not log the call against the record which is a known problem",
