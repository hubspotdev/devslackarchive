    "text": "We have successfully created a CMS React project and uploaded it. We are able to add modules to pages etc, so it’s functioning just fine. However I can’t see the project as described in the CRM page - <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/create-a-project#view-the-project-in-HubSpot|View the project in HubSpot>. My understanding was that if we are using CMS-React we will be able to see the projects regardless of the HubSpot products we’ve purchased. I do not have access to the “CRM UI Extensions” beta option. Also I’m pretty sure I had access to projects last week. Has something changed?",
