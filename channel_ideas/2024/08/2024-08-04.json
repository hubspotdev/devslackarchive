This view can clutter and hasn't got some love in the last couple of years...\nTherefore I've created an idea how this page could be made better.\n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Portal-overview-optimization/idi-p/1021350/highlight/true>\n\nIf you like this idea - give it a thumbs up",
