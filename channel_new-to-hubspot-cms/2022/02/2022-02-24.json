    "text": "Hello! I hope this isn't a stupid question, but I'm trying to build marketing emails in our Marketing Hub account, and I'm accustomed to tools like SalesForce Marketing Cloud, MailChimp, emfluence, etc. where I can edit the source code of an email in order to customize mobile and dark mode styles. I'm not a full-fledged CMS developer, I just know how to edit html and CSS of emails. I just want to confirm with this community that I'm not going to be able to use anything except the Drag-and-drop editor for our marketing emails, since I don't know how to set up sandboxes and local workflows and such. Is that correct?",

That's why I'm assuming my lack of development knowledge is my roadblock."
