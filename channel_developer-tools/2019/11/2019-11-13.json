This basically crawls the client's Shopify URL for products within a collection and renders it on a HubSpot page so that the user can Add to Cart from any landing page. I want to pass the collection id from Shopify into the javascript via HUBL. How can I do this?"

I want to swap out that id with a HUBL text field so that we can keep reusing the model for different products throughout the website. Right now, I just duplicate the module and manually edit the id, but I would like just one module that we can change via a text field for the user...any thoughts?"
