    "text": "Hi Everyone, is it possible to create a cron job in serverless function. I am trying to do that from webpack-serverless but the request is time-out after 20 sec, which is obvious.\nActually I am trying to perform a cron job to sync my data with Algolia Search. but we can not use its library directly in workflow custom codec. Therefore by using serverless-webpack I am calling Algolia-Search Api. What I am thinking is that to create a workflow with schedule and call the serverless to finally update the data to Algolia. Is there any flaw in my approch?\n\nThe scenario here is, our client wants to sync the HubDB table data with Algolia Search and create a cron job for it . I am not able to find any solution for cron job . That's why I am thinking to use workflow scheduler, otherwise I don't think there is much requirement for workflow in my case.\n\nI have already created serverless-webpack for algolia search. But to hit that API at scheduled time every(day/week or month) automatically within the HubSpot is the challenge for me. Otherwise, I tested it with <http://easycron.com|easycron.com> and it is working perfectly fine.",
