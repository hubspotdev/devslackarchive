    "text": "Thanks Dan for the explanation. Yes the problem you mentioned ((the sane table to store all categories)) is a known issue and there is no good solution for that at this time. The other thing we can do is by achieving this without dynamic table aproach and  do that by just using the HubL functions and modifying the page path by yourself (or use query params to send the params), but this may not be a best solution from SEO perspective."
