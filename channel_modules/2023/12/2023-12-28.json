    "text": "Image height - whatever image field settings I use, I cannot get `linked_image` to output the height of an image in the markup. Is this a known issue? I have tried different fields.json settings like resizable, responsive, size, but the height is never written in the markup. Even hardcoding it doesn't work.\n\n```{% set image = module.image %} \n\n {% linked_image\n            label=\"Image\",\n            src='{{ image.src }}',\n            alt='{{ image.alt }}',\n            width='{{ image.width }}',\n            height='500',\n            max_width='{{ image.max_width }}',\n            max_height='{{ image.max_height }}',\n            loading='{{ image.loading }}'\n        %}      ```\nAnyone else noticed this or found a solution? Apart from missing height dimension, the rest of the output is good (srcset, loading, alt), so I don't really want to go down the road of implementing custom image code, something like this using `resize_image_url()` but maybe that is the recommended approach? e.g.\n``` <img class=\"featured-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"{{ featuredPost.post_list_summary_featured_image }}\" srcset=\"{{ resize_image_url(featuredPost.post_list_summary_featured_image, 0, 0, 505) }} 505w, {{ resize_image_url(featuredPost.post_list_summary_featured_image, 0, 0, 705) }} 705w, {{ resize_image_url(featuredPost.post_list_summary_featured_image, 0, 0, 1040) }} 1040w, {{ featuredPost.post_list_summary_featured_image }} 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 505px, (max-width: 705px) 705px, (max-width: 1040px) 1040px, 1300px\" alt=\"{{ featuredPost.featured_image_alt_text | default('Image for ' ~ featuredPost.name, true) | escape }}\" />```",
