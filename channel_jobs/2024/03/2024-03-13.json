We would like to use an API connection to transfer a certain amount of data every day to HubSpot and with this connection, we would like to send automated email via workflow whenever there is an update on the property level. We also would like to assign tasks when needed. Is it possible to help me to understand to make this connection?",

    "text": "Hello Safa, You could also investigate a custom coded action directly in the HubSpot workflow or a serverless function on platform with HubSpot to complete this work. These are new features of HubSpot and would be fit for purpose for the work you are trying to accomplish. If you have specific questions you may try asking them in the <#C2YHAHB6K|api> channel or the <#C019VT42R8X|workflows> channel. If you need assistance with this work please feel free to let me know, I can likely assist. Thank you!"
