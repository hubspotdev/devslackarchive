    "text": "Hi, Everyone!\nI have a blog set up on HubSpot and use a child theme to display all the blogs on a blog listing page. I have more than 30 posts published in that blog.\n\n`{% set filtered_posts = blog_recent_posts('38', 1000 ) %}`        \n`{% for filtered_post in filtered_posts | sort(true, false, 'publish_date') %}`\n`{% endfor %}`\n\n*Issue:*\nNow I want to change the order of a few posts and want to display the 1st blog (recently published) in 25th position on the blog listing page. But I don't want to delete all the posts that are in between those numbers to get the desired ordering of posts. Is there any way to get the desired ordering of blogs on the blog listing template?\n\n*Note:*\nAt the end of each blog post, there are 2 CTAs to go to the previous post or to the next post. So, if I display posts in manual order (through their ids), the next/prev post links do not work properly because HubSpot stores the posts in publishing order.\n\nCan someone please help me?"
