That said if you were to use an image field and enable this option, you are the one who determines what to do with the fact image lazy loading was enabled. So you could use that as a way to trigger JavaScript to execute against an element with a background image.\n\nThat said that should be treated as a progressive enhancement. Native lazy loading is the better way to go."
