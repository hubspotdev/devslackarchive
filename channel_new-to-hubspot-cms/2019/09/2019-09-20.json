    "text": "Hey there! I'm Steph and Ive known of HubSpot CMS since 2010. I worked for a reseller of HubSpot back then and it was my introduction into marketing as a professional (and my education too). Since then I have done a gammit of activities, mostly focusing on UI and Automation. Recently my new employer became a HubSpot customer (YAY!) So I am back :slightly_smiling_face: :awthanks: and it never felt better. I have just under a decade of HTML and CSS experience (MANNNN that makes me feel old) and no current questions at the moment. I learned a bit about HubL yesterday (enough to help me wobble through a few modules for email) and am SO excited to dig in more. Great to meet you!"
