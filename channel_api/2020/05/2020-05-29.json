I create a machine using <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux|these instructions> chosing a container-optimized machine image. Then I `ssh`’d into the machine via the google console and did a `git clone` of my repo to get the files onto the newly created virtual machine. From there I just ran `docker-compose up --build` and it worked"
