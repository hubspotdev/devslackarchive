    "text": "Hi guys,\nI am trying to create a form, in which I want to implement a drop-down field that will be populated from a HubDB table. The form is created as a HubSpot form in the Marketing--&gt;Lead Capture--&gt;Forms module.\nThe challenge that I faced is that values from HubDB table can not be bound within a HubSpot form. Eventually I came up to this page: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form> , where it is elaborated how to process the form if it is a custom built form. Now I am struggling in how to embed this back-end code inside HubSpot... or with other words where should I put this process script, knowing that I am able to write only Hubl code inside pages.\nAlso I will be glad if someone can suggest some Hubl form building tool, plugin or something...\nAny help will be appreciated...\nThanks",
