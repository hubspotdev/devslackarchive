With hundreds of devices and configurations it is necessary to test each page against as many of them as possible. If you are unable to test against a physical device or desktop screen size then use a software-based approach to test against various configurations.  All templates should comply with HubSpot's 12 column grid system based on Bootstrap 2.x."
