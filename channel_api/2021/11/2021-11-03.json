I guess that brings me back to having to use the specific marketing events endpoints instead of the \"normal\" way. Right?",

Most companies are hiring many contractors to work on different aspects of the portal - if you give anyone enough access to get the API key they can download everything. You should rotate your API key every-time a staff member leaves (if they have access) as there is only one key you're going to risk breaking ALL of the integrations linked to the API key.\n2. With an App / oAuth you're able to rotate a single applications key. You'll only need to update the environment variables/code for that one application. \n3. Rate limits - each installation has it's own limits, whereas with an API key they all share the same, single limit."
