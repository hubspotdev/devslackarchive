When I “Test call” from the Documentation page (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/crm-custom-objects>) it correctly creates the custom object record and associates it to a contact. But when I attempt the same code using a Custom Code workflow action (copy pasta), it creates the custom object record with no error, but does not associate my desired contact to the newly created custom object. Are there any gotchas? Having trouble debugging this issue."
