It’s been working fine until I updated, and `hs create` now has its own additional prompts. What would be great is if there was either :\n1.) a flag to tell it to use default values and execute like it used to instead of prompting, like:\n`hs create module \"myModule\" \"src/modules\" --use-defaults`\nor 2.) a set of flags that lets you specify the all answers to the prompts you’re asking directly in the initial command, so that it can still execute without further input.\n`hs create module \"myModule\" \"src/modules\" --label=\"My Module\" --content-type=\"Page\" --global-module=true`"
