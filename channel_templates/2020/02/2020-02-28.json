I think the rendering of the CTA breaks it :confused: If you _really_ want a CTA to include a personalization token, you could create your own button (I have successfully used a personalization token in a link - it was a personalized URL - so this will probably work for the visible text, too, if that’s what you’re doing) - since it’s a linked button, you’ll be able to create an active list or workflow etc if needed for contacts who click on it, like you can any other link in email. I’m _pretty sure_ this would work :slightly_smiling_face: Good luck! Let us know here if you try it out?"
