But it’s also visible on the PDF after you click on the download button. I can’t remember having this issue before so it seems like something changed. Does anyone know a solution for this? I can’t exclude the domain from the cookie banner because that would mean I would also exclude my regular Landing Pages."

What I was thinking is HubSpot added security on standard objects but I would like to confirm",
