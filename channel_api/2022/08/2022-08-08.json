There is no v3 \"upsert\" method, so here are the strategies I can see. Has anyone encountered this and determined the best approach? Thanks in advance for any insights.\n\n• Use a legacy upsert endpoint provided by the v1 API\n• Search for every customer before choosing a v3 create or update endpoint – concerns about reaching a rate limit with this approach\n• Create every customer and fallback to update if the creation fails due to a duplicate email error\n• Try to keep a database of existing contacts refreshed on a regular interval for reference – concerns about race conditions\n"

When I use another custom property, I can’t find the object I’m looking for at all.\n\nIt seems like there’s some difference between the two properties or some characteristic of a deal which makes it unsearchable.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this problem?
