It would be something like a button in contact to send a message or something like that, but I could not find anything explaning how to do that. The only thing I found was how to connect/authenticate my app to HubSpot.\n\nCould any of you help here?\nThanks",

Just a confusing UX.  I had a customer want to \"try out\" a few templates when creating a page and didn't understand why he couldn't switch between the different ones."
