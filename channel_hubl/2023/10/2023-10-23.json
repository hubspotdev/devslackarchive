    "text": "Hello! Is there somebody with more knowledge on using section context? More specifically for style fields (referring to <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/templates/drag-and-drop-areas/sections#section-context|this>). I can't find a way to use a style value inside a template that imports a section. This is the syntax I'm using:\n\nInside the section template:\n```{% dnd_module\n        ...\n        style = {\n          content_alignment : context.content_alignment || center,\n          content_width : context.content_width || 554,\n        },\n        ...\n%}```\nInside the page template:\n```{% include_dnd_partial path='../sections/section-name.html' \n    context = {\n      content_alignment: end,\n      content_width: 954,\n    }\n  %}```\nBasically the value assigned to those variables inside the templates are ignored and the fallback/default ones are applied. Is there something I do that is wrong? I couldn't find much info about using context values with the styles fields, not sure if that syntax is correct either, but I've managed to get to it but trial &amp; error (basically until the syntax was accepted and there were no errors)\n\nThe regular values are working (the ones used for module fields, not style fields)\n\nThanks!",
