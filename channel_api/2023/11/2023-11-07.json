    "text": "Hey Tommie. In the context of HubSpot's OAuth implementation, refresh tokens do not technically expire on their own. However, there are certain conditions where a refresh token may become invalid before that period:\n1. A user manually revokes the refresh token from their account settings.\n2. HubSpot forcibly revokes the refresh token due to a security concern.\n3. The app is updated in such a way that the scopes change, requiring a new authorization.\nIt's important to handle cases where a refresh token may no longer work by prompting users to re-authorize your application. If you're ever in doubt, try using your refresh token to fetch a new access token—if the request fails because the refresh token is invalid, you would then guide the user through the authorization process again.\nWhen you use a refresh token to get a new access token, HubSpot will also return a new refresh token which you should store and use for subsequent refreshes.\nHere's the section on refreshing access tokens using refresh tokens from the docs <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/oauth/tokens>\n\nYou can get a new refresh token from this endpoint:",
