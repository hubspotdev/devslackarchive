    "text": "So, this is fun… Seems like Zapier’s Formatter for ISO 8601 timestamps will only output full UTC offsets (“-0000” or “-00:00\", which might not even be valid ISO 8601 according to Wikipedia, since it’s not “+00:00”). Meanwhile, HubSpot API’s ISO 8601 support for `datetime` only supports zero-offset Z, not full offsets. Oh, and Zapier seems to be truncating the milliseconds off epoch timestamps. Had to resort to a Custom Request webhook to pipe a Meeting Start Time from Chili Piper to HubSpot.\n\nWhy the partial ISO 8601 support?",
