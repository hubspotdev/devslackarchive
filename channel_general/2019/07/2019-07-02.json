On success it should send an email with the download link. The problem is that in the screenshot this is a net new contact and after clicking on the confirmation link in the double optin email it says \"This recipient has unsubscribed from this subscription type\" and does not send the download email. I'm wondering what's the issue and why is it saying the user has unsubscribed ?",
