Currently we are struggeling with custom fields on lineitem level and additional custom fields for the product object. We sell magazine subscriptions and need something like first magazin shipping date and last magazine shipping date in order to trigger churn prevention emails based on that trigger information. Any idea whether this is possible and where we can find further documentation on those topics? Thanks for your help!"
