    "text": "So, regarding legacy/new CTAs:\n\nIt looks like HS has removed the iframe that was causing much annoyance among analytics teams and developers, but as far as we see, the CTAs are still routed through a HubSpot-domain link (therefore obfuscating the true destination), which is not really solving the GTM problem. Is there any information on how this part will be resolved? Or have we just traded one problem for a different but equal problem?\n\nAt this point, my team is discussing leaving CTAs and HubSpot tracking behind and going solely with GTM as the industry standard, if the two systems can't play well together. We'd rather use both."

    "text": "I'm a little confused by the way themes work in HubSpot. I have inherited a site, there are 5 different themes installed on the account. I noticed when I make a page I can set a new theme, but it doesn't affect the already created page, just the page I'm currently making. I see what template each page uses, but it doesn't show what theme. When I go look at the templates in use, it does not have any of the names of the installed themes associated with it. None of the theme previews look anything like their site. I'm guessing the one that pops up is the most recent theme used but I'm just curious if that's being used for all of the site or if more than one of these 5 themes are in use.",
