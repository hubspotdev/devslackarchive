You should at least get the option when cloning the module so you don't have to create each field once more in the new module, but that isn't the case here either :thumbsdown:"

    "text": "<@U831KMEMS> HubSpot has the grid from bootstrap 2, you can add the functionality from newer versions of bootstrap in, in a hybrid fashion to allow for the design builder, or just roll your own coded template instead, but you will need to make sure you're properly handling each HS component.\n\nmost of your questions are  html javascript and CSS related and not really HubSpot related. \n\nI would highly encourage you to check out <http://css-tricks.com|css-tricks.com> which has great articles explaining how to achieve different looks with html css and javascript.\n\nBeyond that I think you'd get a lot of value out of <https://www.codecademy.com/>\n\nbased on what you said, I would focus on the css and jQuery tracks, maybe vanilla javascript as well(there's always the debate of which is better to learn first, I think jQuery will atleast get you up and going faster on your project, but down the road I highly recommend learning javascript as well, jQuery alone will only get you so far)"
