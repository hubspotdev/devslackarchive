    "text": "Hello once more! I have a module that is a repeatable group (6 images) and it should be displayed in two rows. I use div class 'row', then class 'span3' then class 'image'. Sadly the bottom row is moved 10px to the right and it seems that the beginning of second row is a gutter between 2 images - its like span class cut through this module and prevented from aligning it properly. Has anyone the clue how can I make my group alligned properly? No ''flex'' commands are working :confused:",
