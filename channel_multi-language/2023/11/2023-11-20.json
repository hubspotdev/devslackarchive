    "text": "Hello, apologies for the late response!\n\nThis currently can’t be done through the native HubSpot Multi-language functionality — it’s a bit of a gap in the platform’s capabilities.\n\nThere _are_ some workarounds for implementing changes to global UI content based on the current domain or language, but they _do_ require you to hard-code a good amount into your templates. Using <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/variables#website-pages-variables|the >`content.language.languageTag` and `request.headers[\"accept-language\"]`<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/variables#http-request-variables| objects>, you can swap out template content based on the current page’s language or the user’s system language.\n\nYou were also specifically asking about swapping out by domain, which can be done with the `request.domain` object, like this:\n```{% if request.domain == \"<http://example.com|example.com>\" %}\n  {# Content for <http://example.com|example.com> goes here. #}\n{% endif %}```\nI hope this helps!"
