    "text": "I recently designed and coded an email for a client which featured a large banner with their logo embedded. On top of this, it swaps out responsively to a mobile formatted version with the same image and logo embedded. Part of the brief was to ensure it was 100% accessible so it could be read by all their customers.\n\nI wrote a short article on how I achieved this and it highlights how a custom coded email can help you stand out from your competition by accommodating every reader, something many drag and drop editors struggle with.\n\n<https://emailancer.com/blog/how-to-make-a-responsive-emails-swap-out-header-accessible>"
