The default global RSS feed works fine, but using the {% rss_feed %} hubl tag doesn't seem to work at all (it doesn't render anything in the drag and drop builder). My use case is showing the most recent feed from a wordpress blog as a \"featured\" item at the top of the email, then later on in the body showing the remaining posts. Any advice here?",
