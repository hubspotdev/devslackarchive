Or even add in a Twitter Label / Data tag to the header `&lt;meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Data\"&gt;&lt;meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Label\"&gt;`. This can't be done via JS as it wont be read by the validators or checks. I would prefer to pull this value from a variable on the page."
