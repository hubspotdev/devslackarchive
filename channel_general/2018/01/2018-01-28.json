    "text": "Hi, I have been able to get HubDB rows rendering in my email templates, essentially I am mapping a field into the row params and returning my results; Happy Days! However, I am struggling to make my component reusable within the email template... Have I hit a limitation here, documentation is failing me and I cannot work out how to simply \"add a module\" in the email editor, much like I can in the page designer. Thanks (HubSpot n00b)."
