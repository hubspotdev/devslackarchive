I’ve tried implementing it but haven't been able to get it to work, and I also went through the documentation but couldn’t find a relevant solution.\n\n\n*Scenario :* \n_I need to create a functionality in HubSpot for my team of 4 doctors:_\n\n    _-Doctor A is available from 9am to 12pm_\n    _-Doctor B is available from 12pm to 3pm_\n    _-Doctor C is available from 3pm to 6pm_\n    _-Doctor D is available from 6pm to 9pm_\n\n_I want to create a calendar showing their availability. When a user books a meeting through the calendar link, the meeting should automatically be scheduled with the doctor who is available at that selected time._\n\n_For example, if a user, say X, wants to book a meeting at 1pm (from 1pm to 1:30pm), they should be able to book it, and the system should automatically schedule the meeting with Doctor B (since Doctor B is available at that time)._ ",

Not to worry Anmol, this is quite simple.\n\nIf you add the Doctors to a team in HubSpot and get them to link their calendars with HubSpot, HubSpot will automatically detect their availability including working hours and only show available persons within that range.\n\nI have this set up for my operations teams and it works like a dream, especially useful to consider using as well are the padding options between meetings to ensure that someone can't book a meeting within a period (for example, they can't book a meeting that starts in 5 minutes time but maybe they can book a meeting that starts in 2 hours time)."

It enables tracking page views anonymously, and I don’t think we do what the user claimed:\n> It records anonymous activity which can later be linked to a speciifc user through a form submission.\nWithout having a cookie, the only way we could potentially link a user later to their traffic hitting the tracking cookie would be like through IP address or header info logging and even then I wouldn’t trust that enough to consider it accurate to actually link the info to the user later. So I seriously doubt we’d implement something that complicated for this scenario with such little benefit."
