    "text": "Hi everyone!\nI have spent two days trying to make custom module to work. Need to filter line items by expiration date (send email to customers with the list of line items which are expired or about to expire). cbm_expiration_date is datepicker property . The only progress I could get it to filter everything by quantity ==1 in the if statement as an experiment but that is not exactly what I need… (Attached screenshot is an example of that module where this line {% if line_item.cbm_expiration_date &lt; now() %} were replaced by this one {% if line_item.quantity == 1 %}\n\n<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1463Tk47ILuYe2bSN90NJ4_TFb6dfXIY5/view?usp=sharing>\n```{% set objects = crm_associations(deal.hs_object_id,\"HubSpot_DEFINED\", 19, \"limit=200\" , \n      \"name, hs_url, price, amount, description, quantity, hs_images, cbm_expiration_date\n      \") %} \n&lt;div class='cbm-module order-items'&gt;\n   &lt;table class='items-cbm'&gt;\n    &lt;tbody&gt;\n      {% for line_item in objects.results %}\n       {% if line_item.cbm_expiration_date &lt; now() %}   \n          &lt;tr&gt;\n           \n            &lt;td class='item-product-image'&gt;\n              &lt;img src=\"{{line_item.hs_images}}\" width='130'&gt;\n            &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class='item-product-name'&gt;\n              {{line_item.name}}\n            &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class='item-cost'&gt;\n              Qty: {{line_item.quantity | int}}\n            &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td class='item-cost'&gt;\n              {{line_item.cbm_expiration_date}} \n            &lt;/td&gt;\n          &lt;/tr&gt;\n        {% endif %}\n       {% endfor %}\n\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\n  &lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;```",

However, the only way I can still find to grab a contact property that contains a URL to link the image to was to use hubl in the module backend and it's STILL rendering this hubl in the email editor. The functionality works but it doesn't look great in the email editor due to the rendered hubl.",
