    "text": "Hi there. I'm embedding an email address in the URL tied to a CTA, but the encoding doesn't look right. The email is pulled from the contact, `<mailto:test+1@gmail.com|test+1@gmail.com>`. The encoded email in the URL appears as `<http://test%201%40gmail.com|test%201%40gmail.com>`. That `+` character should be encoded as `%2B`. Am I doing something wrong? The closest forum help I've found is <https://integrate.HubSpot.com/t/script-contact-email/8390>"
