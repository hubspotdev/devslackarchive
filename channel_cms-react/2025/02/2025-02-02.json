    "text": "Hi everyone, what is the best practice way of preloading images in modules. This works for me, but it's a bit weird. Specifically, the link is different in the javascript logic from the jsx so I have to replace the start of the link. Presumably, something to do with server-side rendering?\n\nI feel like I'm missing something because preloading is such an important thing. Is there a hook that preloads images that I just haven't found? Or a way to ensure images are preloaded for custom components in the HubSpot app itself?\n\n\n`const displaySrc = imageSrc.replace(`\n    `\"<http://20646833.fs1.HubSpotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/20646833|20646833.fs1.HubSpotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/20646833>\",`\n    `\"<http://rosterlab.com/hubfs|rosterlab.com/hubfs>\"`\n  `);`\n\n`useInlineHeadAsset(() =&gt; &lt;link rel=\"preload\" as=\"image\" href={displaySrc} /&gt;); // Preload LCP`\n\n`...`\n\n`&lt;img`\n    `src={imageSrc}`\n    `alt=\"RosterLab intro\"`\n    `className={styles.introImg}`\n`/&gt;`",
