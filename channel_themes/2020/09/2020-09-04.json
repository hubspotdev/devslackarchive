Any new findings?\n\nThe only guide that I found was this <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/cms-general/redesign-and-relaunch-your-site-with-content-staging>\n\nI just can’t imagine how to work like with about 50 pages that will get totally redesigned (styles, markup, content) :see_no_evil: and how to get live with all new pages at once. How about the urls? From a SEO perspective they need to be the same as before the redesign.\n\nWell… maybe I’m only a bit afraid because I don’t have any experience with HubSpot."
