    "text": "Hi all! In our company, we are redesigning the whole website. We go page by page. So I created a page and I need to publish it and unpublish the old one. HS warns me about broken links. If the link is the same on the specific subpage (landing page), do I need to do smth extra or can I just unpublish the old one and publish the new one? For marketing, there is another person. :smile: Thanks!",
