    "text": "Hello all. I am new at HubSpot so I apologize if this is not the correct channel to address this.\n\nI am setting tracking on a email template using Segment. Its documentation states that the img tag source must contain a base64 encoded object that will contain certain information, e.g. email subject, recipient email and more. Basically, these informations are HubSpot's properties at a contact level. My question is: how can I perform this encoding in the template ? Does HubSpot have a method for this ?"
