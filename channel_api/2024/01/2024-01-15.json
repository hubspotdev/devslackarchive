From there I set up a *target url* and some *subscription events* for the entities: *deal, line item*. I added all the necessary *scopes*.\n\nAfter doing all this I tried to test it by creating a new deal with some line items inside but no webhook event was triggered. I have tested my endpoint using Postman and it works.\n\nDo I need to do any other config before it starts working?\n\nThank you all!",
