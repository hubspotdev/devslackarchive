    "text": "Hello,\nI'm trying to create a serverless function in HubSpot using custom dependencies stored in a package.json file. When doing npx hs upload, it fails to upload the package.json with the error \"A .functions directory can only contain serverless.json, .js, and .md files\". npx hs deploy gives the error \"hubId [ID] does not have access to serverless builds\".\nI can test them locally just fine with npx hs functions server, but I'm at a loss as to how to actually deploy them. Has anyone dealt with a similar issue in the past? Thanks!"
