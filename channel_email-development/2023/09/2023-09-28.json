    "text": "Hi there, I am trying to write some HubL to personalise email content based on a contact's properties. We have a property for the contact's assigned branch location, and so I'm writing conditional logic that says if branch location is DUR, display Durham, if JAX, display Jacksonville, and so on. I tested my logic with contact.firstname first to make sure everything was working as expected. Then I changed property and it stopped working, so the issue lies with that. I can't find information or just an example of how to target custom contact properties, the internal name is \"sb_branch_location\" but \"<http://contact.sb|contact.sb>_branch_location\" isn't working... I'm not looking for support just information. I have written this type of logic many times in different systems: Iterbale's Handlebars, Braze's Liquid, even Mailchimp. I can't find any documentation or an example on this fairly basic personalisation exercise (i.e. is it \"object.group.internal name\", something else...)",
