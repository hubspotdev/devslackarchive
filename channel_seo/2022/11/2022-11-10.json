The <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/domains-and-urls/view-and-edit-your-HubSpot-hosted-domain-sitemap|documentation> from HubSpot mentioned HubDB dynamic pages being added directly if the parent page is added, however it doesn't seem to work for dynamic pages built from Custom Objects. Any ideas on how to get these pages added to the sitemap.xml?"
