    "text": "Hi we are trying to figure out how to get the contact object to post over when we receive a workflow extension request from HubSpot. This comment by <@UQ922BSPP> gave me hope that we could, but so far no luck in determining how to tell HubSpot to post the entire contact object. Right now we just get `objectType` AND `objectId` .\n\nDoes anyone know how to tell HubSpot to include the contact object in the HTTP post to our server?\n\n&gt; Currently, while using the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/workflows/webhook_information|Workflow Webhook action>, it is not possible to configure the POST body being sent. If you'd like to have full control over the payload of the request, I'd recommend for your team to explore the <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/workflow-extensions/workflow-extensions-overview|Workflow extensions overview>.\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Limiting-Webhook-Post-Data/td-p/354659>",
