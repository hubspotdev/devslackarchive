    "text": "Hi Laurent! Afraid there isn't a way to add in new RSS tokens that pull from other attributes of the RSS feed, right now. We've heard similar requests for this in the past and have it on our radar for a future update but for the moment the only supported tokens are:\n- `{{ post.url }}` - pulls from the RSS `link` attribute\n- `{{ post.title }}` - pulls from the RSS `title` attribute\n- `{{ post.author_line }}` - pulls from the RSS `author` attribute\n- `{{ post.publish_date }}` - pulls from the RSS `pubDate` attribute\n- `{{ post.featured_image }}` - this one is only supported for HubSpot hosted blogs I'm afraid, not RSS feeds\n- `{{ post.summary }}` - pulls from the RSS `description` attribute\n- `{{ post.comment_url }}` - pulls from the RSS `comments` attribute\nSome of them have fallbacks too and will pull from other attributes like `author` to `dc:creator`\nIn your case you're looking to pull in the `image` attribute from your feed (if I understand correctly) but at the moment we don't have a corresponding token that will ingest that data from the feed I'm afraid."
