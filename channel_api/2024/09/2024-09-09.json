Our integration works, but we want to improve it in the following way:\n\nWe want customers to be able to call using our sipsim service when clicking this button. Specifically, so that the call is made from the customer's mobile phone, and not through HubSpot. Neither the option of calling through the browser, nor the option of calling through the HubSpot app on the phone suits us. Specifically through the phone.\n\nBasically all  we need to make it possible on our side is to get webhook with these fields:\n\n1. caller\n2. receiver\n3. some kind of ID of client\nTell me please if that possible!",

I have an enumeration property in HubSpot, and I want to add that property to an input field so the user can directly select from the property’s values. This approach works perfectly with the “owner” property, but it’s not working with any object property.\nHere’s the working example for the owner property:\n\n```{\n    \"typeDefinition\": {\n        \"name\": \"widgetOwner\",\n        \"type\": \"enumeration\",\n        \"fieldType\": null,\n        \"options\": [],\n        \"optionsUrl\": null,\n        \"referencedObjectType\": \"OWNER\",\n        \"externalOptions\": false,\n        \"externalOptionsReferenceType\": null\n    },\n    \"supportedValueTypes\": [\n        \"STATIC_VALUE\"\n    ],\n    \"isRequired\": false\n}```\nI’d like to achieve the same functionality for my any object property. Does anyone have any advice or know how will it work with object properties?\nThanks!",

I imagine there's some way to tell your codegen to just _always_ use that method"
