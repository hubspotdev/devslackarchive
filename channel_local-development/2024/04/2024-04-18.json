A test portal is an option if you are creating an app for the marketplace and want an enterprise-level test area - it only creates a new test portal with two test contacts and otherwise has no objects and just standard properties.  But I like to use a test account for private apps that I just want to quickly test and don't really need a sandbox.  Good to have options."
