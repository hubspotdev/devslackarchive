You can set up your HubSpot developer app according to these docs: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/overview|https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/overview> and there are a lot of different ways your app can interface with the HubSpot UI. There are workflow extensions <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/workflow-extensions/workflow-extensions-overview|https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/workflow-extensions/workflow-extensions-overview> and CRM cards (these can pop up iframes) <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/extensions/custom-cards|https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/extensions/custom-cards>\n\nHope that helps."
