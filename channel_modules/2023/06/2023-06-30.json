    "text": "hello all! I am having trouble with customizing the HubSpot blog \"tag\" page - i.e. <http://blog.companyhere.com/tag/category-name|blog.companyhere.com/tag/category-name>. I am trying to incorporate the customized \"recent posts\" module that I created because the client likes the styling. I placed it within the blog_tag.html file, and it's pulling in correctly - however, it's showing *all* posts, rather than posts from that specific tag. How can I get it to dynamically pull posts from the correct tag? There are six total tags on the blog.\n\nHappy to provide code and more info if someone is willing to help! if you are confident that you can troubleshoot, I will pay $100 to whoever can successfully complete the module. :smile: "
