    "text": "It was designed to work this way. You may be able to add logic yourself to change this.\n\nEffectively the GH action uses the HubSpot CLI under the hood. It is given the current branch and all of it’s files. Then the action uses the CLI to upload the assets. If you were to figure out how GH provisions the assets you could perhaps find the diff in the files using some GH APIs and delete everything that wasn’t changed, then run the upload.\n\nThat would make the processing time faster.\n\nA side aspect that does take time and there isn’t really a great workaround is the CLI gets installed on the serverless function each time the action gets run. Installation takes time."
