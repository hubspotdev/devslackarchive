Anywho,\n\nWhen I try to run hs project upload to upload a CRM Card, i'm getting this error:\n\n```The post in account 454179 was bad. Platform version is missing from your project configuration. Please add the platformVersion field to the hsproject.json file, then try uploading the project again. Available versions: [2023.2].```\nhowever, I _do_ have 2023.2 in the hsproject file:\n\n```{\n  \"name\": \"crmCard\",\n  \"srcDir\": \"src\",\n  \"platformVersion\": \"2023.2\"\n}```\nhas anyone run into this in the past? it provides the same error if I try to rename the CRM Card and push it",
