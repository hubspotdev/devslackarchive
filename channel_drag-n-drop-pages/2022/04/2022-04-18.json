    "text": "Hey guys, I have a weird issue. I have a theme page where between the content sections and the global footer, there is a blank area with the \"drop modules here\" message. Of course, it doesn't actually show on the page or take space, but I see it in the editor. Generally, it's a leftover section that I can delete, but on this particular site, I have no options to do anything with it. I can't actually drop any modules on to it either. Only right above it. I have menu options for other sections, columns, etc, but nothing for this leftover element. Any suggestions on how to get rid of it??"
