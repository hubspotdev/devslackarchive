    "text": "With GraphQL I’m pulling data from a HubDB, filtering on a multi-select column.\nI have 15 rows total, 5 of them being in the “category” X I’m filtering on. My `limit` is 10.\n\nI’m expecting to see `total` of 5, since this is the amount of `items`returned, and `hasMore` of `false` , however this is not the case.\nThe `total` shows all my rows, 15, even though my `items` array only consists of 5. This causes `hasMore` to be true, because my limit is lower than total.\n\nIf I up my `limit` to 20, `hasMore` is false, because my total is now less than my limit, even though I still only get 5 rows.\n\nAm I completely misunderstanding something? Is this intended behaviour, or is it a bug?",
