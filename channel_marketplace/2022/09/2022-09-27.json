    "text": "<@U01QVR44MEY> thanks. What I decided to do instead is to have the install link go to the payment page, and then have the success page go to a custom page with the install link in the button. That way, I get the customer id and subscription id pretty much at the same time as the install. If i save the customer id as a global variable and then recall that when they verify the install, where I get the portal id, I can connect the 2 together. It's based on the assumption that they will install pretty much after they pay, but it's the only way I can figure out how to connect the 2."
