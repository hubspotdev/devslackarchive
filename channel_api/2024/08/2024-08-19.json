We have interesting problem:\nWe are creating contacts through form submission api (I added imaginary name and email):\n```[2024-08-19T13:15:04.225] .DEBUG: POST <https://forms.HubSpot.com/submissions/v3/integration/submit/5663185/c60c8f3f-4f4a-4cea-bded-d49917f0858e{>\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"firstname\",\"label\":\"firstname\",\"value\":\"loremipsum\"},{\"name\":\"lastname\",\"label\":\"lastname\",\"value\":\"dolors\"},{\"name\":\"email\",\"label\":\"email\",\"value\":\"<mailto:testing+123@domain.com|testing+123@domain.com>\"},```\nAfter this we get\n```[2024-08-19T13:15:04.661] .DEBUG: 200 {\"inlineMessage\":\"\"} [] []```\nAfter this we try to get contact and get 404.

I am aware that contact needs to exist to be added to list. Thank you in advance!",

    "text": "Hey <@U07H1NCGLLF> , it's not officially stated that delays exist or how long it is but your first code is creating submission not a contact ergo delay is expected with internal HubSpot processing to create contact.\n\nIf short time is mandatory you could create contact first and then send submission. Look up property history on contact and cross reference with form submission timestamp to see what roughly the delay is and if it meets your requirements. Happy coding :wink:"
