    "text": "Hi All -\n\nI am excited to announce that we have released additional endpoints as part of Lists API v3 to create, update, delete, and fetch lists.\n\nThe new endpoints have been added to the API documentation <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/lists|here>. Additionally, you can learn more about the definition of a list and its filters at the newly published docs <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/lists-filters|here> and <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/list-filters-definitions|here>.\n\nAs a quick note, because lists is currently undergoing a change to its time filter format, all time-based filters have been disabled for create/update as part of this initial release of List CRUD operations.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions in regards to these new endpoints. Thanks!"
