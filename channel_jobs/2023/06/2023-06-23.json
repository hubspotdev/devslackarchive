I'm happy to make the referral.\n\nI don't have any major needs that aren't being met by the out-of-the-box drag-and-drop templates, but more than anything I'd love to add CSS shapes! Swoops and waves and stuff. Also, ideally, a hero image-type module for greater accessibility, vs. baked-in text. Oh, and brand font if possible.\n\nSo:\n-css shapes\n-hero module\n-brand font\n-also maybe blog module",
