After todayâ€™s announcement on the `style` tab and smart content being available on all modules, I have some questions for modules and themes that are already in the marketplace.\n\nIf we want to update our modules to give users a consistent experience, how will that be handled? To my knowledge, version control is not really something that exists in the marketplace.\n\nAlso, is there an update process for customers?\n\nWhat are the best versioning/update practices?"
