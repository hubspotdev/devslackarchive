I want customer actions (enabled/disabled feature XYZ for example) to update Contact/Deal properties in HubSpot, which will then enroll contacts into Workflows\nIn discussing with HS support, they’ve sent me this <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/v2/update_contact_property> which would involve changing all of our segment events with these calls. This isn’t feasible.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience here, or could assist? It would be so appreciated :pray:",
