The forms works while nobody edit the pages, if someone just enter to edit mode, the form disappear and we can’t recover even in the revision history. Our biggest problem is that we know, thanks for the “dependencies” option, that our modules with forms are in more than 300 different website pages and landing pages with 4 different clients. I really need help of some HubSpot dev (if speak Spanish is mucho mejor). Please help us friends :pray:",
