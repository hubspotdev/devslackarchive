I am a 24 year old software guru, designer, and have built/continuing to build a B2B lead subscription tool for small businesses and agencies. Are there any agency owners, or anyone at all, who would be open to a chat so I can share more about my tool, and learn more about their agency?\n\nLet me know - Thanks!"
