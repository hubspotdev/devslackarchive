This you cant do with the normal D&amp;D template.)\nIn the normal D&amp;D you can add mobile styling (style tag) within the template.\n\nIs there anyway I can do this for the new beta D&amp;D template?\n\nAs adding custom style tag to every module doesn't seem to play well\n\nPlease let me know if anyone can help :)",
