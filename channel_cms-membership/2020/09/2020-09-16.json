    "text": "Hey all :wave: I'm building a membership site for a client and trying to integrate Stripe because membership content is for paying members only. But wondering if anyone pulled this off with HubSpot without depositfix and similar?\n\nI'm using Stripe Checkout client-only integration, so when user fills the form it redirects them to the Stripe checkout page. Then I'm using Zapier to detect new customer on Stripe and update a contact on HubSpot. The problem is delay of ~15mins with Zapier, user has to wait 15mins to receive email to set password.\n\nDoes someone know what would be the best practice when implementing paying membership with HubSpot? Maybe doing Stripe integration with serverless functions? Please help! :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks!"

That query is your \"short term\" trigger in HubSpot to create a list (IE: has visited the url including \"/success?success=1\" to have a confirmed payment. Then use zapier to reconcile afterwards."
