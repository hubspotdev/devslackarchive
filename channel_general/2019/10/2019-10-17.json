We have date-pickers on our forms and multipledropdowns so we really need to capture that data. We're using external forms because we need to add an address completion tool (essentially an extra field+some javascript). Anyone have any workarounds or otherways address completion has been achieved within a HS form?",

There should be no issue with you doing whatever you need with your form then submitting it to HubSpot via the Forms API. Let me know if you run into any issues when doing that or if I have mis-understood the question"
