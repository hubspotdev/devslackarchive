You could use the \"read all properties\" endpoint, and use \"product\" as your object type (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/properties>). In the response, there should be a property per currency enabled in the relevant HubSpot portal (e.g. hs_price_gbp, hs_price_eur etc.)\n\nThere might be a more efficient way, but that's the best I can think of right now. Hope that helps :)"
