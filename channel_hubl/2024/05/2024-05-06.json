I know I can defer the JS file loading when loading a form to an external site, but what about forms in HubSpot pages? I'm not loading forms/v2.js, it's handled by HubSpot, and the impact on the page is huuuuuge.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I wish we had more control over the code that HubSpot generates. Sometimes, there's no way we can fix what's coming from HubSpot, and need to compromise on other parts of the website in order to meet the performance KPIs\n\nEspecially if there is a cookie banner added, chatbot, forms etc., it's getting rather damaging to the core web vitals on Google speed test\n\n<@U7SL518D6> <@UD53A9UUR>, I'm wondering whether the dev team is aware of these issues and whether there are any plans to address them in upcoming updates. Thanks!"
