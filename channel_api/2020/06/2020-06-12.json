Is there any reason I can't just make a HubSpot app in order to make use of those api's? It wouldn't be listed on the app marketplace, it would just be for a custom solution. Does HubSpot shut down apps not on the marketplace?"

Basically it’s up to that team to let you download the file right now even though they use the file manager for storage. We’re tightening down permissions in our next version and looking at doing app specific file ownerships. We need to work with the engagement team to get their feedback on allowing downloading of attachments since they control the content, we just store it. Feel free to open a support ticket for the engagements team to get more help from them on this."
