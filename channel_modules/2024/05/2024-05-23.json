    "text": "Ahh - I see. Thank you for clearification!\n\nSo - you're not the first person who would like to do this. :slightly_smiling_face: I've seen quite a few such \"requests\" over the last couple of years(including myself). Unfortunately nothing happend since then.\nFrom a technical perspective I'd say the rich-text module and the rich-text function (in a module) are handled slightly different by HubSpot. What I would assume is that there is at least one non-public option which tells HubSpot that it's a custom or a default module and how it should be handled.\nFor instance: You have the whole new AI generation option in the rich-text module but it's missing in a custom module.\nAnother fact: Before themes were a thing there was a \"HTML\" module which could be downloaded from the marketplace for free. It was basically the same default rich-text module but was printing out HTML code. Was a great thing to add custom HTML code to the page. Once themes were released and the marketplace rebooted it disappeared.\nMy recomendation on this: Bring your idea to the <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/idb-p/HubSpot_Ideas|HubSpot ideas area> of the community. I'm sure there are a lot of people who would \"upvote\" it"
