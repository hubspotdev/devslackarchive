    "text": "Hi everyone. I'm trying to add custom events to a heavily trafficked ecommerce site. These are events like \"Added to Cart\", \"Download Preview\", \"Create Collection\", and \"Searched For\". I'm really struggling to understand the 2,000 custom event limit, as we would likely churn through that in a week.\n\nAre there any workarounds? Am I understanding this incorrectly? How is this feature supposed to be used?",
