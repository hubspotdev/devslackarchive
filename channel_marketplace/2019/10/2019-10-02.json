Templates that do not pass QA for violating any of these guidelines will be moved to the bottom of that queue when they are resubmitted.\n&gt;Please note that HubSpot is unable to provide information about your template’s place in the queue. Following the directions here closely will help ensure that your template passes the first time it is run through the QA process, but as volume fluctuates our team is unable to provide a timeframe in which your template will be inspected.\n\nI don’t know if your submission did not pass QA I just included that comment as it may give extra context in that situation.\n\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/articles/kcs_article/resources/what-are-the-submission-requirements-for-the-template-marketplace#8-additional-notes-on-the-process>"
