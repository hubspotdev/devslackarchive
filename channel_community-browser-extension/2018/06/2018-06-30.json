    "text": "crushed out a couple things(tab feature, and I moved the dark theme toggle to the popup ). Still need some visual tweaks but it functions.\n\nAlso there’s definitely some code that could be written better, hell I re-used HubSpot’s toggle switch UI, it’s extremely verbose for no reason. They could have done it as a css checkbox and used some before’s and afters but instead it’s controlled with javascript and has tons of elements.\n\nWill go through and tweak it later to improve it.\n\nJust wanted to get that tab feature out of the way as other feature ideas shouldn’t really be implemented until that ones done."
