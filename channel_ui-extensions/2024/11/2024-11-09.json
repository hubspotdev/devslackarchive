    "text": "Yep that was it, thank you <@U06NHDWP5UG> :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nFollow up question for you, is there an easy way to simply manage environments for the extension? That is, I want the same codebase to be used for dev/qa/staging/prod but I don't want to have duplicate source code just to simply swap out the app ID, project ID, etc\n\nOr is this more of a question about executing the commands at the correct time? using HubSpot CLI `upload` `deploy` `dev`,  is it simply that `upload` doesn't deploy the changes to all existing installs of the app? What is the purpose of just executing `upload` without doing a `deploy` ?"
