    "text": "Possible bug report here, wanted to see if anyone else has encountered it.\n\nMy theme footer has a dnd area with a dnd partial in it\n\n```{% dnd_area \"footer_contact\"\nlabel=\"Footer\",  \nclass=\"footer_contact white_text\"\n%}\n\n{# Contact Field #}\n\n\n{% include_dnd_partial path=\"../../sections/call-to-action.html\" context={\n'content': '&lt;center&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Label&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam vehicula &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/center&gt;',\n'background_setter': theme.global_colors.primary.color,\n'form_id':'96653c19-0674-4a44-b9f0-8c17addaa8f5'\n       } %}\n\n{% end_dnd_area %}```\nThis works fine but when I try to edit my blog-post template I get the error:\n\n`line 82: Blog Post templates cannot contain drag and drop areas`\n\nIf I replace the partial in the footer with the actual content of the partial, the error goes away.\n\nThe downside of that is that I lose the ability to give the section a class. I suppose my workaround will be to just wrap the dnd_area in a div\n\nI've tested with boilerplate sections and I'm getting the same results",
