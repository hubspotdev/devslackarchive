I've a question similar to what is seen on this thread way back from 2017: <https://integrate.HubSpot.com/t/hide-form-to-users-who-have-already-submitted-it/6382>\n\nWith the up-and-commence of custom modules and dynamic hubDB pages, I'm in a situation where I'm attempting to create a workflow where the form is hidden and the content is shown based on a contacts particular stage on a particular list. I cannot use a smart module for this.\n\nDoes anyone know if there is something available within the hubL variables or API functions, or would this need to be a fully custom dev project?"
