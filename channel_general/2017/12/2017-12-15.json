    "text": "My short response would be:\nGoogle has said that they treat content on a subdomain vs subfolder roughly equal (Matt Cutts from Google: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MswMYk05tk> note, most likely Rand’s whiteboard will show up as the second video after this plays). It is still believed in general thought that subfolder is better than subdomain (Rand Fishkin says: <https://moz.com/blog/subdomains-vs-subfolders-rel-canonical-vs-301-how-to-structure-links-optimally-for-seo-whiteboard-friday>). We have seen better results moving a blog from a subdomain to a subfolder with Decisiv, an account that I worked on that benefited from a move from a subdomain to a subfolder about a year and a half ago.\n\nThe real item to think about this, in the grand scheme of an inbound website/methodology:\nOverall landing pages in general don’t rank well from an organic standpoint because they don’t really have “content” in them. (This is a reason for ungated content, as the content is on the page and will rank better). In the grand scheme of things, landing pages are towards the end of the user flow.  Your blog posts and content on your website pages are going to draw the user in, where we have CTAs to our landing pages to  bring visitors into the funnel.  The idea that a campaign would consist of a few blog posts, some ctas, and a landing page/offer and a confirmation page, so you would want your entry points to a campaign or offer to be the pages that rank.\n\nI’ll add a blog post from Darmesh (ceo of HubSpot) here: <https://inbound.org/blog/the-sub-domain-vs-sub-directory-seo-debate-explained-in-one-flow-chart>"

Pages in primary domain do not get lift (like at all in my experience) when inbound is on a subdomain."
