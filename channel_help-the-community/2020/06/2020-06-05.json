Field values for example can’t be used inside of those two files, because we would need to load that CSS and JS once for each instance of the module to ensure for each instance the field value based css/js is implemented.\nThat would be very performance inefficient.\n\nSuggestions for how to implement instance specific styling and javascript will be in the previously mentioned new doc."
