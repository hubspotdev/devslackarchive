    "text": "Hello,\nI have run into an issue with email modules and setting variables. I have an email that uses a \"control\" module, where you make some selections and it set various hubl variables that affect other modules. This email continues to work, however cloning the email or trying to make a new one with the modules no longer works. I tried to simplify it to just the vary basic \"set variable : get variable\", and it seems there has been some update that breaks this, it will no longer find variables set in other modules.",
