    "text": "We’re currently in the process of rolling this out within the share pages for forms. We have some markup changes to finalise before running an accessibility audit on this. Since we have complete control over the share pages it makes sense for us to implement this first. Once we’ve finalised the markup we’re going to be making this available for embed/cms forms. It’s a difficult roll-out as it’s a completely new markup and we don’t want to disrupt any customers. We’re hoping to have this available before the end of Q3 though."
