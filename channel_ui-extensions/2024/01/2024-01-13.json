    "text": "Hey everyone. I'm building in integration with a 3rd party and need to be able to receive webhook requests from that third party. I am trying to set an `appFunction` up with an endpoint but when I try to make a request to that endpoint I'm getting an error. I've looked through the docs and can't seem to figure out why this endpoint is not accessible. Any chance someone has hit this type of issue before?\n\nserverless.json:\n```{\n  \"runtime\": \"nodejs16.x\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"secrets\": [\"ENCRYPT_KEY\"],\n  \"appFunctions\": {\n    \"webhook_project\": {\n      \"file\": \"webhook_project.js\",\n      \"endpoint\": {\n        \"path\": \"webhook_project\",\n        \"method\": [\"POST\"]\n      }\n    },\n....```\nError response when submitting the POST request:\n```{\n    \"status\": \"error\",\n    \"message\": \"Couldn't find the requested POST webhook_project.
