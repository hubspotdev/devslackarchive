Looking forward to learning from those who have walked the path before me. I'm building an app for my employer that would be used as a CRM by the sales team. Anyone who have experience with HubSpot + WordPress + CRM I'm looking for advice, mentors, code snippets or directions. :smile: Sending good vibes all around",
