    "text": "Does anyone know how to prevent HubSpot from changing URL links in things such as the navbar and footer on pages with translations? Currently we have a few pages that we tried out with the translation feature, with the English version being the master and other languages being \"translations\". When going to a website not in English, lets say the French version, the URL to the pages that have translations with them seem to have their URL changed to the English master page instead of the page in that language, in this case French. In the template, the URLs are set to be the French site, but for whatever reason it seems like it is being overridden by the master page in English. Is this just a HubSpot limitation since we arent fully using the translation feature, or is there a way around this?"
