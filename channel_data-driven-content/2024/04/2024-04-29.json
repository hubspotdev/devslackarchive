    "text": "Hi everyone, I'm new to HubDB and generating dynamic pages. What makes more sense and is better for the performance of the site? I have nested tables that should be generated as dynamic pages. For example: continents, countries and cities. Does it make sense to create a total of 3 tables and then add one Countries table as a subordinate table in the Continents table for each row.\n\nThe output of the countries per continent on the generated page should then be achieved by filtering. \"If continent A show only countries that belong to continent A\" (This would then have to be added as a foreign key in the country table?)?\n\nOr assign an extra countries table for each continent and then also create and assign a cities table?\n\nMy URl structure should be: /continents/countries/cities",
