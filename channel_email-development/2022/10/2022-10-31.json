    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI'd need clarification regarding HubSpot SMTP API.\nWe would like to send our transactional emails via SMTP.\nif we send an email via HubSpot marketing tools, will this be a different system sending the mail then when we send the mail via SMTP API?\nIf for the SMTP API mail we will have a different sending system then the HubSpot own system, are we going to have a different SMTP setup? e.g. our own abandoned cart mail can still be sent from a different system then the registration mail.\nThanks, any info is appreciated.",
