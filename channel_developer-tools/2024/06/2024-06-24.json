    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. We are seeking assistance with an issue that has arisen following our transition from using Hapikey (v2 version) to a Private App (v3 version) for our API calls. Since making this change, we have encountered a problem with tracking Google and Facebook leads in our HubSpot contacts list.\n\nPreviously, when we used a [specific code], tracking for contacts originating from Google functioned correctly for v2 version. However, after switching to v3 version, the tracking no longer seems to differentiate properly between Google and Facebook leads. Instead, [specific code] appears to aggregate contacts from both sources under a single filter in the HubSpot contacts list, particularly under the \"Original source drill-down 2\" filter option.\n\nCould you please help us resolve this issue so that we can correctly track and differentiate leads coming from Google and Facebook separately as we did before?\n\nYour prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance for your help and support."

Is there a way to make it embedded like HubSpot's data sync apps? Or if its a public app, making it outside HubSpot is the only option right now?",

Your app absolutely could sync data between HubSpot and another system but all the syncs page and settings would have to be in your app site I think.  Maybe someone smarter than me will chime in if there is a way."

Think of those configuration screens as very much built on and running inside HubSpot architecture...  we merely happened to have packaged them _*in the form*_ of an app which makes these sit along other developer apps.\n\nA field mapping table in the UX seems pretty innocent but it's a very intricate piece of software running on multiple backends, ultimately driving a data sync engine which sits deep in HubSpot.\n\nIt is our :compass: end goal to get data sync to evolve towards an open system which could expose something like a field mapping table to a developer.\n\nIn that regard I'm curious to hear what sits behind your ask....\n1. are you hoping you can equip your public app with a nice UX to layer on top of a data exchange mechanism that you've already built (or plan to) yourself through HubSpot's public APIs \n2. are you in fact looking for some sort of data sync SDK through which you could have an app behave exactly like a Shopify or Stripe app, which would include data sync mechanics, monitoring, and field mapping ux? \n"

It's just consistent UX for HubSpot customers, I believe. Similar to what Shopify has done with it's app ecosystem, where it lets you build \"embedded\" apps that match their UI/UX(with the help of its custom UI library - Polaris).\n\nI would want to do data sync etc through my app but with similar UI/UX to that of HubSpot's and preferably inside HubSpot app itself. I think it would be great for HubSpot ecosystem."
