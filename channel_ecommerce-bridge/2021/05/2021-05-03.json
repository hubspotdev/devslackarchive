Things are going great with our integration but I have a quick question that I would really appreciate if you could help with.\n\nWhen creating a product with a sync message like this\n```{\n \"storeId\": \"store_name\",\n \"objectType\": \"PRODUCT\",\n \"messages\": [\n {\n \"action\": \"UPSERT\",\n \"externalObjectId\": \"10184\",\n \"properties\": {\n \"price\": \"0\",\n \"product_name\": \"Awesome product\",\n \"product_description\": \"Awesome product description\",\n \"product_image_url\" : \"<https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssbckt01/images/image123.jpg>\";\n }\n }\n ]\n}```\nWhy is there no images displaying in the product catalog?",
