    "text": "Hello Everyone! I am having trouble with a jQuery hover event on submit buttons on HubSpot forms. On this simple test page....\n\n<https://www.novusagency.org/?hs_preview=QaIjmVIo-25064911123&amp;hsCacheBuster=812>\n\n....you will find a form and a paragraph of text. If you hover over the links in the paragraph, you should see the cursor fill in. I am attempting to do the same with the form submit button but nothing I do works. I also cannot recreate this problem outside of HubSpot. Here is the code I am using to try and accomplish this effect:\n\nJS\n```$(document).mousemove(function(e) {\n  $(\".pointer\").css({left:e.clientX, top:e.clientY});  \n});\n\n$(\"a, .hs-cta-wrapper, input[type='submit']\").hover(\n  function (){\n    $(\".pointer\").addClass(\"active\");\n  }, function (){     \n    $(\".pointer\").removeClass(\"active\");  \n});```\nCSS\n```body:hover .pointer {\n  position: fixed;\n  z-index: 9999999;\n  transform: translate(-43%, -43%);\n  width: 40px;\n  height: 40px;\n  background: rgba(23, 160, 91, 0);\n  border: 1.5px solid #17A05B;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  pointer-events: none;\n  transition: height 0.2s ease, width 0.2s ease, background 0.2s ease, border 0.2s ease;\n}\n\nbody:hover .pointer.active {\n  width: 60px;\n  height: 60px;\n  background: rgba(23, 160, 91, 0.5);\n  border: 0px solid #17A05B;\n  transition: height 0.2s ease, width 0.2s ease, background 0.2s ease, border 0.2s ease;\n}```\nHTML\n```&lt;!-- This is the green circle that follows the cursor --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pointer\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;```\nI have been working on this for hours with no success so any help you all can provide would be super appreciated!!"

    "text": "<@UDJMFTHAS> `window.load` may be dangerous because it waits for everything on the page to finish loading, including all resources. If your form is near the top, it could delay things or if a resource like an image or video is really large, you could miss that function entirely on slower connections, or at least be significantly delayed. To be safe, you can use this to run once your form is actually ready, regardless of whether the window is fully loaded.\n```window.addEventListener(\"message\", e=&gt;{\n  if (e.data.eventName === \"onFormReady\") {\n    // code goes here\n  }\n});```\nIt's an event that HS pops once the form is loaded. You can also call this inside of JS if you are loading forms that way, but I'm assuming you aren't. (here is a quick example of that: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/manipulating-forms-with-jquery>)."
