    "text": "Hey, I have a module where I have updated some of the fields to now be grouped. I am updating the JSON to use aliases_mapping, which I've used before, but it's not working. Here's the code:\n\n`\"aliases_mapping\" : {`\n   `\"property_aliases_paths\" : {`\n      `\"item_title\" : [ \"item_title\" ]`\n   `}`\n`}`\n\nThe \"item_title\" field name hasn't changed... only the structure and hierarchy of the fields. Previously, \"item_title\" was in a group already like \"parent_group\", so in the HTML it was parent_group.item_title. Now it is part of a new child group so it is parent_group.child_group.item_title. Everything works for a new module instance, but pre-existing instances of the module are not displaying the data from fields that were moved to the new child group.\n\nWhat am I missing??"

For example, if you have a style field \"module.styles.font_color.color\", you won't be able to use {{ module.styles.font_color.color }} in the CSS file. You have to load that in the HTML file using require_css and scope_css."
