    "text": "Sort of… the dream is to be able to link dev portals to a production portal so that it just uses content from the production portal in kind of a headless CMS fashion. Or at least to hit a button to sync the content. Neither of those are possible at this time. BUT, we did semi-successfully create a set of node scripts that use the API to essentially download content from one portal and upload it to another. It gets pretty hairy when you take into account all the other ‘dimensions’ (like authors, images/media, tags, cta’s, menus, etc) that have to be mapped from 1 portal to another."
