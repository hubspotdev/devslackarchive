    "text": "Hey guys! Is anyone familiar with migrating Shopify Data to HubSpot? I have found many diffuculties and we just synced the data though the shopify app directly in HubSpot. I can see spend per contact only if I click on it but there is column for it and nothing appears when I m trying to create a custom report. Revenue is not there as well.\nThese are the Objects that I have synced (image 1) and under contacts here is the mapping (image 2). I would expect to have \"Amount Spent\" per contact is there is a column in Shopify under the contact section. What about Revenue? Should that be under orders?",
