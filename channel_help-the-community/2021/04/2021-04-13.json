Having a bit of an issue with website scalability... when devices (not browsers) are zoomed to 150% (apparently the 'recommended' amount by windows?!) all the text just goes off the page, yet when the display/window resolution changes the text is dynamically moved and even changes size when it gets down the the mobile resolutions.. Has anyone else had this problem?"
