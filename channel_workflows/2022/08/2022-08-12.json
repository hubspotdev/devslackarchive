    "text": "I am sorry if this question isn’t technical enough, but I am struggling with it so hard that I’m hoping there’s someone who can help me out.\n\nI am trying to build a company-based workflow that triggers when a specific meeting is booked. This meeting shows up as an activity on the company record, so this is relatively easy.\n\nFrom there, I would like to inform 6 external partners that we have received a new lead (this specific meeting is a demo booking). I was thinking I can just send an internal marketing email, but this only works for contact-based workflows and I cannot use that because one meeting might be booked with 2+ contacts from the same company, and then I don’t want to send out the same company as a new lead multiple times.\n\nIs there anybody with a good idea on how to inform external partners in the described situation?",
