And, they can set everything as you specified: padding - bg-color - text color - border width - border color. Then the same for hover states.\n\nIn modules that use buttons I always include a “Button type” option that allows the user to select those 3 variants.\n\nBut for consistency sake — the settings for the styles are housed in Theme settings. My button module typically also includes a “Custom” option where the user can define a custom button in the module itself as well."

Open them up and you have the same button interface for all of them. We have never run into any issues with it being confusing. It’s really a trade off between customization and complexity.
