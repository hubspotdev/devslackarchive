    "text": "Hello I have one big question to the HubSpot devs here:\nSome years ago I create a portal to test new things and with the past of the time I converted in our main dev portal to do everything. Now we want to use it to sell our modules from there and to test email modules (this portal have not that feature) or custom quote development (we are using our partner portal to do it and later translate it to the client one) well… my main question is if there is a way to convert that second “just test” portal to a marketplace developer portal so we can test, and sell, everything from there?"
