When I’m creating a new website page I’m able to select the template from a recently uploaded new theme, but when it comes to updating a template on an already existing page, even though I see my theme, there’s no template to select. Have you ever met an issue like that?\n\nFor the record, this is at the top of my template:\n```&lt;!--\n  templateType: page\n  isAvailableForNewContent: true\n  screenshotPath: ../images/templates/homepage.jpg\n  label: Homepage\n--&gt;```"
