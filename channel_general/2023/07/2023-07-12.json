Here's the scenario:\n\nWe needed to automatically sync the contacts from Wix contact form to HubSpot.\n\nI added the tracking code of HubSpot in the Wix custom code. So it is now working. The problem is, when I submit a contact in the contact form, it will be stored in HubSpot automatically which is what we want. But when I will try to submit another contact in the contact form, the previous one will be removed and the new one will be stored.\n\nI read an article that it  overrides the previous contact if they are from the same IP address or network connection, resulting in the removal of the previous entry. And it's a cookie issue. There is also an article here to address the issue of override: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/events/cookie-banner?_ga=2.185462825.141617532.1689222626-1167094308.1689222626>\n\nso that even with the same IP or browser, it won't override.\n\nCan somebody help me how to add the code in Wix? or should I add this in HubSpot? Apologies but I am not a developer but I can understand if someone can teach me how.\n\nThanks in advance!",
