Example:  `\"hierarchical\": false,` it doesn’t appear to be related to groups, so it’s kind of a mystery what it means.\n\nanother related item would be documentation for how to view more descript errors when updating modules/files via FTP.\n\nalso it’d be cool to have a section of “FTP file not updating troubleshooting tips” or something. To point out things to look for in your file to figure out why it’s not working\n\n<@U6W3H6YN8>"

    "text": "Hi guys, wondering if anyone could advise me on my next steps here:\n```\n&lt;!-- Set the filter by search bar, and submit button --&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;form id=\"form_id\" method=\"get\"&gt;\n    \n    &lt;!-- Search field --&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;input name=\"listing_address\" type=\"text\" id=\"search-by\" class=\"autocomplete\" placeholder=\"Search by City or Zip Code...\"&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;input id=\"submit-button\" type=\"submit\" value=\"search\"&gt;\n    \n  &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Set the different query parameters using submitted input for hubdb query --&gt;\n{% set queryparam = \"\" %}\n{% if request.query_dict.type == \"show-all\" and request.query_dict.listing_address != \"\" %}\n  {% set queryparam = \"listing_address__icontains=\"~request.query_dict.listing_address|urlencode %}\n{% endif %}\n```\n\nIn the above code, I've removed the filter functionality from the Real Estate Tutorial example so it leaves me with this.\nI'm running into three issues here:\n1. The search is returning the same results that's being displayed by default\n2. The functionality in the `if` statement is looking for the `show-all` in order to work\n3. Removing the `request.query_dict.type == \"show-all\" and` part returns an error in the HubL console\n\nI can get this working by having the select box in the code and hiding in CSS, but this is hacky, messy and unneccessary. Any advice on how I can get round this?\n\nHappy Holidays :christmas_tree: :snowman: :gift:"
