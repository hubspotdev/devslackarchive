    "text": "Hi everyone, we want to map the management of the newsletter subscription status (opt-in/opt-out) in our system and then set the status via API for the contact in HubSpot. Our developers are currently evaluating the API and have come across the following sentence:\n “The subscribe contact endpoint allows you to subscribe an email address to any given subscription type in an account, but will *not allow you to resubscribe contacts who have opted out.*” (Siehe <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/marketing-api/subscriptions-preferences>)\nIs it right that if a customer opts out of a list in our system and we set the subscription type to opt-out on the HS side via API, that a re-subscribe via our system that sets the re-subscribe via API on the HS side for the contact and subscription type is not possible? If so, is someone aware of possible alternative approaches?\nThanks a lot for your help in advance!",
