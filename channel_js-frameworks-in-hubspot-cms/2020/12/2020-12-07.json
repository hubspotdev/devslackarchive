    "text": "hello @channel\nI’m using the `HubSpot/cms-react-boilerplate` as a base for our new HS module. everything worked fine so far, except when I tried using some package - in this case `antd` <https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design> (React components library)\n\nWhen I import some of the library components, I get these kind of errors in the CLI, while using watcher:\n• Badge: `[HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin] line 927: Error parsing 'backgroundColor: '#fff', color: '#999', borderColor: '#d9d9d9'': syntax error at position 46, encountered ':', expected '}'`\n• Table: `[HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin] line 7823: Error parsing 'width: '100%'': syntax error at position 166, encountered ':', expected '}'`\n• … \nSo far I saw only this kind of parsing errors (looks like it’s always about the `style` properties), is this something that can be fixed with the Webpack configuration or is it some bigger problem?\nThanks for any input!"
