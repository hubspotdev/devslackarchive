    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe've setup a live chat widget to our website and we want track people (in GA4) who are trying to contact us there using GTM and will send events to our GA4 accounts.\n\nWe're able to work this out and track people who started a chat with us using this event *conversationStarted*, however, we also want to track people who submitted an email so we can validate if the chat is legit (not spam). We've tried to use *contactAssociated* event but it seems it's not working.\n\nCan you help us achieve this? I'm not sure which channel but i think <#C2YHAHB6K|api> <#CBA9UA4EN|javascript> will work? If not, please correct me. Thanks\n\nhere's our code that we use to track these events:\n\n```&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n  function onConversationsAPIReady() {\n    //console.log(\"HubSpot Conversations API Available\");\n    window.HubSpotConversations.on( 'conversationStarted', function( payload ) {\n    //console.log(\"HubSpot Conversation Started\");\n      window.dataLayer.push({\n        'event': 'hs_conversation_started',\n        'hs-conversation-id': payload.conversation.conversationId\n      })\n    });\n    \n    window.HubSpotConversations.on( 'contactAssociated', function( payload ) {\n      window.dataLayer.push({\n        'event': 'hs_contact_associated',\n        'hs-conversation-id': payload.conversation.conversationId\n      })\n    });\n  }\n  /*\n   If external API methods are already available, use them.\n  */\n  if (window.HubSpotConversations) {\n    onConversationsAPIReady();\n  } else {\n    /*\n      Otherwise, callbacks can be added to the hsConversationsOnReady on the window object.\n      These callbacks will be called once the external API has been initialized.\n    */\n    window.hsConversationsOnReady = [onConversationsAPIReady];\n  }\n &lt;/script&gt;```\n"
