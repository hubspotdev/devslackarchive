    "text": "Hey all,\n\nA few weeks ago <@U087GKEQWMC> complained about not being able to easily find internal values for default HubSpot properties, and I completely agree with that. So I put together a simple page that has all the default properties for contacts, companies, deals and tickets. You can see the name, internal name, type and description. Also you can copy the internal names because that is what we need in most cases.\n\nLet me know if I should add anything else that can be useful or if anything is missing/wrong.\n\n<https://hs-default-properties.replit.app/>",
