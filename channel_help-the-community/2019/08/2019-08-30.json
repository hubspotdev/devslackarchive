    "text": "Hi everyone! I have a question regarding the meeting schedule module in HubSpot. Id like to create a meeting scheduler for a team. Each team member will be available independently for the given time slots. The “Round Robin Availability” offers this functionality (as far as I understood). However, if I create the scheduler and book a meeting, the meeting at this time will be blocked for all team members. Is there a way, such that the meetings can be scheduled for each team member in the team meeting scheduler?"
