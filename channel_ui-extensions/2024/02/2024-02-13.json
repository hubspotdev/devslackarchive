    "text": "Hey everyone! Would there be any specific reason why the local dev server wouldn’t work? I followed the instructions from the quickstart docs and I used the CLI to create the UI Extension example. The extension works fine and the local dev server starts and works fine in the terminal but the browser window doesn’t update with the local dev extension (it’s showing the production version). I’m testing on a live portal, not in a sandbox and I have the latest CLI version. If I go to `<http://localhost:8080/servers/ui-extensions-dev-server>` I get see this {“port”: 5173}.",
