    "text": "Thanks, <@U6W3H6YN8>. Did remove it and it works. Get confused becuse it complains about not being able to upload the source map files. (Would like them during development)\n\nWe would also like to remove though, but the main template folder was originally named including an Ã¸, and remove will have none of that. (Bad request). Think there's too many references to the folder to attempt a rename.\nIf I could be pointed to the right source file I could possibly debug and PR a fix for intl. chars?"
