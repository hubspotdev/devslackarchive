This causes all the module data to go for each blog article. We need to then replace all the content, which is fine..\n\nI just don't want to change the template and suddenly all the articles have no content whilst being live until I put all the content back in.\n\nanyone got a good method of keeping all the old stuff live until we're ready with the new stuff?\n\nThe only solution I have so far is to create a new blog and then redirect everything"
