    "text": "Hello everyone. I have built a custom product module that has multiple additions per page. It has a tabbed section with JavaScript. If I add the module in multiple places in the page, the top tabs work but the bottom tabs don't. I think it's an issue with not having a unique ID for the tabbed section (\"ID attribute values must be unique\"). Any ideas on how to give that section a unique ID? Perhaps pull in the HubSpot module number into the id or html?",

One way to get around this is by refactoring the JS code into a `require_js` block within the HTML window and referencing the `name` variable, which is unique for each module instance. "
