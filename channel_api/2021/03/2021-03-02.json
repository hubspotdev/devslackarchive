    "text": "Hi everyone! I just joined this awesome community to ask you for help in regards to the HubSpot API.\nMy task is to create integration with HS for translating the content. I'm a bit stuck with translating a blog post. I've created a blog and added it to a multi-language group. I've defined few languages there. Next, I created a blog post in the source language. Then using the UI I've added a translation to one of the languages.\nNow I want to do the same but with using the API.\nI'm at the stage where I already have the content translated and now I just need to send it back to HubSpot. I tried the following method: Check if translation already exists. In case it doesn't exist, `clone` the blog post and `update` it with `translated_from_id` field. Then `update` it with the `language` property set to the translation language and the actual content.\nIt's not working, though.\nOur integration is written in PHP and we're using HubSpot client library 2.x, so it corresponds to the v2 of the API (it's an inherited solution and we have it in the backlog to upgrade to v3). I can post you some code snippets or JSON data if that would make it easier to understand what I'm doing.",
