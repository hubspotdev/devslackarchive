It's really hard to create a row when the section creates the columns for you, even cloning doesn't always trigger a row. It's hard to style a row if you can't see it, so it makes sense if the section was developed with rows and columns that you would then be able to find the controls.\n\nTechnically even single modules have a row associated with them. But we only ever show a row toolbar if:\nThere is more than one column in it\nThe row has some sort of styling applied"
