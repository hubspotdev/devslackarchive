    "text": "Hey guys, thought i’d throw this in here in case anybody had ideas, but getting stuck on something I’m trying with a slack app im building. I have this data, sorted by the day of the year that something happened (1 - 366), and I want to split up the data into separate arrays based on that value. So for example, this data:\n\n```[\n  { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:23', time: 123, day_of_year: 218 },\n  { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:45', time: 145, day_of_year: 218 },\n  { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '2:43', time: 243, day_of_year: 218 },\n  { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:12', time: 112, day_of_year: 218 },\n  { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: ':56', time: 56, day_of_year: 218 },\n  { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:41', time: 141, day_of_year: 219 },\n  { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:20fasd\\\\', time: 120, day_of_year: 219 },\n  { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:10', time: 110, day_of_year: 219 },\n  { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:12', time: 112, day_of_year: 220 },\n  { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: ':20', time: 20, day_of_year: 220 }\n] ```\n\nwould end up like this:\n\n```[\n  [\n    { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:23', time: 123, day_of_year: 218 },\n    { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:45', time: 145, day_of_year: 218 },\n    { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '2:43', time: 243, day_of_year: 218 },\n    { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:12', time: 112, day_of_year: 218 },\n    { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: ':56', time: 56, day_of_year: 218 }\n  ],\n  [\n    { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:41', time: 141, day_of_year: 219 },\n    { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:20fasd\\\\', time: 120, day_of_year: 219 },\n    { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:10', time: 110, day_of_year: 219 },\n  ],\n  [\n    { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: '1:12', time: 112, day_of_year: 220 },\n    { id: 'UL3U3EUPQ', text: ':20', time: 20, day_of_year: 220 }\n  ]\n]```\n\nAny ideas?"
