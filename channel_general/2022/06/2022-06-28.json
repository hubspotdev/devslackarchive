I absolutely “hate” the whole developer experience so I have two questions.\n\nIs it actually possible to use React and have the same functionalities like when developing everything in HubSpot? So the drag n drop and modules etc?\n\nAre there any good resources for setting up the whole local dev environment to make things easier? Or any online courses?",

It's worth noting that a public app does not mean it's listed in our marketplace or anything like that. It does mean that you need to support the OAuth 2.0 flow and refresh tokens every 30 minutes.  You can set up a public app from a developer account"
