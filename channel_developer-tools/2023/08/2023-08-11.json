I'm trying to pass a custom shipping fee that is in my deal information to a quote, in the custom template, I can read the value throught the template_data object, I can manually add that value to the quote amount, but only to show it in the quote's page, when I check the amount in the quotes list, the value is not added. Is there any way to achieve this feature?",
