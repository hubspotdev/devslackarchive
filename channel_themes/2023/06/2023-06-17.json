    "text": "Hello,\nI've seen some changes in the latest theme validation. I get this error now and we cannot update the theme to a fix release.\n\n `[ERROR] Theme fields needs to include 4 additional standard field names. Please add [body_font, heading_font, secondary_color, primary_color].`\n\nWe have all these settings in the fields.json file but with similar names. Changes like these have a lot of effort and i don't know what a migration path could be without breaking the existing installations. These settings can also be available in a dropdown in many theme modules.\n\nI believe this is a bit too much for older themes, specially not to be able to upload any fix release before fixing all new requirements first.\n\nCould you suggest how to handle such changes.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nThanasis",
