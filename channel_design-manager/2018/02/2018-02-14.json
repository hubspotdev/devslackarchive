Then when it loads in a template it shows the topic slug but you cant get the actual label value. I mean you can use the `replace()` filter but if you have a value name like `one-time deals` you'd be stripping that `-` out as well.  \n\nIs there a way to get the label added to the JSON info that is spit out with the Tag Module.",
