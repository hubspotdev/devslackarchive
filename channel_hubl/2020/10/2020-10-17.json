    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am trying to design a blog template that we will use for at least two different blogs within one account. I am trying to figure out a way to get the current blog id on the template for pagination purposes. I know how to manually get the blog ids but as we want to use the same temp for different blogs, I need to get the associated blog id on the template via hubl or something.\n\nThanks in advance.",
