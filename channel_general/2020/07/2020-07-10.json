You can then update the Primary Domain to the new domain and that will make the switch automatically. The system will automatically create redirects for you.  If you create the pages outside of Content Staging and manually set the domain to one of the hs-sites domains on the page level, there is no way to change that domain in bulk.  That was the way I originally interpreted your question.  If you build in Content Staging, push to original domain, let it update, then replace primary with the new domain and leave the original domain redirecting to the new primary you will be fine.  A flexible URL mapping using the {rest-of-url} parameter will ensure the old pages are redirected to the new ones."
