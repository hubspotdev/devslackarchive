    "text": "Hi All, I’m looking to add some additional form functionalities on the page level to conditionally show/hide form fields (and related dropdown values) based  on user input field value selection. Due to HS form conditional field visibility rules limitations, I’d exploring options to call an endpoint to partially update a form (or make some other rule on the template/page level) This was relatively easy in another MAP I’ve used in the past but not so much in HubSpot it seems. Is it even possible?\nI’m not a developer so I hope my question was clear :sweat_smile: I would appreciate any advice from all you dev gurus out there.\nThanks for reading!",
