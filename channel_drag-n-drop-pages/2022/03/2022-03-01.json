Meaning that I could link the module as if I were on a template like so `{% module 'title' path='../modules/header.module' %}`\n\nI’ve been trying to scape from the dnd areas and sections because it makes everything easier for devs, but in this case I don’t know if there’s a workaround to avoid this. Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:"
