Why would you want to cause a mobile user to reload a page (depending on connection, that could take more time then the person wants) when you can have 9 perfectly good blog posts for them to look through..\n\nBesides it messing up pagination and needing you to write extra code to bring in those posts, or hide them, why... it just doesn't make sense when every other blog has 9+ blog posts on a listing page. That is what people are used to. They don't want to click to the second page for 3 more items..."

Often times a client wants to do something for a good reason, but they aren't communicating it properly. Hell, we all have that problem. A lot of the times I'm answering a question that someone else asked -- and I'm not answering what they are trying to ask.\n\nIt is good to \"hear\" or \"listen\" to a client before going into these types of things. MAke sure they feel heard, and then present what you think to be the right information as to why they shouldn't. AND IN THE CASE they do have a really good reason or some analytics or some kind of idea as to why you should do it -- maybe just say let me do a little more research and then figure out if it is really a good idea."
