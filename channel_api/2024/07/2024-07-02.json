    "text": "Hi,\n\nI am working with a client would like to confirm the following are possible through the API before we start the project, should be fairly simple!\n\n1. We have some custom objects (e.g. Organisations), which has its own fields. We need to be able to read some of those properties. Can you confirm we would need to call /crm/v3/objects/{objectType}/{objectId}, which would return a json with a properties field, which would contain the custom field field?\n\n2. Similarly, they have some custom fields on a Contact. Can you confirm we can retrieve these from /crm/v3/objects/contacts/{contactId}}, which would return a json with a properties field, which would contain the list of custom properties?\n\n3. We also need to be able to see which contacts are in which organisation (via associations). Can you confirm we can view these in the responses from the above questions? I.e. we can see the associated contacts from the organisation, and we can see the associated organisation from the contact.\n\n4. We have member registration on the CMS, we want to use a private app so the users can use that same login for a different backend. Is that possible?",

That means you have to do work in testing to determine what the issue is, I can’t magically answer this.\n\nPart of being a developer is understanding all the various ways someone can come to your page and move through the flow of what you are asking them to.\n\nDo you have a cookie banner? Are they saying no? Are they clearing out UTM data? Are they manually coming back to the page 12 hours later from their phone instead of their computer? You have to test these situations out and try to replicate the issue. Once you have the issue replicated, then you can solve for it.\n\nAll you have said is that it doesn’t work for some contacts. You have to dig deeper into what the issue is if you want to solve it.\n\nThe best way to connect a contact with their HubSpot cookie is to send contact information and their HubSpot cookie to the forms api. Look into that, that might help.\n\nAs for why you don’t have UTM SOURCE for deal creation via the api, I can’t determine this. You haven’t given me enough information to go off of. Have you determined if the api update is failing/404? Sorry — You gotta do some of the work here if you want someone to help."
