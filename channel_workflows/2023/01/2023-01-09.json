    "text": ":wave: I'm seeing something that looks like a race condition with two of my workflows:\n• wf1: enrolls all tickets with status `Initial`, and updates the Ticket name to `foo` ; does not re-enroll\n• wf2: enrolls all tickets and updates their status, calculated from other props.\nNine out of ten times, this does what I expect — new tickets are renamed to `foo` and their status is calculated according to the branches in wf2. However, tickets occasionally are not renamed and do not enroll in wf1. I can see how this might happen, if wf2 \"quickly\" updates the status from `Initial` to something else, and wf1 doesn't notice the ticket *did* briefly meet his enrollment criteria.\n\nBut it's a little concerning to me that it's possible for a ticket to meet the enrollment criteria of a workflow (however briefly) and not be enrolled.",
