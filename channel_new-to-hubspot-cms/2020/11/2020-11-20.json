I have a lot of experience with Wordpress/Jekyll/Gatsby so I'm hoping it won't be too difficult to adapt. If anyone has any resources for working locally with tools like gulp/sass that would greatly be appreciated. I'm also really curious about creating some sort of development/staging environment if possible. Thanks ahead of time.",
