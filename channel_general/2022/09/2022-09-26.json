Because there are so many, those subscriptions are grouped and thats why they are grouped into multiple checkboxes - which was not the best idea apparently.\nWhen the user enters the form, the selection for this user is preloaded, and the user is free to change whatever. Now the non-standard behavior kicks in: HubSpot will only transfer additional selections to the CRM. Deselecting any of the preloaded options is not stored."

While customers have had access to a commenting feature in Marketing Hub and CMS Hub for a while, the feature hasn't been as deeply integrated into overall work flow for customers as much as we'd like. With this release, we're excited to bring the newest version of the embedded Collaboration Sidebar updates to the CMS editors, a place where collaboration is critical to ensuring you put your best foot forward on your website and blog.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nNext time a customer enters the landing pages, website pages or blog post editors, they'll see the Collaboration Sidebar available across each screen of the editor. This includes three tools, Commenting, Marketing Tasks and Marketing Calendar:"
