    "text": "[Resolved]Hi all,\n\nI am getting an error when hitting the files endpoint for a file ID returned from a file property of my deal. Does anyone know how to get past this?\n\n• I have a file property for my deals for POs to be uploaded manually in the UI by our sales team\n• When I use the API to return the deal, I get what looks like a file id:\n• `\"customer_po_file\": \"1710803354XX\",`\n•  However, I can't find this file in the Libraries -> Files manually in the UI, and when I try the endpoint : `\"<https://api.hubapi.com/files/v3/files/1710803354XX>\"`  I get a 404 error\n• I am hoping to get a URL we can use to upload the file programmatically to our fulfillment/accounting software\nDoes anyone know how to access file property files via the API? Thank you!",
