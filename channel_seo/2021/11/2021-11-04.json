    "text": "Hey everyone - i recently realized that we can't add a rel=\"nofollow\" to a link used in a HubSpot-generated CTA (that is, when you create a CTA using the CTA tool of HubSpot - there is no way to make the link in that cta rel=\"nofollow\" if you need to). I just posted the idea in the forum: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Option-to-add-a-rel-quot-nofollow-quot-to-the-links-used-in/idi-p/521236#M96517> - if you guys want to upvote it so HubSpot notices it. I would think most of us use these CTAs to link to a landing page (LP) that is by default no-indexed by HubSpot. Therefore we don't want to send any link equity to these LPs for seo purposes. Having the option to nofollow theses CTA links should be available to us. Have you encountered that issue before? Did you find a workaround? Thanks so much!",
