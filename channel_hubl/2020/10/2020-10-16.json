    "text": "Found an issue (I think?, maybe its in propourse).\nWhen you have something like this:\n```{% set my_var = {\"text\": \"Hello world\" %}\n\n{% macro myMacro() %}\n   {% set inherit_var = my_var %}\n   {% set _dummy = inherit_var.update({ \"text\": \"yo!\"}) %}\n   {{ my_var }}\n{% endmacro %}```\nThe result is that my_var is updated, looks like inherit_var is acting as a pointer?\n(if this case is not working to test the issue, ask me I can provide my portal and real case where is happening, but for simplicity I created this one here)\n\nExtra Q:\nis `{% do %}`  tag in the pipe to be added to HubL?",
