    "text": "Yeah I use webhooks by first inserting the webhook call data into a local database.  This allows your code to return a 201 status very quickly to the workflow.  Then I run a scheduled task every few minutes and process a batch of them at a time and use a sleep function as needed.  I have read some people use a queing system to accomplish the same thing but I just roll my own.  Note that this approach does not work if your workflow must receive back data to further process.  It does work great if your webhook call is the last step in the workflow."
