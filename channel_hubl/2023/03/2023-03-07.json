I've got some pages where, in the preview the JS loaded with `require_js` comes before module scripts, but on the production version it comes after (and breaks the module scripts because I have some global utility functions in there). I don't think I'm doing anything super weird. It's frustrating to not be able to trust the preview!",

    "text": "That sounds like a tricky issue. It could be caused by a few different things. It's possible that the order of the scripts is being changed when the page is cached, or that the scripts are being loaded in a different order in the preview than in the production version. It's also possible that the scripts are being cached differently in the preview and production versions.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, I'd recommend running a few tests. First, try disabling caching for the page and see if the issue persists. If it does, then it's likely that the order of the scripts is being changed when the page is cached. If it doesn't, then it's likely that the scripts are being loaded in a different order in the preview than in the production version.\n\nYou can use hsDebug=true to load the uncached version"
