    "text": "Hi everyone. We are using the HubSpot plugin for WordPress to display the forms that the user can fill, but we are repeatedly facing an issue after submitting: RequestHeaderSectionTooLarge \"Your request header section exceeds the maximum allowed size\". Unfortunately we don't have access to server configuration, so my question is: Is there a way to hook onto the form submission and get access to the data? Basically a way to reduce the data passed to HubSpot."
