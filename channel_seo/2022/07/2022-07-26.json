    "text": "Hello everyone. My blog pagination is getting dinged as duplicate content. Has anyone come up with a good mechanism that allows us to set specific title tags and meta tags for each blog listing page (…/blog/page/1, …/blog/page/2, etc) ? I know we CAN set a canonical URL to the first blog listing page which would eliminate the duplicate content flag, but this also prevents Google and other search engines from finding the subsequent listing pages and potentially limiting the exposure of the content on those pages. Thanks!"
