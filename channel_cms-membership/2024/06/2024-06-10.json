    "text": "Hi all, just realised HubSpot migrated from lists to ‘access groups’ for private content.. I had a page built with some content based on the list the user was in, I used the variable `list_membership`  and compared it with the page `public_access_rules`  ids, now i don’t have any record of the new ‘access groups’ in my user variable.. any thoughts?"
