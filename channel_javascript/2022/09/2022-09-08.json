    "text": "If you are trying to write clean code, this isn’t easily readable, so I’d stray from being that clever in a project that is production or client related. I’d write code like this if I were doing something personal.\n\nthe entire purpose of clean code and how that works is very anti what you are doing here, so I know you are a very competent programmer, but I want to make sure that other people aren’t writing like this in a vanilla javascript way, if this were to get searched on.\n\n```const title = 'this is a title'\nconst description = 'this is description'\n\nconst markup = (dialogObject) =&gt; {\n  console.log(dialogObject)\n  let html = '&lt;div class=\"dialog__header-inner\"&gt;'\n  if(dialogObject.title) html += `&lt;div class=\"dialog__heading h5\"&gt;${dialogObject.title}&lt;/div&gt;`\n  if(dialogObject.description) html += `&lt;p class=\"dialog__description\"&gt;${dialogObject.description}&lt;/p&gt;`\n  return `${html}&lt;/div&gt;`\n}\n\nmarkup({title,description})```\nthis is likely the most I would factor this down —\n\nI’d likely be a bit more verbose for production that would have a function for each of the div and for the paragraph.\n\nI also might build helper functions that I would send classes and tag names as well as the content — but overall I’d stay away from this in production because this is too clever imo"
