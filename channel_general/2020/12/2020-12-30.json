    "text": "<@U7SL518D6> I decided to use the solution <@U3T21PDBK> shared (`.pipe(replace(/(hubl\\(\")(.*?)(\"\\))/g, '{{ $2 }}'))`).\n\nThis way, I can combine the theme settings with sass. I have a bunch of files in a `settings` folder which I use to define all colors, fonts, shadows, radius etc. The `_colors.scss` file then contains variables set like this: `$primary-color: hubl('theme.global_colors.primary_color.color');`\nI then compile and minify my main.scss to a main.css file which is synced to HubSpot. This works great with sass variables and the theme settings.\n\nStill working on <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C22PU4LV8/p1609234287304900|this> tho."
