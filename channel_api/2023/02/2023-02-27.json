This is where you would add your viewer.js file (these could also be loaded in the footer or elsewhere on the page, but not important to this discussion)\n\nThe second header is more about the <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers|HTTP Headers> on a page. These have request and response headers as well as a whole bunch of other items. These aren’t managed inside HubSpot and are more like “server” items vs webpage items. HubSpot locks most of this down unless you have CMS Enterprise, then you have some options, but overall companies like HubSpot and other platforms. (google drive, box, etc), you don’t have access to these items. They keep their security tight.\n\nI hope that makes a bit more sense. That being said, if you are looking at getting those box files over to your HubSpot account, I’d look to see if zapier will get them copied over, or some other integration, or you would need some custom code to make that work, using a off site server to access this data."

    "text": "Hi there, I am testing the Imports API for use in an integration. The integration needs to create and update contacts as well as custom objects (and the associations between those records) from a single .csv file. Everything works as I expect when the import is run manually/through the regular UI in HubSpot. But when I attempt the exact same steps with the Imports API, I am seeing different behavior and errors.\n\nMy test is broken into two steps:\n*Step 1:* Run an import with a single row of data representing multiple associated objects. The row contains a contact record and two custom objects (Policy and Party). This is the entire .csv file:\n```email, policy_id, party_id\n<mailto:dave@fakemail.com|dave@fakemail.com>, 123, 456 ```\n*Step 2:* Run another import with a second single row of data that is identical to the first, except that the email address for the contact is different:\n```email, policy_id, party_id\n<mailto:erik@fakemail.com|erik@fakemail.com>, 123, 456```\nThe expected outcome is that the Policy with ID 123 will be updated to have a new associated contact (<mailto:erik@fakemail.com|erik@fakemail.com>) instead of <mailto:dave@fakemail.com|dave@fakemail.com>, and the same should happen for the Party with ID 456. This is exactly what happens when I run two subsequent Imports through the regular Import UI/feature of HubSpot.\n\nWhen I attempt this through the Imports API, however, I get an error on the second import attempt, and nothing gets updated (the Policy and Party objects do not get assigned a new associated contact). The error says \"Duplicate Unique Property Value\". Is there some additional field/flag I need to add in my importRequest object that gets sent when initiating the import via the API? Thank you!",
