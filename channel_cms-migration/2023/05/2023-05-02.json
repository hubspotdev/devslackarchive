Pages can be exported as HTML, but page builds with the DND and theme attached cannot be moved over (though the theme and theme settings themselves can be moved)\n\ntherefore cms migrations from portal to portal are rather nuanced because there isn't a native way to move the content/pages itself. Objects, shouldn't be an issue."
