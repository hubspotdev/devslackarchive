    "text": "Hey <@U06BTMDLUQN> - afaik it's currently not possible to edit the KB templates on the same level as pages/blogs...\n\nYou could try to create some sort of overengineered solution by replacing the current nav with your own one by writing some JS in the Header HTML area (Settings -Content -&gt; KB -&gt; Template), but I'd advise against to do so.\nFrom my experience, creating a custom blog template which looks/works like a KB is the easiest solution currently available since it will give you much more functionality than the current KB possibilities"
