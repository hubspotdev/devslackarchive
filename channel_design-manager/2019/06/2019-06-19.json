    "text": "There isn’t a way to add additional module types to categories. I would suggest either\n- Using a prefix for each module so that the customer can easily filter by searching for the prefix. For example, you could title a module `Client 2019 - Image gallery`, `Client 2019 - Testimonial` and the client could filter the modules by simply searching `Client 2019`.\n- Modules can be added to a template from the left sidebar as well as the ‘+ Add’ section of the right sidebar. If you group all of your modules into a folder (or subfolders) you can instruct your customer on how to navigate the left sidebar, locate the module folder(s) and add them from there."
