It has come to my attention that HubSpot will soon be releasing a changelog regarding the enforcement of property validation rules on July 24th. In light of this, I was wondering if there exists an API that can provide information on the rules and validations applicable to object properties.\nIf such an API exists, it would undoubtedly be a game-changer for other platforms whose customers rely on HubSpot integrations. Your insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated.",
