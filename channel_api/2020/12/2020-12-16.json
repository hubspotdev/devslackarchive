I am trying to track when a deal enters and exits each stage.  However, I am having a hard time understanding how the datetime for each enter/exit field is recorded.  When I move a field to a new stage, I can see that the date time for that stage enter field is now there, but when I move it out of that stage, that field is now reset back to null, and no exit time is ever recorded.\n\nIs there a specific amount of time a deal has to sit in a stage  before the  enter/exit date will be recorded?",
