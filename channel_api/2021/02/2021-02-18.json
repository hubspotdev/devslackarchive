    "text": "Hi <@UFBNA9K9A>,  we are trying to pull data about sales quotes from HubSpot with our connector but we noticed that there's a problem preventing this. The problem is that the CRM API currently only supports retrieving quotes that have been created by a HubSpot user in a HubSpot account via an API key. And that is not viable option for us. We would need the support for OAuth authorization. Do you know when support for OAuth authorization would be available or if there's any workaround that we could try in the meantime?"

Perhaps with a solution such as iframe? Mapping field to field with timeline activities doesn't seem like the right way to go?\n(The CRM is MS Dynamics 365)\nThanks!",

Went through the HubSpot documentation but couldn't follow well.
