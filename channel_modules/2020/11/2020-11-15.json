You cannot access the variable outside of it, so if you plan to use _type_list_ after the loop, i would recommend creating an empty array then joining it after:\n\n```{% set type_list = [] %}\n{% for choice in types %}\n{% set tmp =  type_list.append(choice.id)  %}\n{% endfor %}```\nThis will allow you to access the updated type_list array outside of the loop"
