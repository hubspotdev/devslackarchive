    "text": "Hey everyone - <http://drafter.ai|Drafter AI> is making a new tool (that already works, but we're cleaning and refining it) which generates perfect custom code actions for HubSpot (e.g. workflows) based on natural language (e.g. \"make a code that takes a contact and does xyz\"). I'm manually processing a few hundred pages of documentation pulled from the api documentation webpages. Does anyone have a clean download of the entire API and CMS documentation that could save me a few hundred hours of time?\n\n:bulb: *Feel free to @ anyone at HubSpot who might be able to help!* :bulb:\n\n• The first tool generates custom code actions from natural language\n• The second debugs custom code actions for a given code and execution log\n• The third (in progress) will convert custom code actions into custom workflow actions ready to put on the marketplace\nCUSTOM CODE ACTION AND CUSTOM WORKFLOW ACTION EXAMPLES ARE ALSO VERY HELPFUL"
