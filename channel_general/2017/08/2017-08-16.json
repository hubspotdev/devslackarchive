    "text": "Hi everyone! specially to <@U25PYL3Q8> <@U2H3TT8F2> for your help with the slider on HubSpot last week. Finally I have received an answer from HubSpot Support. They said that there is a bug on IOS which is responsible for this problem with the slider. There´s  a bug reported since 2014 and IOS hasn´t been resolved yet. Here´s the link  <https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/bootstrap-carousel-white-space-issue/257067/5>\nAnyway Thanks for your help again. I really appreciate it."
