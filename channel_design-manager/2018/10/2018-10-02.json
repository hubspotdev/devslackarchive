And yeah the purpose of the toggle is that if you no longer want the module added to templates you can toggle it off (soon it'll also prevent the module from being added to pages or in the content editors but we had to fix some stuff around that first). We use that feature for when you clone modules that may have publish-blocking validation errors, so that way you cannot add it to a template or publish it until you fix the errors."
