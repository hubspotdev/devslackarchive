    "text": "We have a client that is looking to pull in \"availability\" data into a HubSpot website for vacation tours from SAP via an API call. The availability data we would like to display to users would need to be requested via API and hosted on either the HubDB or on a 3rd party database such as Amazon Web Services. Based on the technical limitations (<https://legal.HubSpot.com/HubSpot-product-and-services-catalog>) it looks like we are limited to 200 requests per every 10-seconds. On a page such as this: <https://www.easytravel.co.tz/tanzania-tours/romance-and-honeymoon>, where a single user could be loading upwards of 10 tours or more simultaneously within 10 seconds, it seems like HubSpot's 200 requests may be a big limiting factor. \n\nAre there any potential known workarounds or a way to increase the number of allowed requests? Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
