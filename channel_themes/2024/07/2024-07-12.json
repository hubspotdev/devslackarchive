    "text": "Hey <@U06N68R8Z0Q>, these subscription pages can't be modified like regular website/landing pages (might change in the future). They're mostly build upon one single module which is also quite limited.\nThe only things you can do by default are text changes and styling via css.  And both of those things can be done only in the design manager (or local dev environment). There is no real visual editing option available. \n\nAs of \"the second page\" it's not a page but rather an inline thank you message like in every other HubSpot form. The only thing you can change is wording. "
