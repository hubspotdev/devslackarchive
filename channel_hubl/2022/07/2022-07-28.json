    "text": "personal opinion — any chance you get to remove legacy code/css, take it. I’d pretend that the css file was gone and ask for more time to get this completed.\n\nIf there are complicated items, you can always use developer tools to inspect and give guidance, but I think redoing it will always result in better work. All of my work from 3 weeks ago is terrible, so I will always improve upon it"
