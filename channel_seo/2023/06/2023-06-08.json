    "text": "Hello! I'm currently working on improving the performance of a specific page. As you can observe, the Speed Index falls below the required threshold, which in turn affects the overall performance of the page. During my analysis using Lighthouse (Network), I noticed that the requests have a duration of 1.11 seconds. This extended response time can potentially impact the Time to First Byte (TTFB) of the page as well. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions or insights on how to reduce this response time and enhance the page's performance? Thank you.",
