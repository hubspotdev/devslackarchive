That gets messy quickly, particularly if you intend on using the quote wizard in conjunction with this kind of functionality.\n\nMy recommendation would be to create your own UI, using a CRM card held on Deals. With serverless functions to facilitate all of the necessary API requests -&gt; create the quote. And skip the editable fields on the quote page idea altogether.\n\nThere are alternative methods. Iâ€™ve tried quite a few of them, and the results were never satisfactory."
