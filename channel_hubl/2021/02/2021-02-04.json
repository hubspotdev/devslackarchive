    "text": "I can't seem to get the list of products in one of my portals with `crm_objects`. I'm using the exact same code I've used successfully in other portals, and I have several products in the portal, crm_objects just... isn't returning anything. My code is this:\n```{% set query = crm_objects(\"product\", \"&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=0\") %}\n{{ query|tojson }}```\nAnd the output is just `{\"results\":[],\"hasMore\":false,\"offset\":0,\"total\":0}`\nI don't really have any idea what's going on. I've also tried getting other objects on a passworded page, and it's the same. I've also tried a bunch of combinations of filters. Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong?",
