The thing that bugs me is that the deal amount doesn't get updated when the line items are added. It only updates when I change the amount through the UI. Am I missing something? Is there a setting I need to adjust?\nBest Regards,\nTom Richter",

Then the routine calls a batch read on the associations API (HubSpotClient.crm.associations.v4.batchApi.getPage) to get the associations using the fromObjectType and toObjectType to know what associations its looking for.  Then the associated objects that are returned are processed in groups of 50 in a loop and a call is made each time to batch read the actual objects (deals, line items, companies, etc - HubSpotClient.crm.deals.batchApi.read).  Finally all that data is returned.  So one call to the method returns all the actual object data for how ever many objects that is.  It works pretty good but it did take a while to write and test.  Each step along the way has error checking built in."

After logging in it does not redirect them back to the authorisation page, instead it just logs them into HubSpot and takes them to their dashboard.\n\nThis seems to have been mentioned <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/No-redirect-back-to-Oauth-authorization-page-after-logging-in/m-p/521424|several times in the community> and HubSpot <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/OAuth-bug-Scopes-are-Null-if-user-was-not-logged-in-before-the/m-p/892023|seems to argue that this is an expected behaviour>.\n\nFrom <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C2YHAHB6K/p1677167407260259|this existing thread>, I think this should work (and also because all the other oAuth providers I know allow you to do that, i.e logging as part of the oAuth flow) .
