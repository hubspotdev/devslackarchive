I've connected HubSpot to my Wordpress website using the API key in order to add people from the website who subscribe to a newsletter. However, it's not showing all my lists in HubSpot. Is this because the lists in HubSpot are Active and they need to be Static to connect with a website? If they are static, will everyone who subscribes to the newsletter on the website be added constantly?",
