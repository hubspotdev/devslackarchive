    "text": "Good morning, HubSpot Devs.\nMy team has been building websites on CMS for a couple of years now using themes from the marketplace. None of us are developers, so we just use what’s available with the themes we purchase.\n\nThe problem we’re running into is that we’re starting from scratch with each new client. What we’d like to do is have a few themes that are already customized to our needs. Would we have to create new themes and upload directly to the client portal? Should we hire a developer to make these themes? Not sure where to start with this.  Thanks!",
