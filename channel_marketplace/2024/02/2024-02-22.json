    "text": "Hi folks, floating this idea here first. I’ve run cohorts for HubSpot before of small/solo HubSpot Partners working together. The last was called “*Silverpeak*” with help from Dan Tyre and David Weinstein, where the first milestone was getting everyone to Silver (when Silver existed) and beyond. Around 60 agencies went through Silverpeak in 3 cohorts.\nI’ve been thinking of starting a similar group where small/solo developers work together to create and launch their first public app on HubSpot Marketplace. As that is the topic of today’s Developer HUG, I thought I’d float the idea here to see if there is interest. Thoughts?",
