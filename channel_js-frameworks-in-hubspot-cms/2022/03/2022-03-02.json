    "text": "Hey Krittiya, you might want to rethink that choice; the React/Vue boilerplates are moreso built with modules in mind rather than a full static site like Gatsby or Next. HubSpot already borrows a lot of the optimizations that come with those SSGs without having to incorporate a complicated build system and keep code readable and flexible for content editors. What is the goal youâ€™re trying to achieve by using these libraries?"
