We should not be using something undocumented in our examples, we should either be ensuring it gets documented (which then means we have to be concious of avoiding breaking it) or document an alternative solution like the CD one."

I already know the sandbox feature, but as far as i know there is only the option to sync files from the design manager like templates, modules but no pages, HubDB etc. Are there any articles about it? Thank you!"
