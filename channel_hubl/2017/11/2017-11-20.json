This is a doc I'm currently working on to explain this topic: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/185RvrqbMqZgDnHtLiS3iMt4zYKyCWqRtG9G599GWMM4/edit?usp=sharing> Feel free to comment. To answer you directly: The idea is that we're trying to encourage folks to do all of their custom code inside the context of a reusable module. The rationale is explained in that doc. Let me know if you still have questions because I want to make sure I cover this topic as well as I can."
