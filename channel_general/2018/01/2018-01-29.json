However, email (and blog) templates currently don't support Flexible Columns - I don't know if they ever will (perhaps a HubSpot rep here knows? :slightly_smiling_face: ).\n\nIf you want the user to be able to use the custom module several times inside the same email template, I would simply insert that module several times in the template and then inside the module add a boolean to allow the user to show/hide the module per instance.",
