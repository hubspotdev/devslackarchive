Is there a way to combine content from multiple HubSpot blog sources into a single sortable / filterable “index” page.  This index page would obviously have to be outside of the index page template for the individual blogs themselves.  We’ve not found a way with HubL so far as blog_recent_posts() is limited to 200 returned blog posts and there’s no blog_all_posts().\n\nThe client would like to have independent index pages for the different blog types + the ability to see content from all the blogs in a single location (with major visual differences between these two pages).",
