The problem is that I have like 20 ids/rows to pull. Since the HubDB filters only does AND conditions (OR is not supported), I have to resort to looping and calling the API for each ID/row.  Now there there’s a limit on HubDB calls, this no longer works.\n\nI tried using the __contains filter but that doesn’t work on “number” fields.\n\nAny help is most appreciated.",
