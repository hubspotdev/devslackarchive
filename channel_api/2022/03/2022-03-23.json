    "text": "You’re not far off if I’m reading things correctly; I usually use Axios rather than the direct HS client, but the same logic still applies. I’m assuming the code block above is within a `fetchContactDealIds(contactId, after)` function. and you’re using recursion to pass in the same ID as the original call and the resulting after property you get from the initial call (and any subsequent ones that require paging). If this is the case, my first suspicion for what might not be working would be the value or data type (string, object, etc…) of that `after` value. I usually will play around with Postman to make sure the call I’m making should work, so maybe reference the API endpoint that client should be querying and ensure the request your coded step is sending matches up."

    "text": "Thanks for the reply, <@U26BLKGE4> . You are correct in your assumptions. I was hoping to just use the client since I'm already using it in that function and I was hoping there was a built-in way of making subsequent requests using the client. It appears the order and number of arguments have changed since I first wrote this script in January, which has me thinking the api is overloaded in order to be backwards compatible. So when I pass in the after arg as undefined the first time, it doesn't recognize the associations arg, presumably due to the number of arguments in the call. I may have to resort to using axios for simplicity sake, I suppose. I just thought the client was meant to simplify things, such as automatic retries and error handling. "
