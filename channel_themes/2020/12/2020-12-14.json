    "text": "Hey all, new to HubSpot themes and HubSpot in general honestly. I'm a JS dev tasked with developing a theme/templates for a client. Was wondering something that most may feel is simple, how would I go about using custom fonts in a theme that aren't Google or web fonts. I'm not sure where to place the font face import or really where to start. Any help is appreciated, thank you!",

Not getting anything in the console in chrome except a 'addEventListener' of null error which would be JS I'm assuming, not a css issue."
