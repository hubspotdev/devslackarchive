    "text": "Regarding can you hook up other frameworks and use them on HubSpot - yes. It currently will require targeting class names used by the the CMS’s grid if using drag and drop(non-coded) templates, and for using the dnd areas functionality.\n\nWith the dnd_areas functionality whether or not the css file which loads the base layout css is loaded is up to you. The class names are the same, but the styles would not be imposed.\n\nfor example, you could simply add the base selectors to an existing similar framework as long as it follows a similar row column structure.\nExample: `.col-md-6` you could change to `.span6, .col-md-6` This would enable the same styles to be applied.\n\nMany of the developers here in this slack have done this, or created their own frameworks.\n\nWe hear you on the fact that not having control over the class names makes it harder to work with these frameworks. It’s something we’re aware of, over-all we’re shifting to try to meet developers where they are at. That’s been a driving factor in the work on the <#CLJJXGTC0|local-development>, developers want to use tools they’re familiar with, so we’re trying to enable that.\n\nWe don’t have anything to announce at this time on the class names front other than that with the dnd_areas it is up to you if you load the layout css."
