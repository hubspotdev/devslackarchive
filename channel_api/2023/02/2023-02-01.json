If you include mapping in your JSON file that doesn’t end up being used (that data isn’t in the import file), the API gets off by a column and tries to import everything after that in the JSON file. So if there’s a definition in the JSON file and there’s nothing in your spreadsheet that matches that, everything beneath that in the JSON file gets imported into the wrong column and it causes a bunch of import errors. Easy enough to fix, but seems like an unused mapping should just get ignored.",
