    "text": "Trying to utilize the `menu()` function to get a pseudo breadcrumb list of links depending on the page a visitor is on and encountered an odd scenario:\n```\n{% set crumb = menu(11126071274, 'page_id') %}\n{% set crumb2 = menu(11126071274, 'page_name') %}\n```\n1. trying to set the root_type as `page_id` or `page_name` is returning a `Error invoking function 'menu'` message, not sure why since the docs say these are available options for root_type (have tried them w/o the single-quotes, but same error).\n2. using `breadcrumb` as the root_type does get the current page, but only if you're on the deepest level at that point (ie: if you're on a page 3 levels deep and no further children). If you're on that parent page, the returned result is the first, deepest nested child. I assumed it was based on the current page you're on, but that was also the implication of the `page_id`/`page_name` root_type.\n\nAny thoughts/suggestions? I already have a workaround in place, but I don't think it's the way intended to work",
