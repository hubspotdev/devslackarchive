    "text": "I’m a bit confused about your code here. It looks like you have a hubdb table, with some content in it that has “tags” you are looking to match up with your blog post. Also if you use the ` key THREE times it wil create a code block like\n```{% set codeblock = '`' ~ '`' ~ '`' %}```\nI’m not sure what ” But the only problem is that i cant access these matches to filter the highest one.” What does “highest one” mean? Does that mean that your hubdb table is organized in an order, and you would like to bring in the first match?\n\nI’m not sure what your code is doing or not doing so… I’ll just create what I think is important, and you can fill in the blanks\nCheck this out —if I understand your issue correctly this should help you along your way\n\n<https://gist.github.com/NickDeckerDevs/a94d9bd5a7dafd6a692ef02343db2f9b>"
