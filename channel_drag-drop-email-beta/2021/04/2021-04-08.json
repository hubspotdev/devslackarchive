    "text": "Alright, frustrating issue this morning. Trying to convert one of our old email templates into a DND, but it's a RSS blog notification email. I recreated it using all DND controls in the GUI, go to save as template, and it says these kinds of emails can't be templates and that I should clone it instead. Then I try to clone, and that option isn't there either. Any insight into best practices here?"
