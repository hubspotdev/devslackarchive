    "text": "Hi all - another membership question. We're looking at the HubSpot suite to build out a website with registration/login where our members access a dashboard and content and activity that is specific only to them. I'm scratching my head over this looking at the docs and playing with a CMS trial so I am wondering if HubSpot simply isn't designed to be used this way and that it is really for blogs with gated content where access restrictions are based on groups of people as opposed to one user? Thoughts would be appreciated !"
