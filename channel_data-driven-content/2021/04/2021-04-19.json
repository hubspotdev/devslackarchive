    "text": "Hi! I think i found a bug:  When the {{ contact }} object is used on a page/template/module, caching is supposed to be turned off.  I am using that on a HubDB table powered page and detail page.  Caching indeed is turned off for the main/listing page, but the detail / single pages are still cached (and very sticky !). Furthermore, the {{ contact }} object doesn’t even seem to work on the detail/single page *unless* debug flag is on (?hsDebug=1).  If anyone can corroborate that’d be swell.    And, where else should I report the bug?",
