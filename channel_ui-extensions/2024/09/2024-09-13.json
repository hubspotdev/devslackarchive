When using `<Heading inline={true}>` inside of `<Tile>` the text is still wrapping to a new line when the documentation states that it should prevent the line from wrapping. _(Fixed this but might still be a bug, it was in a single tile object but I still needed to set the Flex container to display=\"column\" for some reason?)_\n2. There really needs to be a padding and margin system of some kind. It's hard to make some stuff look good with just flex, box and tile; as you can see here.\n3. Adding a bold option and heading sizes to the `<Heading>` widget would be very useful and allow users to have better typography.\n4. Allowing a use to center the title on a card",
