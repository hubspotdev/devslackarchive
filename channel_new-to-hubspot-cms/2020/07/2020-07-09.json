    "text": "Hi guys,\n\nSo nice to be here with you in this community.\nI'm Alex, from Romania, I have both a CMS Developer Certification as well as the CMS Marketer one.\nI'm part of a Marketing Agency form Romania that recently started working on a HubSpot CMS website projects and was wondering what's the best practice regarding where you start building it?\n\nWe're coming from a Wordpress background, an there we usually use a dev server and deploy to live only when the project is ready. I know there's the content staging option and the Sandbox option but I'm not sure how things are usually done in the HubSpot space when it comes to these things.\n\nAlso, I was wondering how do you guys go about getting access to the client's HubSpot ORG? Do you go on a user by user basis? Do you use a common Dev user so that more than one person can login using that account when doing work on the client's ORG?\n\nCould really use some feedback on this from more experienced veterans from here :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThanks so much in advance!"
