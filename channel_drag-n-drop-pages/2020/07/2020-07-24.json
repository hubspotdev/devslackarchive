    "text": "Hi everyone, I saw it’s already a raised problem for developpers but it would be really amazing to have the possibility to add our own custom classes to dnd_section, dnd_column and dnd_row. The system in general is really great, it offers a lot for marketers and clients but this feature really would make me win a lot of time. I know we can add several dnd_area which accepts custom classes but it feels like it’s not really usefull except for this so is it planned to deliver this possibility ? Thank’s everyone",
