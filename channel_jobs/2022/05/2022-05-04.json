We'll Tweet out this link as well as include it in the monthly developer newsletter so it will get a bit more exposure during the month.\n\n*What can you do?* \n• Go post your job opening there, too. You're welcome to reply on the forum thread with a link to an external listing, but you can also create a free(!) listing on the job listing part of the community and reply with a link to that. \n• We're looking for HS-specific developer / architect / technical positions only. \n• Not hiring or looking? Share and upvote the thread to help fill those jobs faster :slightly_smiling_face: \n*May's forum thread*: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Share-Your-Work/HubSpot-Developer-Jobs-in-May/m-p/627210#M852>\n\n_edited to add: Feel free to continue posting here on #Jobs, this is just another opportunity!_"
