    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am currently delving into the capabilities of Custom UI cards within HubSpot, specifically aiming to integrate them in the middle column of an object. I’ve come across a few areas where my findings are a bit uncertain, and I would greatly appreciate your insights or any clarifications from your experiences. Here are my questions and the conclusions I’ve drawn so far:\n\n1. *Selecting Rows in a Custom UI Card Table*: Is it possible to select one or multiple rows within a table in a Custom UI card? My current understanding is that using an Association table might be necessary. Although selecting multiple lines seems unfeasible, opening an object seems possible, which would likely trigger a sidebar pop-up (as standard in HubSpot) when clicking on a deal. In the standard Deals table, it’s possible to select one or several records and then edit them. This functionality isn’t clearly detailed in the developer documentation. What is the community’s view on this? Is this something you’ve managed to implement or see as feasible?\n2. *Checkbox Option within a Custom UI Card Table:* I couldn’t find a direct way to include a checkbox option within a table in a Custom UI card. The Multi-select input seems to be the closest alternative. Is there any workaround or method that can be used to incorporate a checkbox option directly in the table?\n3. *Horizontal and Vertical Scrollbars in a Custom UI Card Table:* My research hasn’t led me to concrete evidence about the implementation of horizontal and vertical scrollbars within a table in a Custom UI card. Pagination is documented, and many standard UI elements in HubSpot support vertical scrolling. However, horizontal scrolling isn’t readily apparent. Do any of you know a way to implement both horizontal and vertical scrolling in such tables?\nYour thoughts, experiences, or any examples you might have encountered would be incredibly helpful. Thank you in advance for your assistance and insights!",

There’s no onClick for table rows, what you will do is wrap your table cell/row within a Link and add some function to be carried out when clicked. If you’re thinking of selecting multiple rows, you can implement something like a cart where rows you click are added to the cart, and you have a button that triggers a function on all the rows(selected rows). \n\n2) Checkbox option: Use the toggle group component. Has a radio option (returns string) or checkbox list option (returns array of strings)\n\n3) Horizontal scrolling: Yes, it is supported"
