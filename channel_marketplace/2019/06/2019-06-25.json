Therefore, the more content you have = the more HTML you have = the larger the file size of the email's HTML. If you're using a drag-and-drop or some other editor that builds the email for you, usually it contains a lot of extra bloat (code), and can increase the file size quickly. Custom coded emails allows you to have more control for that."
