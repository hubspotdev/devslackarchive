    "text": "Hey all,\n\nI need to do a sync between HubSpot and an external tool via API.\nThe external tool doesn’t have webhooks and can’t modify me.\n\nI was going for this solution but it doesn’t seem right and I’m stuck with the limits of custom codes in the workflows:\n\n- A workflow is triggered every hour.\n- It retrieves the last contacts from the api of the external tool.\n- I search in HubSpot if this contact exists via email address. If yes, I update the values with the new ones. If not, I create it.\n\nI explode the time limit in customs code which is 20 seconds it seems. And I’m a bit stuck.\nMoreover, this method is not scalable.\n\nDo you have any ideas or an alternative to meet this need?\n\nThanks :slightly_smiling_face:",

    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI hope this is ok to put in here. Just launched a new Marketplace app to help workflow developers such as yourselves. It's called <https://www.cambiumapps.com/vlookup|VLOOKUP for Workflow>. The gist is that you can use a Google Sheet or your own CSV data as reference data, and then the VLOOKUP workflow action will use a property value to \"look up\" against the reference data and return an attribute from it. The concept is pretty simple, but its quite powerful. I found myself needing something like this in many implementations and its easier to leave clients with this kind of setup than custom code. I wanted to let you all know about it.\n\nIf this interests you at all, I'm happy to provide you with long-term access in a demo portal you use. For a Production system, I'm happy to provide you with a discount code for the Slack community members. DM me for that.\n\nThank you to <@U01QVR44MEY> for the help in this forum as I was developing the workflow action. I plan to return the favor and help the community with workflow needs, especially as it pertains to custom workflow actions.",
