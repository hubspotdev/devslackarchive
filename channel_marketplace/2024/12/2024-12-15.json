    "text": "<@U05F44JQBH7> Yes, nice to bump into you again :slightly_smiling_face:\nAnd yeah, I had similar troubles recently. I don't recall seeing any official updates or docs from HubSpot on the recent changes, which adds to the confusion. I also found that HubSpot no longer allows URLs declared for other purposes (e.g. App Homepage, App Support Page etc.) to also be used as the Install URL Button. I had previously just been directing prospective app users to my app homepage which included an install app CTA. To get around this, for better or worse, I simply submitted a new URL that redirects to my app homepage and that was accepted by HubSpot as part of the app review process. Hope that helps"
