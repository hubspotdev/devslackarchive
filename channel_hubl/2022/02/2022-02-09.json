I am using: `{% image \"image\" label=\"Header Image\", alt=\"Header Image\", src=\"../../images/home-illustration@2x.png\" %}` but for some reason it is not working or generating an area to edit in global content (see screenshot). I have altered the tag to use image_src which works but that is not the tag I want to use: `{% image_src \"image\" label=\"Header Image\", alt=\"Header Image\", src=\"../../images/home-illustration@2x.png\" %}` Any help would be much appreciated!!",

However, when I create a page and config it as a dynamic page, it only returns a two-phase prerender.\n\nI wonder if hubdb_table_rows() support the page to full prerendering but the dynamic (same principle, I think) can not?\nI posted a question here, feel free to put your answer\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/HubDB-when-the-page-gets-two-phases-and-full-prerender/m-p/573175#M27301>"
