Is that still the case?\n\n<https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/CMXUWUY5D/p1621592513013200>\n\nI also found <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Drag-amp-Drop-functionality-for-Blog-Posts/idi-p/408909|this article> that says its now been delivered, however I cannot see anywhere in the documentation on how to achieve this.",
