    "text": "Hey all, not sure if this goes here or <#C2YHAHB6K|api>, but I have an Ops Hub question. I have a client that deletes unengaged contacts from the CRM after a certain period of time, but would like to maintain any records of sales engagements (notes, emails, tasks, meetings, calls) on the company record before that contact is dropped. If I associate these engagements to the company object in addition to the contact they’re sourced from and then the contact is deleted, will those engagements still show in the company timeline? Or do I need to associate the engagement with the company record and then remove the contact association to ensure it persists?",

    "text": "Hi Mark, from my experience working with notes at least, you first create the note, and then associate it for it to show up. I believe that even if you delete all associations the note will still be there so I think you can delete the contact and the note will still show up in the company. Not sure if it works the same for all the other events but either way you can manually test this easily right?"
