    "text": "Yeah, I'm familiar. I might evolve it into a similar thing, but for now it's just a quick script to process my fields.js into fields.json files so I can easily maintain certain \"preset\" fields and field groups in a single file, and set up my fields.js files like\n```import cake from '#fields/cake';\nimport pie from '#fields/pie';\nimport apple from '#fields/apple';\n\nexport default [\n  {\n    \"name\" : \"something\",\n    ...\n    \"children\": [\n      cake,\n      pie,\n      apple\n    ]\n  }\n];```\nSo I can use `pie` , for instance, in multiple modules and modify it from a single file to get the changes to take place throughout all modules. I don't think `HubSpot-fields-js` really handles reusable fields/groups, and I'm not a huge fan of the syntax tbh, but definitely a good idea, making new fields is pain without the design manager."
