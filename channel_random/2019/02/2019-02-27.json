    "text": "I’ve always used pixels for media queries, but reading that article I might change. So what it says is don’t use rem because safari doesn’t behave correctly with it, and since it’s a media query it bases the em off the browser font size anyway. (I assume so you can’t set a media query that negate’s it’s self by setting the html font size).\n\nSo the only time it makes a difference is when a user has manually changed their browser font size, in which case it’s gonna make you’re site look dodgy anyway but by using em should allow content to be wider which would hopefully alleviate some of side affects of changing the browser font.\n\nFinally although this wouldn’t work for media queries, i’m a fan of setting the font-size to 10px and then using rem’s across the site as i can easily divide by 10  e.g. (body {font-size:1.6rem} , then in a media query i can change the font size down or up across the whole site just with html {font-size:}",

Some people feel they are no better than pixels but if i use rem on my font then all i have to do is change the body font siz to see a marked increase or decrease of font size site wide."
