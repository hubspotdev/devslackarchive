    "text": "According to this thread (<https://integrate.HubSpot.com/t/sslhandshakeexception-server-certificate-change-is-restricted-during-renegotiation/7379/7>) there was recently made a change that switched the certificate authority used for the SSL certificate at `<http://api.hubapi.com|api.hubapi.com>`. This caused all kinds of trouble for one of our clients, and I can see from the thread that they were not the only ones affected.\n\nWas this change announced anywhere before it was made, and if so, where and how do we get notified about such changes in the future? :slightly_smiling_face:"

Given the terminology of \"Topics\" and \"Topic Clusters\" we didn't want there to be any confusion between the two. At the time we updated all of the documentation, and I believe we handled a redirect for anything that was pointing to /topic (which would then redirect to /tag...).",
