    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm in need of assistance from someone familiar with HubSpot regarding the following issue. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but here it goes.\n\nI've built a web application using React and Node.js. In this app, I would like to include a URL to my HubSpot portal, which users can click on to be redirected. My requirement is that when the user clicks on the link, I want to handle the authentication programmatically (using client ID, secret, username, password, etc.) and then redirect them to the HubSpot portal.\n\nI'd like to know if this is possible and if HubSpot provides any APIs for accomplishing this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!"
