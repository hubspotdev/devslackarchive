    "text": "Hello,\n\nI would like to know if we can create an email with a full-width image on the mobile version.\n\nFor example, attached is the screenshot from the test email which has a border on the side of the image.\n\nThe image is a custom module we created through CSS coding and here is the code below-\n\n<div style= \"margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 100%\">\n{% linked_image\n    image-align= '{{ center }}',\n    label=\"Linked Image\",\n    src='{{ module.img.src }}',\n    alt='{{ module.img.alt }}',\n    width='100%',\n    height='auto',\n    link='{{ link }}',\n    target='{{ target }}',\n    open_in_new_tab='{{ target }}',\n    size_type='{{ module.img.size_type }}',\n    loading='{{ loadingAttr }}'\n%}\n</div>\n\nWe kept the \"width=100%\" but it didn't make any difference. We still have a space on both the sides.\n\nIs there a way to have full-width image on mobile version for the marketing emails?\n\n\nLooking forward to the response.\n\nThanks,\nUttu",

    "text": "Hello,\n\nI have a question regarding the preview of the emails in dark mode on gmail app-\n\nFor gmail app on IOS, our email appears weirdly in the dark mode. If the background of our email is dark, it appears light in the gmail app of IOS dark mode. Here's also examples attached of how it appears in Dark mode of IOS.\n\nIs there a way to fix this?\n\nCould this be a solution? -->\n\"Creating a custom template that would allow us to insert a CSS tag in the background (not possible without a custom template) that would detect if the client has activated darkmode, and thus adapt the background color accordingly. \"\n\nThank you again,",
