All the created CTAs are inside of an iFrame and is not possible to reach the CSS style to them at this moment.\n\nThere is a way to create custom CTAs with your own CSS &amp; HTML tho, but I don't know if that helps you:\nCTAs -&gt; Create new -&gt; Embeds and Buttons -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Embedded HTML",
