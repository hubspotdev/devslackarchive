    "text": "Hello, currently when creating a single new deal with the v3 api endpoint I get a '415 unsupported media type' response from the portal.\nWhen I copy the request body &amp; content-type headers from HubSpot into Postman and make the same request, everything works as expected and the deal is created with the appropriate values.\nI've confirmed the portal has the appropriate subscription level, and that all the properties and values are what is expected as well. Any idea or additional information I could look for regarding this api response?",
