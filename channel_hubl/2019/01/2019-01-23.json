    "text": "<@U2H3TT8F2> Just wanted to chime in on this, this actually won’t work because the order of operation is wrong.  For emails (this only applies to emails and not any other content type) the personalization tokens get filled in _after_ any HUBL logic fires. So your split to array and for loop will be operating on an empty string.  Right now the for loop that works in email is the `email_each` function that is used in the e-commerce workflows to iterate over line_items attached to deals.  FYI <@U7SL518D6>"

Any Ideas?\n\nAppreciate the help!",
