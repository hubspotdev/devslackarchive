I used a custom snippet visualizer, I had in my plans to also provide a syntax highlighting, and copy functionalities.\nDo you think the gist will still be a better option?\n\nI can see some benefits about using gist like forking and independent comment system and starring (if you go to the gist link) and not having to actually invest some time for the highlighting functionality although it doesn't provide a dark theme for the snippet and I would have to rework the highlighting anyway... (and it's a JS which I would rather prefer to don't use if I can avoid it:sweat_smile:).\nMissing something?"
