Does anyone know if you can change the url structure for a blog (<http://blog.domain.com|blog.domain.com>) to use the primary website url (<http://go.domain.com|go.domain.com>)? We have two blogs - our default blog is our actual blog, then we have a second blog for press releases. The press release blog currently uses <http://blog.domain.com/company-news|blog.domain.com/company-news> but we’d like for it to be <http://go.domain.com/company-news|go.domain.com/company-news>.",

    "text": "You can’t have two CMSs (e.g. HubSpot and WordPress) publish content to the same subdomain (<http://go.domain.com|go.domain.com>) - that’s because of how DNS works. You can only “point” a subdomain to one content host. You can, however, have as many blogs in HubSpot as you want to, and you can import your blog content if it’s from WordPress or Squarespace. <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/cos-blog/import-your-wordpress-blog-posts-into-your-HubSpot-blog>"
