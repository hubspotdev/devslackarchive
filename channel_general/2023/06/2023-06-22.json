But to change that, there's an option \"Custom Branding\" as well which is great and always lets you reply with aliases as \"Support\" or \"Company Name\" all the time.\n\nNow, instead of chatflows, we're using chatbots which kinda have the same behavior as it shows \"Hubbot\" at start but later when a real person replies, it starts to show an actual name. In the chatbot, I see no option to hide real agent's name. Is there something I'm missing out?\n\nAlso, thanks for creating a platform for this helpful community to come together",

Then you get hubl code that you should be able to paste into your system page template"
