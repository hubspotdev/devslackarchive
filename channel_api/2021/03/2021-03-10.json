I know what to do with the 3rd party app but I'm struggling with how to set up the HubSpot API to \"tell\" the 3rd party API when a ticket status changes.  Is that with HubSpot Workflows or is there some other way?  Thanks !"

If this is more complex than a custom integration could be built, especially if real time data transfer is needed.  My team has done integrations like this many times.
