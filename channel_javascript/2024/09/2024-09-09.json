    "text": "Hello! Im not sure if this is the correct channel for this but I am having an issue with some embedded forms on our site. For some reason, seemingly out of nowhere, the forms started to disappear when they were submitted with no value.\n\nSee the code for rendering the form: <https://gist.github.com/santiaday/a21dc3a91085eb0c69ddb2ee5b5e1db8>\n\nDoes anyone have any idea why this could be happening? I am also getting these console errors when submitting the empty form (see screenshot). I reached out to support and they said that our GTM scripts may be interfering, but i ran it without no third party scripts or anything and the error persisted.\n\nAny ideas of what else I can check for debugging? Thank you!!!",
