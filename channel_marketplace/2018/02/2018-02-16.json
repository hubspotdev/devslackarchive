For this reason, I would like these pages not to be indexed so that no one can find them in the SERPs and it does not affect our website rankings. How do you deal with that? Thanks a lot!:pray:"

I was wondering if some of you had a specific process to publish marketplace demo pages or if there is a trick to avoid keeping them in our main HS portal (publishing on another domain for instance?) . Anyway, this will do the trick, thanks Stefen!",
