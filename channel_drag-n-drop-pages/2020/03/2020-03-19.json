For example, the Accordion module comes pre-styled in purple, whereas the Button module simply outputs a plain &lt;a&gt; with appropriate classes for me to style it myself. The latter is my preference. I'm not including any of the boilerplate CSS so I'm not sure where this default module styling is coming from?"
