For example, if we search for the string \"809548,\" can we use an API call to delete all emails containing that string in the HubSpot inbox?\nThank you for your assistance!"

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.
