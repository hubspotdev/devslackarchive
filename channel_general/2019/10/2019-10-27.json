Since HubSpot requires email as the user id in any call it accepts, can that be included in non-identify calls like track? Is it a matter of passing it as a trait?\n2. Having a hard time with origination and attribution, of backfilling an anonymous visitor's activity after the identify call is made. I think this is because we aren't using HubSpot forms to create the contact. Instead, contacts are being made when Segment pushes the contact into HubSpot. However, the pageviews and other activity that should have been captured are not coupled with this contact.\n\nIs this something you've encountered? Do you have any advice?\n\nThanks!\n\nRon"
