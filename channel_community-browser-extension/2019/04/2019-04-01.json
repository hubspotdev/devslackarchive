    "text": "If you’re wondering where Sprocky went, he is now an opt-in feature. He’s still around, and his toggle is still in the chrome extension. I apologize if you previously did the toggle off then back on trick. That did not carry over, the way we stored the preference we could not do that. That said he’s easy to enable find him in the develop tab.\n\nHis X has been made easier to see/click, and a few quotes were added, and some redundant ones removed."
