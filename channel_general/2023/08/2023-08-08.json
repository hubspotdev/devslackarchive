When you use `npx`, it will check if the specified package is available in your local project's dependencies (in the `node_modules` directory) or if it's available remotely. If the package is not found locally, `npx` will download and execute the package temporarily without requiring a global installation.\n\nOn the other hand, when you install a package globally using `npm install -g`, the package is installed in a central location on your system, making it available for execution from any terminal window without needing to specify the full path to the package.\n\nIn your case, if you encountered deprecated dependencies when trying to install `@HubSpot/cli` globally using `npm`, it's possible that the package itself or its dependencies have undergone changes or updates that might conflict with older dependencies. By using `npx`, you effectively bypass the global installation and directly execute the latest version of the package without worrying about global package management.\n\nUsing `npx` is a valid approach, especially if you encounter issues with global installations due to dependency conflicts or deprecations. It ensures that you're using the latest version of the package and its dependencies without affecting your system-wide package environment.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nCheers!"
