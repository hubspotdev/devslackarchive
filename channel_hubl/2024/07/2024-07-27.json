    "text": "There's an option for logo modules to have fallback text for the company name. I think this is saying that you are missing the use_account_default parameter so that it will default to the settings the user has already configured in the account.\n\nYou'd need to inspect the code in the logo module, except it looks like it's in the HubSpot folder which wouldn't be editable unless you clone it down to a child theme.\n\nAre you working with a child theme of a HubSpot theme and customizing the header? If so, you'd need to also clone the logo module to the child to fix the warning. It's just a warning though, so it will still work the way it's coded."
