    "text": "Hello everyone, I hope this is the right place to ask for this. Not able to integrate with GTM livechat in our website. The problem is that we use sharedArrayBuffer in our website, so we need resources served from outside to include Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header. The problem is the one showed in the screenshot, the iframe loaded by HubSpot is blocked due to this issues..., any help or idea on how to integrate livechat in that case?",

    "text": "<@U05SY8MRH39> - as Nich called out - using the global form event listener is great to use for this purpose.\n\nOne other item I wanted to call out: because forms render via react, inputs utilize the virtual DOM and if you're trying to programmatically insert data into a field, you also likely need to fire a 'change' event so that the change propagates from the DOM into the virtual DOM.\n\nI have a gist here that explains and shows one way you could do this (don't judge the code, not a full time dev :slightly_smiling_face: ) <https://gist.github.com/robertainslie/32d786d7254ec7bc6cbbff3d1e292cd4>"
