    "text": "Hello! I am looking to better understand what might be going wrong with the module I have created for line-items being inserted into a programmable email.\n\nI have this code that works wonders:\n```{% set line_items = deal['line_items'] %}\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  {% for line_item in line_items %}\n    &lt;li&gt;\n      &lt;h4&gt;{{ line_item['name'] }}&lt;/h4&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Quantity: {{ line_item['quantity'] }}&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Price: {{ line_item['price'] }}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n  {% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;```\nBut when I try to add something that will multiply the quantity by the price in order to get the _total_ it makes the template in-usable. I was using something like this:\n```&lt;p&gt;Total: ${{ line_item['quantity'] * line_item['price'] }}&lt;/p&gt;```\nHowever this seems to be the issue. Any time I try to get the module to do math on the values.",

    "text": "So I think I figured out what the issue is likely. And it's definitely the \"calculation\" piece. I found the `amount` property that exists on the line item level and tried implementing that in the module as well. Even when trying to print that property we run into issues with the template. Turns out that property is the property type of `calculation_equation`. So it really just seems like emails are not happy with math. :laughing:"
