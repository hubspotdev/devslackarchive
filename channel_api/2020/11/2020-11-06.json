    "text": "*A general question about the HubSpot API.* \nAssume: A company has a large team of sales representatives who look after customers locally. New leads should automatically be assigned the property \"Contact ownership\" with a HubSpot user. What is the best way to do this and is it possible to use the API for it?\n\n*Requirements, the idea:*\n• Trigger form with the lead or contact\n• Extend HubSpot User with address information\n• Conversion of the address data into geographic coordinates\n• Find closest HubSpot user based on the coordinates\n• Set the contact property \"ownership\"\n• When deleting a hubSpot user recalculation for all contacts without assigned \"ownership\"\nA comparison based on the postcode appears to be too high in terms of maintenance.",
