    "text": "Hello everyone! This is a question about *Batch Push.*\n\nLet’s say I want to create a batch of 10 contacts and one of these contacts already exists in HubSpot. I initiate the batch job and the API returns a conflict error with a message “_Contact already exists. Existing ID: 10551_”. It seems that there is no way currently to know that which of the 10 contacts that I pushed was a duplicate. So I essentially have to query the CRM for this existing contact via the provided ID, remove that contact from my batch and try again, hoping that I don’t hit another duplicate. I would need to do this continuously until the call succeeds. Is there a better way to approach this? Thanks!",
