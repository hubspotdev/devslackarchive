I’ve done that before myself.\n\nThe links are ordered based on the frequency that all users of the extension as a whole click each link.(more frequently used links are at the top)\n\nI like listing the links in that fashion but you’re absolutely right that with those two links it’s easy to click the wrong one.\n\nwhat do you think of this solution - change the label for those links.\n\nContent staging could simply be renamed to Staging.\n\nContent settings could be renamed to Page Settings as it goes there.\n\n(we don’t necessarily need to change the labels for BOTH links just changing one would likely solve the issue)"
