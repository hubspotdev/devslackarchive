We are taking an iterative approach, but our primary goals are to use SCSS and PostCSS for all CSS assets across the theme folder, built-in image optimization for theme assets, and have all JS run through babel so we can use ES6 and still support our standard browser set. We are going to be experimenting with what our ideal output will look like, but a top priority for us now is getting our developers the tools they want."
