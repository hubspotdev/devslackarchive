    "text": ":wave: Hi everyone! Recently we started doing integration of HubSpot with our product <https://emailanalytics.com/|EmailAnalytics>. On EmailAnalytics we provide a detailed analytics of their all inbound &amp; outbound emails. Now we want our customer to get the emails of their customer from HubSpot into our software.\n\nThe way it works currently is they create `Contact Views` in HubSpot and we want to get all contacts inside that views into our software. We are not able to find Contact View API inside our developer account.\n\nCan anyone help me finding that API from where we can get list of contacts inside any `Contact view`\n\nMuch Thanks,\nHiren\n<http://EmailAnalytics.com|EmailAnalytics.com>"

The documentation for HubSpot’s APIs both legacy and new are so inconsistent in defining limits to ‘count’ or ‘limit’ query parameters. I would assume i could set it to the maximum limit of 10k since that’s all i’m able to get from this endpoint :thinking_face: and it’s not specified.",
