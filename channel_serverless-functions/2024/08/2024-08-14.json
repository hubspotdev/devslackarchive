That means the contact that logs in is connected to a HubSpot contact record. \n\nIf you do something like {{contact|tojson}} on your private content page, then go into an incognito window (so you aren’t logged into HubSpot as that causes a conflict with contact data), goto private content, sso login, goto private content page, you should see the contact data displayed in json format "
