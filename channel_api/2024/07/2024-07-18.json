    "text": "Hi\nI'm reaching out for assistance on optimizing our import process via the HubSpot API. We're currently facing a couple of challenges and would appreciate your expertise.\n1) Batch API Import: We've been using the batch API to import records. However, if any record contains an error, the entire import process fails. This forces us to manually remove the erroneous records and resend the import request, which is quite time-consuming.\n2) Individual Record Import: We also attempted importing records individually. While this avoids the batch error issue, it is impractically slow for our needs, as we need to process thousands of records daily.\n\nIs there a more efficient way to handle API imports in HubSpot that could help us overcome these issues? Any advice or best practices you can share would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance."

The value can be `BOUNCED`, `FAILED`, `SCHEDULED`, `SENDING`, or `SENT` ) that is registered with NULL values? The documentation doesn't mention this case, I imagined that it may be due to emails that were in draft, but the null values overcome the total amount of emails, I believe it's not likely that we would have that many drafts.\n\nThanks in advance :slightly_smiling_face:"

My thought was to develop a list that our data entry folks can work from as well as having the ability to query via one of the API's.  The idea would be to have a single set of filter criteria to produce the list to work from either way."
