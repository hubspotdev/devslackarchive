I looked online and there were some post about using custom code snippets to connect them together, but I'm having some trouble working out how to accomplish this. I was wondering if anyone has any experience regarding something like this?",

I know \"Last Activity Date\" is available (so I can use that as the trigger for my workflow), but can't figure out how to find a value to copy in for the \"Type\", for activities.\n\nTo be clear, this would be phone, email, linkedin message, etc.\n\nThanks!",
