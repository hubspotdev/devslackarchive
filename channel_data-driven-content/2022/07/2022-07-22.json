    "text": "Hello GraphQL BETA developers,\n\nI wanted to inform you of a small breaking change we are making to how select and multi-select fields are handled in the GraphQL schema. On August 1st at 11 am EST, we will begin to treat these column types for HubDB tables as an HS_Enum, rather than a String.\n\nThis will impact the way select and multi-select column types get returned in the response of your GraphQL queries. They are currently returned like:\n```\"multi_select\": [\n              \"Option 1\",\n              \"Option 2\"\n            ],\n\"select\": \"Select option 1\"```\nAfter this change, they will be returned like:\n```\"multi_select\": [\n              {\n                \"value\": \"Option 1\",\n                \"label\": \"Option 1\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"value\": \"Option 2\",\n                \"label\": \"Option 2\"\n              }\n            ],\n\"select\": {\n              \"label\": \"Select option 1\",\n              \"value\": \"Select option 1\"\n            }```\nWe are making this change as we intend to introduce separate labels and values for select column types in HubDB, similar to how it works in the CRM, and want a unified experience for returning the labels and values. Please let me know if you have any questions!",
