    "text": "Hi there.\n\nFor the last two weeks (roughly) we are experiencing missing images in Outlook 2016. All other clients seem to be fine. We ruled out VPN and corporate email rules already by testing with a private account outside the VPN.\n\nThere's already a rather lengthy thread about Outlook 2016 in the community (<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Email-Marketing-Tool/Images-from-HubSpot-not-rendering-in-Outlook-2016/td-p/87075>), but none of the discussed problems seem to be the one we are experiencing.\n\nThe email preview for 2016 in HubSpot looks fine by the way.\n\nHave there been any changes to the image pipeline that might cause problems or have there been other reports of something like this recently or are we an isolated freak case?\n\nWe would be grateful for any insight into this.",

Inspecting the code shows the email where the image didn't show up it had a PNG with a bunch of parameters added to the end of it within the `src`  (which works fine pasted into Chrome directly), while the one that worked does not. Not sure if that was the exact cause but it's the main difference I can see."
