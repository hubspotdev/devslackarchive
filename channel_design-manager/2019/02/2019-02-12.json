I am able to get the pagination and number of total webinars dynamically. However, when I click on the tag category, I am unable to bring the pagination for that particular tag and the total count of videos/webinars under that particular tag.  Do someone has done this or have a solution or approach for me? Thank you in advance for your help.\n\nWould also like to know what is the right way to build a directory landing page for videos in HubSpot CMS.",
