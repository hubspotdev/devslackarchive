I can post elsewhere if needed.\n\nFor the nodejs HubSpot sdk, there's a command for getting all products:\n```HubSpotClient.crm.products.getAll()```\nreference: <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs>\n\nWhen I run this, is there a way to get additional properties back than what it provides by default? I need the SKU, but that's not included by default\n\nIt provides products back in this format\n```{\n    \"id\": \"123\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"createdate\": \"2021-02-19T22:41:38.101Z\",\n      \"description\": \"description text\",\n      \"hs_lastmodifieddate\": \"2021-03-06T22:21:21.019Z\",\n      \"hs_object_id\": \"123\",\n      \"name\": \"Product Name\",\n      \"price\": \"0\"\n    },\n    \"createdAt\": \"2021-02-19T22:41:38.101Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2021-03-06T22:21:21.019Z\",\n    \"archived\": false\n  }```"
