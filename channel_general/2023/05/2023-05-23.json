Suddenly it started reporting that `CONDITIONAL_SINGLE_FIELD` is not a valid field type. Unfortunately, I forgot to save a screenshot. The endpoint worked on its own (the same as in your case).\nYesterday I couldn't find anything wrong with the app or the action and this morning when I wanted to resume debugging, everything was working normally."
