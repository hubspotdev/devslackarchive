    "text": "Hi I have a question regarding serverless functions and api secrets.\n\nI have a serverless function calling a rest api which uses basic authentication.\n\nWhile the secret is obviously not front facing in the serverless function, I dont want the key to be visible in the git repo. While the repo is private and is likely to always be private, its generally a bad idea to be pushing api secrets to github, and is the sort of thing that would keep me awake at night.\n\nIs there a way I could store the secret, within HubSpot, pull it into my serverless function without exposing the key in the repo?",
