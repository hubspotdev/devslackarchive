    "text": "Hello! I am trying to fix an issue in the navigation. The newly redesigned page is not published (draft), and there are some links present that should redirect to the main domain page. But those links redirect not to the main domain page but to the other dev domain on which is redesigned page. How can I make them redirect to the main page? I am using the link element `{% set href = module.testimonial_link.url.href %} &lt;a href=\"{{ href }}\"&gt;See more &lt;/a&gt;`  . On the page it renders like `&lt;a href=\"?hsLang=en\"&gt;See more&lt;/a&gt;`  whereas it should 'https:\n//example-domain/see-more-page. Thanks in advance for your help!"
