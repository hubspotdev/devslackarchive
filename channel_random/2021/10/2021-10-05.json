Shes influenced a lot of the most important HTML CSS and browser improvements over the last 10+ years.\n\nI’ll share a similar one.

The best people know - that they dont know, and actively seek to surround themselves with those who do. Strive to put yourself in situations where you wont be the smartest person in the room and listen to those who are."
