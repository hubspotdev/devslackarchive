Is is currently possible to have dependant form fields display on a card based on a previous form selection, similar to how HubSpots native form builder works?\n2. Can a value in a field that is a part of a form be retrieved and used as a variable prior to the form being submitted, or is it only possible to retrieve the value with `payload.formState.fieldName` once the form has been submitted?\n3. Are attachment fields something that you guys are looking to add as a card component?\n4. When using the IFRAME action type in a button that is part of a form, is it possible append the form input values to the iframe uri as query parameters?\n",
