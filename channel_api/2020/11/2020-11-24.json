    "text": "Hey, this is Vivek here. I work with a data integration company. I have a query regarding search API for any object(say, tickets)\n\nThe API supports pagination till <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/search|10k records>. What if the value of `hs_lastmodifieddate` remains the same for more than 10k records? It is important for us to fetch all updated data in near real-time. In order to do that, we use the simple search query filter( hs-modified-ts greater than equal to) in the API  `/crm/v3/objects/tickets/search` . Is there a workaround? Thanks in advance, cheers!",
