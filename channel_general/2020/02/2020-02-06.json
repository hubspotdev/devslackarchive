If you create a folder/file in a specific location in HubSpot files, then you move it somewhere else and you create again the same folder/file in the same location as the previous one, HubSpot will tell you the folder/file already exists in this location even if I moved the previous one to another place and will block you from creating/adding it. This could be quite annoying. Did someone experience the same? Someone from HubSpot could confirm if this is a known issue?",
