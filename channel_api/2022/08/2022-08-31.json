This can be done for all of the standard objects, but not custom objects, as far as I am aware.\n\nFilter 2 would be - propertyName: “pipeline” with a “value” matching the internal id of the pipeline in question. This can be found through the HubSpot UI by going to Settings -&gt; Objects -&gt; Deals -&gt; Pipelines -&gt; Select the E-commerce pipeline -&gt; click on the little “&lt;/&gt;” to reveal its internal id.
