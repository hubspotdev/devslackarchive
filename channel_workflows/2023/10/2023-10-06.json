    "text": "HELP! So I have been trying to build out the referral program via custom code actions in a workflow from one of the HubSpot workshops that a previous account manager sent to me as a use case for Ops Hub...\n\nEverything so far has been working as expected. I have a rudimentary knowledge of JavaScript (enough to get me into trouble) I was able to debug some of the previous reference errors I was getting, but now that I have whack-a-moled my way through those I keep getting this warning:\n```WARNING: The logs for this function have exceeded the 4KB limit.```\n when I run a test on this code:\n```/*\nThis code is used to attribute a referral back to the correct contact. This is done by querying the CRM to find a contact matching\nthe referrer value associated to the enrolled contact.

I’d recommend trying to be more specific in what you’re logging and/or troubleshoot by returning before all of your code executes, going step by step until you find the culprit. Bottom line being, you’re going to want to limit the amount of data being logged. Testing locally is another option. Can be a bit inconvenient."
