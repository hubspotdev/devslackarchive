    "text": "Hey everyone :wave:\n\nAfter a lot of hard work, we’ve just officially launched a new way to build, integrate, and automate on HubSpot with <https://sequin.io|Sequin>.\n\nWe’ll sync all your CRM standard objects, custom objects, and associations to your database in real-time. You can use SQL, your favorite ORM, and the frameworks you know and love to build on your data seamlessly. Then, you’ll write through the Sequin HubSpot Proxy to simultaneously update HubSpot and your database.\n\nEspecially for growing and large Hubs, Sequin removes friction. You don’t need to worry about rate limits, access tokens, navigating nested API calls or pagination, missing webhooks, or complex workflows.\n\nWe’re in this HubSpot Slack regularly and would love to hear any questions or feedback. Learn more in our Reddit post :point_down:  and we’d appreciate a :+1: if this is interesting!\n\n<https://www.reddit.com/r/HubSpot/comments/11yi3hk/we_just_launched_sequin_a_new_way_to_automate_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3>"
