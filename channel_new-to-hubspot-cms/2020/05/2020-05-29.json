An easier way to create global content may come to the UI.\n\nWe build largely CMS CLI first, as that is generally the preferred environment for most developers. That way they can use their favorite code editors, and tools.\n\nIf you haven’t gone done it yet, I highly encourage going through our <https://designers.HubSpot.com/tutorials/getting-started|Quick Start tutorial> which within just a few minutes shows you how to set up the <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/developer-reference/local-development-cms-cli|CMS CLI> and start making changes within a HubSpot account."
