I created the custom object but I'm having a hard time connecting the dots between logged-in user list membership and giving that list access to specific rows in the db. Has anyone done this or can point me in the right direction? I am pretty new to hubl and am from the .NET world where I would typically have another routine that determined user access before rendering the list from my db. So far I'm lost doing this with HubSpot cms. My object will have attachments - those attachments are the actual pdf docs that will be displayed. Everyone on the 'Boeing' list will see Boeing related documents."
