I would say currently it makes  sense if you are new to HubSpot development all-together to  use the design manager for awhile until you’re used to  that, then move toward local dev after. The reason being - some things will make more sense to you that way.\n\nThere isn’t yet a standard setup for using webpack, babel, etc. with HubSpot everyone is still kinda experimenting with what the best way is. If you find a good setup be sure to share it, as many on here would love to know"
