This tool eliminates the guesswork and provides everything needed to set up associations correctly.\n\n*How You Can Help:*\n\t•\tThe app is *completely free*\n\t•\tIt needs to be *battle-tested*—I’m looking for feedback from HubSpot developers to refine and improve it\n\nIf you’re interested in trying it out, let me know, and I’ll send you the link.\n\n#HubSpot #HubSpotDev #Automation #API #FreeTool"
