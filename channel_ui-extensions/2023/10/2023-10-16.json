The issue has been raised with the team behind it, but there was a miscommunication when creating the playbook between what should show up on an actual card and what should show in an iFrame modal. Their team has created components in the same style as HubSpot’s UI to create these types of experiences and keep them feeling natural, but there was some confusion with the designer of the playbook who put some of those custom iFrame examples directly on a card."
