I am trying to display sum in email template. This is always giving 0.\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n```{% set valuesArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] %}\n{% set sum = 0 %}\n\n{% for value in valuesArray %}\n   {% set sum = sum + value %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n<p>The sum of array elements is: {{ sum }}</p>```",
