    "text": "Hi, We have CRM card known as the 'Deals Sidebar.' This card is designed to filter and display only PCT pipeline deals in the sidebar. However, over the past month, we have been encountering serverless function errors with some frequency, although this issue is not affecting all companies. We are seeking assistance to identify the root cause of the problem and guidance on how to resolve it. Attached error log as well please check.\n\nPlease note that this CRM card is not based on React. We are using an older method that was launched before the introduction of React-based CRM cards. Is there any root cause of this problem?",
