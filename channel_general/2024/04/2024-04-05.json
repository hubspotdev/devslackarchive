I am using it in the menu module and when the link to the website content is passed the output is the same page on which the user is. For the external links,  it works correctly. And the same behavior is for the URL field. Are there any restrictions for using the link in the menu or am I doing sth wrong? `&lt;a href=\"{{module.testimonial_link.url.href }}\"&gt;See more&lt;/a&gt;` ",
