You will need to edit the setup of your serverless function because right now it won't return any data. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/serverless-functions>"

    "text": "hi guys, Im trying to use a module choice to dictate what a few css properties are and am having trouble, not sure why\n``` {% for item in module.pillar_items %}\n     {% if item.title_position_option == \"title_top\" %}\n      {% set title_top = 0 %}\n      {% set title_bottom = \"\" %}\n     {% elif item.title_position_option == \"title_bottom\" %}\n      {% set title_bottom = 0 %}\n      {% set title_top = \"\" %}\n    {% endif %}\n\n&lt;!-- some render logic below based off of *title_bottom* or *title_top* --&gt; ```\nthing is, I've done almost exactly the same for `icon_option` and whenever I change the option there, the module actually rerenders properly using virtually the same method as above. The reason I'm doing the above as well is because for each item in pillars, if I don't constantly re-`set` the vars, then both top and bottom will get applied somewhere down the line for remaining elements. I'm sure there's a better way of doing this as well so if anyone has a way, please let me know!",
