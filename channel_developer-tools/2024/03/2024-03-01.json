    "text": "Hi everyone, I'm new on HubSpot and have been assigned two tasks that I would really use your help on.\n1. As a workflow running in HubSpot I should be able to create an Unique URL that points to a webpage for a specific Company. \n2. When a User accesses this unique url, they will be presented with a form that would be able to create them as a contact in HubSpot and linked to the company. \nI am facing 3 challenges:\n1. I have no idea how to create this unique url. \n2. The submission of the form I have hit the endpoint (`/crm/v3/objects/contacts?hapikey=`). The req payload has a param '`company`' but this does not create the link between the contact and the company. \n3. For reasons related to problem in number 2, I opted to use the associations APIs to try and link the contact and the company, However, I'm unable to test this endpoint on postman. Getting and error of insufficient permissions. \nCan anyone please guide me on how to go about these three challenges? I would greatly appreciate.\n\nBR,\nThuo",
