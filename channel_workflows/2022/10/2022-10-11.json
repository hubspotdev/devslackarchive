If not could someone clarify the programming language / method used for custom code that can be created for internal workflows / process automation via Ops Hub? I checked for documentation online and only found info on HubL syntax which appears to be related to CMS and not sure if this is what is used for Ops Hub? If not can someone point me to some online resources for myself and my developers to learn more about Ops Hub? Thank you!\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl>"
