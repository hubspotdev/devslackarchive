I've added code for the responsiveness to go down to 2 slides on iPad and 1 on mobile but for some reason it isn't working just keeps shrinking down. I also added \"dots: true\" in the main code then \"dots: false\" in the responsive section and it didn't disable them so it is like it isn't seeing what is in the array. I'm not getting any errors in the console either. Any ideas would be appreciated.",
