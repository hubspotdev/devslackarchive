When running:\n```npx hs upload theme/dist My-Theme```\nIt says it's successful, but no files are uploaded:\n```Uploading files from \"theme/dist/\" to \"My-Theme\" in the Design Manager of account XXXXXXXX\n[SUCCESS] Uploading files to \"My-Theme\" in the Design Manager is complete\nTo preview this theme, visit: <https://app.HubSpot.com/theme-previewer/XXXXXXXX/edit/dist>```\nWhere the theme preview URL doesn't seem correct (`/dist` should be `/My-Theme`). I've tried it on a couple different HubSpot instances with no luck.",
