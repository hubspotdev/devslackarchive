If I then change the select field to something other than _image_, Boolean 2 remains visible in the editor. The setting has no effect but is quite confusing for editors.",

Further testing has revealed that it's specifically choice fields on a higher nesting level that don't work as display conditions. I've tested\n- Choice fields within the same level: works as a display condition\n- Choice fields the next level up: does not work\n- Other kinds of fields the next level up and on the same level: does work\n- Choice fields at the root level: works\n- Choice fields in non-repeating groups: works\n- Putting the display condition field in a non-repeating group: works\n\nIt looks like it's just choice fields in a repeating group, set as display conditions for a nested repeating group",
