It would have been great if this component had a delete button for each record.",

However, you’d like to add an option to “Delete” the line item from the “Actions” dropdown you see on hover?\n\nI think this would be an excellent use case for extensible actions. We have been investigating adding the ability to customize the actions displayed when hovering over rows. We would support all the actions available through the `CrmAction*` components.\n\nAre there other actions you would like to see in this location? Or other components you would like to similarly customize?"
