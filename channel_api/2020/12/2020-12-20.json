    "text": "<@U01CFE2DVFT> In my experience, you should expect regular 500 and 502 errors from the HubSpot API (I see 5 to 20 of these per day) and infrequent 504s, and handle them with retries with an exponential back-off.  The formula I've been using is a 50ms delay, doubled on each error to a max of 10s, and hard fail 2 minutes after the initial attempt.  Almost every time, it will recover on the first or second retry; I've only seen it hit the 2 minute hard stop during sustained outages (i.e. stuff that makes it to <https://status.HubSpot.com/>).  I've also seen very occasional 520s (that's some weird Cloudflare-specific code).  I've seen maybe two of these in the last 6 months; the last one came a week ago so I added it to my retriable error list.  Of course I haven't hit one since then, so I don't know if a retry strategy is worth it for that particular error.",
