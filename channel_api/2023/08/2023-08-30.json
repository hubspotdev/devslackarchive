I've successfully set up a custom object, \"webinars,\" in HubSpot, and I'm using custom code in Zapier to associate contacts with specific webinars and label these associations (e.g., 'registered,' 'watched,' 'replay watched').\nHowever, I couldn't locate an API endpoint to retrieve these association labels between contact objects and webinar objects. Is there an API endpoint like:\nGET Endpoint: `/crm/v4/objects/contact/{objectId}/associations/webinars/{toObjectId}/labels`\nYour guidance on how to access these association labels would be greatly appreciated.",

What I'm actually looking for are the labels that have already been assigned between two specific object instances.\n\nTo put it simply, I need the labels that are set between a contact instance and a webinar instance. For instance, let's consider \"Harun\" as a contact and \"Webinar121\" as a webinar. The association between them has been labeled as 'registered' and 'watched.' This means that Harun registered for and watched the webinar121. My goal is to access these labels using the IDs of the contact and webinar objects.\n\nJust to clarify, I'm not interested in all labels, only the ones that are specifically associated with these instances.\n\nThank you for your assistance. I'm eagerly awaiting your response."
