Any of you faced this before ?",

    "text": "That seems like a route we can explore. Indeed we do not need auto emails as we are using our own stack and custom workflows(on our own servers) to trigger the emails as needed. As such we don’t necessarily require any properties at all. It was a “nice to have” feature that the single send API would create/update a user if they didn’t exist but doesn’t matter. I’ll reach out to our account rep to get access to programmable emails. "
