    "text": "Hey, I'm having issues with `hublParameters` . I'm passing an array based on `content.translated_content` from global partial to header component, which works for some time (maybe only minutes) and all of a sudden the array is empty. When I change name of the array it gets populated again. Is there a bug with `hublParameters` or am I missing something? Screenshot of `logInfo(hublParameters);` where you can see that I've tried changing name of the array three times (lang, langSwitcher and languages)",
