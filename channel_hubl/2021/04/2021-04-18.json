Output of this variable shows as 19/04/21 so for matching purposes I set the senddate as follows:\n`{% set senddate = local_dt|datetimeformat('%d/%m/%y') %}`\nThe full script looks like below, but it is not showing any results for the contact with hs_object_id `55742524` It does when I remove the senddate from the query. Any help on how I can only show objects that have the booster_send_date as the date of today would be much appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:\n```\t\t{% set contact = crm_object(\"contact\", 55742524, \"agent_id, first_name, last_name, agent_full_name, agent_first_name, hs_object_id\") %}\n\t\t{% set senddate = local_dt|datetimeformat('%d/%m/%y') %}\n\t\t{% set query = \"agent_id__eq=\"~contact.agent_id~\"&amp;booster_send_date__eq=\"~senddate~\"\" %}\t\t\n\t\t\t\t{% set associated_listings = crm_associations(contact.hs_object_id, 'USER_DEFINED', 2, query, 'agent_id,booster_send_date', true) %}\n{% for listing in associated_listings.results %}```",
