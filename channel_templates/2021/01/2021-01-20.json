    "text": "Hi all, I'm relatively new to HubSpot and developing my css skills, but I've been asked to update the system pages for email (un)subscription and preferences. But now I'm stuck n 2 things\n1. the styling of the button on the unsubscribe form keeps showing me HubSpot branding instead of colorscheme I'm using on other pages. Can anyone explain how I can change/overrule this?\n2. On the styling of the preferences page is a very odd spacing (see image), but the only css on the subscription preferences is text align left. What should I do different?\nAny support is much appreciated. Thanks!",
