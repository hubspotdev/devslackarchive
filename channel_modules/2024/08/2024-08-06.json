    "text": "<@U25PYL3Q8> I realized that it can't be a child theme because of the fact that it never had a theme.json. I thought the child theme had to \"extend\" to the parent from within the theme.json, unless there is some other way I don't know about.\n\nI'm back to it this week on and off. Going to try a few things. Maybe I'll clone some of the template files to html and see what happens and continue messing with the theme, renaming and copying it again. If I don't make any progress, I'll let you know. It's not a rush, but maybe you could still take a peek or something, if you're available."
