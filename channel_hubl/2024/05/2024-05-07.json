    "text": "<@U06T2CXKFTQ> hey, you can try loading the form via js. When the page is loaded, create a promise in which you create a script tag with form js link `&lt;//js.hsforms.net/forms/v2.js&gt;`. When the link is loaded you can resolve the promise and run the `hbspt.forms.create` function that HubSpot uses under the hood. Also, you have to make sure you grab the `hutk` cookie and pass it to the `hbspt.forms.create` function to get the analytics in place.\nI normally add the intersect observer on top of that.\nThe downside is that it can cause the layout shift. So if your form is on the top of page I'd not recommend to go with this js form loading."
