Once created open the page you'd like to personalize, select the module which should contain the personalized content and click on \"+add\" at the top of it(first screenshot). Then select \"contact list membership\"(second screen) as \"source\" and add all the lists you'd like to have personalizations for(third screen). Once created, you should see the smart rules changing to something like this(fourth screen). The last step(s) are:\n1. select the option you'd like to personalize for\n2. change the content\n3. save\nRepeat those 3 steps for every list/personalization option in every module",
