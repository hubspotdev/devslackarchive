I am quite new as Hubspost developer (only 2 months), and in these last days I learnt a lot how to add the functionalities to the pages, but there is still something that I miss in the logic of the development of a template. I mean, I know how to develop a basic template, but if I have to add a background image also if I add the functionality I can't see it as background."
