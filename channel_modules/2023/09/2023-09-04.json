I develop a small global module, containing several fields, like choice, richtext, and I met a problem - I can't override any fields value in my template code.  On generated page all fields has values only from CMD global content editor. So is it feasible to override those values in template?\nMay be it's weird question. Because this is first question here and I'm very newbie in HubSpot %)",

    "text": "the main Idea was to have single place global module content in CMS but differently output it in different coded templates by passing param (like width_type). Though,  words 'global module' cue that it's impossible to do (as global is global and may be I can't pass different params in different places, but there are may be some tricks, because of  I didn't find any certain restrictions in HS CMS documentation to do this)? Thanks!",
