However, we're currently exploring a long-term solution for HubSpot to HubSpot sync of company records. I'll explore Supered as you suggested. Initially, we were considering HubSpot webhooks/private app, but it seems it might not be a feasible solution."

I am trying to automate copy property values to the (Newest Deal) but HubSpot allows “All deals” meaning my data would go to deals that should not have that data. Any suggestions here?
