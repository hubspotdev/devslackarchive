I have setup one dynamic page using this table as a datasource for each language but there is no way to filter the table rows as a result I now have <https://www.witty.works/en/categories/openly_discriminating> and <https://www.witty.works/en/categories/offene_diskriminierung> but the later should only be visible under <https://www.witty.works/de/kategorien/offene_diskriminierung>"
