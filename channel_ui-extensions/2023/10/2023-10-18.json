    "text": ":mega::mega::mega: Hello everyone! As part of helping you build more powerful extensions, we want to do an *Alpha of the Panel component* with about 10-15 developers.\n\n*What is a Panel?* A component that will slide open over the main page, giving you more space to present detailed information (see GIF below). It can be used to abstract information, perform data-related actions, avoid crowding the main page, and much more!\n\n*What can you expect in this Alpha?*\n• You’ll be given access to the Panel component and can play around with it as you wish. You will be committing to trying out this component\n• We expect you to provide detailed feedback within 1-2 weeks of getting access through a 20-30 minute Zoom call and active participation in this Slack channel\n*Next steps:* Please fill out <https://forms.gle/Xwiu2H3ZY8sT368FA|this form> by *27th October* if you wish to participate. We will be choosing the first 10-15 participants.",
