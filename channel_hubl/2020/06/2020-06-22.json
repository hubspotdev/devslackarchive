    "text": "I have an issue with the `groupby` filter on HubL. It says on the documentation that on the first loop, we can call on a string variable called `grouper` , or in simple terms, the title of that group.\n\nI wasn’t expecting it to return an object formatted as a string. In my case, I was expecting something like ‘Developers’, but instead it returned this:\n`{id=1, name='Developers', order=0}`\n\nIt’s important to note that it may look like an object, but this is definitely returned as a string. Any devs can help me with this?"
