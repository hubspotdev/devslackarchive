    "text": "I am seeing some strange behavior with the HubSpot global form `onFormSubmit` callback. For whatever reason, the `event.data.data` object that contains the submitted field data never has values for any hidden fields present in the form - even if the form submission contained values for the fields. I am doing everything as instructed in regard to triggering change/input events on the fields when the values are set via javascript - but no matter what they come through blank. Anyone else deal with this before?",
