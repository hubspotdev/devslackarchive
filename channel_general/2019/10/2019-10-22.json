    "text": "Hi. We are about to use a third party cookie bar to allow or disallow tracking codes. Since we are using an external system with a CMS (Typo3) I would like to use a solution inside of this system. So until people accepts cookies those are not loaded. I already have the solution but my question is about HubSpot. For Analytics etc, allowing them will fire them. But for HubSpot there's 2 solution. The first one would be to always fire the cookies when the tracking code from HubSpot is active. But then if people are not accepting HubSpot would not be loaded (for exemples the forms). Is there a way to push the optin value to HubSpot when someone click on accept? I couldn't find anything in the doc"
