The integration was built to send Xero contact data into your HubSpot account. This integration may be of interest to you.\n\nIf you have any follow-up questions or would like further clarification, please don’t hesitate to reach back out to me. I’m more than happy to help.\n\nHope you have a wonderful weekend!\n\nKindest regards,"
