And yes, I’ve checked and I’m using the same portal in VS Code and browser.\n\nEverything seems to be working fine local side, it’s just that for some reason the portal isn’t picking up the local dev env.",

Does it mean that if I don’t migrate my existing card to a React-native card, my card will no longer work ?\nI have zero experience in using React, so I’m panicking a little if it’s the case. Thanks for your help!",

Lets try to dig a little deeper if you don't mind.\n• Could you run `hs --version` and let me know what the output is?  \n• Which browser are you using?  Is it chrome?\n• In the response you get from `localhost:5173/extensions`, there is a field `callback`, in the example you provided it is `<http://hslocal.net:5173/card-frontend.js>` , could you navigate to that and let me know the output?"
