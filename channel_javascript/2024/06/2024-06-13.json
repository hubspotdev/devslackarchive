    "text": "Hi everyone, I'm running into a weird issue with a React module I've created; It uses this package `@googlemaps/markerclusterer` and I've deployed it to my HubSpot project and it loads fine. Only issue is that for a split second before client-side finishes loading this error message is rendered - `server render fail/waiting for island-9ea999i1R0 (separate island render, inside)`.\nI looked deeper and found the issue is with the markerclusterer package being a CommonJS module. Is there any way around this during the build process or possible to hide the message?\nThe full error message is:\n```Error in island components/modules/LocationMap/LocationMap.tsx?client-entry SyntaxError file:///var/task/components/LocationMap.js:4\nimport { MarkerClusterer } from \"@googlemaps/markerclusterer\";\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nSyntaxError: Named export 'MarkerClusterer' not found. The requested module '@googlemaps/markerclusterer' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.\nCommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export```\n"
