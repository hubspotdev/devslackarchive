Since it's an iframe we don't have access to the css/js files and if I try to change it with JavaScript, then CORS will cry about the domain blah blah blah and say no no lol. When I need more control over some default module I just make my own. I would just make a custom video player module and add all the CSS and JS I want in there including the play button styles."
