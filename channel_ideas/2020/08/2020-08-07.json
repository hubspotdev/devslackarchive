    "text": "You bet. Clients often want control over the order of items in a hubdb table. For example, a Team page. They may have 20 team members. They want to order the team members by seniority. It'd be fantastic if we could drag and drop the rows to control the order they display. The workaround I currently use is creating another column in hubdb with a number field called 'Order'. Then using filtering in the template to orderBy that field. However that's a bit cumbersome."
