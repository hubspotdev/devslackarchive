    "text": "Hello Everyone!  We have a little problem that could be solved with a javascript enabled page refresh, but I'm hoping someone has a more HubSpot way of doing this.   The Scenario is we have a landing page that takes in an integer value.  On submit the integer is used in a few calculated field.  OUR PROBLEM.  The thank you page should be displaying these calculated fields.  BUT the values of the calculated fields are still NULL.  We can give the page a refresh and the values show up appropriately.\n\nIs there a way to delay the thank you page's load until the contact's calculated fields have been saved?\n\n<https://offers.ipassinstitute.com/malpractice>",
