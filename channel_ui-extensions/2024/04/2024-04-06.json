    "text": "Hey! I have a question about a particular use case for a private app. I've created an extension card (by opting into the CRM Customization Beta), and a custom object. The card has the ability to create records for that custom object. I also created a custom property for the \"Company\" object and I want to update that property whenever a new custom object record is created.\n\nWhen creating the custom object record via my extension card, I can easily update the Company object via API. However, if a user creates a custom object record via the new custom object page that is created (an option in the Contacts tab of the HubSpot home page), then my private app won't know to update the Company record.\n\nMy initial thought was to use webhooks, but I realized that isn't an option due to a couple of reasons:\n1. Since I've opted into the CRM customization beta, I cannot use webhooks that private app.\n2. Webhooks can't be created to listen for events that happen on a custom object.\nThe other option I went with was to use a workflow which works well enough. My ideal scenario is that I can deploy this feature from my private app itself without creating a workflow. Does anybody have any insight that could potentially help me? Are webhooks for custom object events on the roadmap? Finally, will webhooks eventually be able to be used in private apps that are extension cards?\n\nThanks for any help everyone!",
