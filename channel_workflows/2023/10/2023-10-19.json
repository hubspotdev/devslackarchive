For example, I'd like to have the total number of deals in my account stored in a prop. Just like we can use count of deals in deals reports.\n\nI tried this with a workflow that increases by 1 my counter property for every deal known, so if there are 100 deals, this property should be equal to 100... but its not working. I feel like I'm missing something out",

Here's the issue I have:\n\nI need to create a notification for each Product [Type] = \"Print\" on a Closed Deal. One of the biggest issues so far is that I can only reference the Most Recently Created, Most Recently Updated, and First Created Line Items. So if someone creates a Quote with 6 line items, the only available data for me is the first and last items, being that they \"save\" to the deal all at once after Quote creation.\n\nOpen to ideas, I've got a lot of workflow familiarity but not much into Custom actions. Willing to try anything."
