So this will end up in a very isolated ecosystem (one theme will limit most of the CMs you can use with it).\nIs it bad?... just a different approach,not necessary bad.\nBut I believe HS vision goes on the oposite direction atm"

    "text": "<@U6GNQ7JBU> with the rapid speed of CSS and JS innovation, I think it would theoretically be a good investment on HubSpot’s end as a way to future proof your DND editor to completely move to data attributes instead of relying on the layout.css file of the day. Then again, I am not aware of the costs of this investment of resources and it might be more expensive than I’d anticipate :shrug::skin-tone-2:"
