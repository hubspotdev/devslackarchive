    "text": "Hellooo! We're having some issues with the hreflang tags HubSpot auto-generates as part of the \"standard_header_includes\" tag we put in our template.\n\n(1) It looks like it's generating 2 instances of the same hreflang tags on our <https://www.chooseoxygen.com/en/blog|blog listing> page.\n(2) The 2 instances it generated for topic listings, have different links. Example <https://www.chooseoxygen.com/en/blog/topic/crm|here>.\n(3) It's not generating any hreflang tags at all for blog posts without a language variant. Example <https://www.chooseoxygen.com/en/blog/best-cloud-accounting-technology-to-grow-revenue-and-improve-cash-flow|here>.\n\nDoes anyone know what might be causing this? And how we can fix it? I don't want to input some sort of jquery script just to correct these.",
