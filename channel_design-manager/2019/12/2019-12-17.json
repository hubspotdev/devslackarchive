    "text": ":wave: Hi Kieran!\nMost marketers and content-creators don’t want to spend time in Design Manager at all, so I’d recommend something where they can set it once and then (mostly) not go back to it. Have you tried the “Simple Menu” module? I think I’ve most often seen that one used in similar template sections where there’s a global setting, like footer. I can’t quite tell what module you’re using there, is it custom? I’ve never seen that little tree icon before."

Works the same way I’m guessing, but allows me to have different markup.\n\nThe thing I’m trying to make a decision on, is if 4 menus which will contain maybe 5 links each max, is overkill, or if that’s the way this is expected to be setup."
