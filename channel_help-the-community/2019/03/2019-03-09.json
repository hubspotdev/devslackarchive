The idea is to prevent for example sharing the direct link to the thank you page on a facebook group.\n\n<http://www.example.com/landing-page|www.example.com/landing-page>\n<http://www.example.com/thank-you-page|www.example.com/thank-you-page>\n\nIf the visitor goes to the thank you page via direct traffic, he will be redirected to the landing page."
