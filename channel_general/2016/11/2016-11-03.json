    "text": "Is there possibly a major issue with file caching in the COS. We have different people working on different files at different times, but the interface often does not show the latest file unless we do a HARD REFRESH every time. Is there a way to prevent this, i.e. a setting to never cache files? When working with multiple team members facing deadlines we do not always think that the system might be loading a cached version of the file and not the latest version. Any work arounds or recommendations out there?"
