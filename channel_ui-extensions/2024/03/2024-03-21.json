It’s a matter of challenge + creative thinking. \n\nYou can build a button that exports a PDF or CSV of data for the record you are viewing if users find it tedious to collate the data from properties. \n\nOr you can build a table that shows real time info from an external DB like Snowflake or MySQL or even a custom ERP so reps don’t need to open multiple screens to work. \n\nOr build a button to clone a record, add its associations (or clone the associations themselves) with their labels so users don’t need to re-input it.\n\nI find it easy to come up with something by reasoning ‘how can we reduce the work load for a user’. Hope this helps. "

What can I do to fix this?\nIt's not that big of a deal, but the only way I can test my projects is if I upload it every time.",

I'm guessing you are attempting to do local development on a development sandbox and uploading to a production portal? You will need your PAK to be authorized for both portals to interact with projects.\n\nI would start by confirming all the relevant portals are included when running `hs accounts list` . If not, you should use `hs auth` to request and add a new PAK for the CLI for the missing account (likely the development sandbox) and then try using `hs project dev` again."
