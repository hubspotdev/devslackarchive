    "text": "After stepping away from this for a few hours yesterday, I realized that almost all of the information I need is available via the pages API.\n\nI’m basically getting dependents backwards now.  I list all the files and then the modules they are built with, then I can sort by module to see which pages they are used in.  I also the “recipe” for each page, which is very handy.\n\nThe only piece I’m missing now is listing modules that aren’t used in any modules."
