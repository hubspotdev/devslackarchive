    "text": "Hi Bent Becker, You can access the featured image by fetching the page ID from the menu.\nImagine, you got a simple menu with just one layer, no children etc. All menus have an ID, of course. You could then simply get the menu by this ID and iterate through its nodes. By displaying the node inside your loop, you'll see an object for each node, containing things like \"url\" and also \"pageId\" (don't know why it's camelcase here). By handing this ID over to the content_by_id function you'll get the featured image. Try the following code:\n\n```{% for node in menu(&lt;your menu ID&gt;) %}\n  {{ content_by_id(node.pageId).featured_image }}\n{% endfor %}```\n"
