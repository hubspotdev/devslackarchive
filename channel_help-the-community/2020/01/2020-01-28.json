    "text": "Hey ya'll. I'm new to this slack but super happy I found it. I have some design knowledge, but I am by no means a developer (yet). I am trying to edit my blog listing page, currently it is just one long feed of all of the posts. I want it to look much cleaner, somewhat like what the actual HubSpot blog looks like. I just want it to be a bunch of different sized snippets with an image,  title, and the topic. Nothing crazy. But unfortunately I dont know a damn thing about HubL which is what I think this uses. Can someone assist/point me to the right slack channel?",

    "text": "I don't think there is necessarily a channel here that will be able to assist you with specifically what you're looking for  because it's a very generalized web development question. You'll want to look into learning CSS to style the components you've currently got on your page. That can be done within your modules (there is a CSS Pane to enter custom CSS) if you are using that or in your drag and drop templates. You can learn more about that here. <https://blog.HubSpot.com/customers/ways-to-style-website-pages>"
