    "text": "Hi everyone. New here. Working on a project for a client and a little new to webdev to be honest so bear with me. I am trying to get my search features on the website to pull results only from one of my blogs at a time. So if the user is signed in and searching from the signed in page, I want them to only pull information from the members only blog. If they have not signed up, then only pull info from the non members blog located on the outside of the membership sign in wall. \n\nI have tried custom modules and custom search results pages to no avail. Any ideas would be great!  \n\nAlso Iâ€™m not sure if this is the right place for this question. I also placed it in modules. Sorry if this is the wrong place!"

The initial email is sent fine, but when the customer clicks to verify his email address the email confirmation never shows up. They have checked spam, junk, waiting 10 minutes, etc. I've found this works sometimes and not works other times. My Sales team doesn't want to use HubSpot for E-Signatures due to this.\n\nHas anyone found a similar issue, or know of a fix?"

For a given Contact, we might do a personalized event (take them to coffee, give them a book we think they'd like, etc) and/or a campaign event (ie, every new customer gets the same thank-you gift after their first order, key accounts might get the same special gift at new years, etc)\n\nThe ideal version would allow us to capture multiple events for one contact (some events would be allowed only once, some multiple times), with this data captured for each:\ndate\nevent category\nevent quick desc\nNotes\nDeal ID that was created as a response to that event\n\nWe've considered using Line Items, because we could have multiple (open-ended) items, with pre-configured column options for them (date, etc).\n\nBUT, this is an obvious mis-use of the Line Items tool AND those are not directly hooked onto Contacts, but Deals.\n\nAny ideas for how to create a Contact data structure that's richer than just a few properties?"
