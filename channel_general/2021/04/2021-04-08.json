    "text": "Hello Folks,\nI am going to use HubSpot data in Power BI, by building some reports for Deal, Companies and Contacts objects.\nIt seems there is no power BI connector for HubSpot. Instead, I will use HubSpot API to Pull up the HubSpot data to server/local computer, then process and import the data to Power BI to build reports. Is this good idea or is there better idea somewhere that I am not aware of?"

    "text": "I'm new to HubSpot and found the forms offerings quite confusing. I wanted to have form data on a website go into HubSpot. Firstly I came across the form builder but to have truly custom, raw HTML and CSS forms with that requires the Marketing Pro Plan (\"Set as raw HTML form\" switch under \"Style &amp; preview\" tab), but later I found the developer API Forms API that (at least the legacy API) allows external raw HTML and CSS forms to submit data to HubSpot on ANY account, including the free account. What's the difference here? Is the legacy API going to be phased out?",
