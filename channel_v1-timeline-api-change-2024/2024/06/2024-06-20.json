It's true that the Conversations API doesn't allow 'adding channels or creating threads' - turns out that's because we'd always planned a complementary API for just that. The Custom Channels API is now in private beta with a few initial partners.\n\nI've seen a lot of interest (unsurprisingly) in 'bring your own chatbot to HubSpot' and different people have found different ways to do it with different degrees of success. I'm curious, Sten, in your case\n1. if the conversations are happening over a channel you 'own' or if you are just wanting to bring 'your GPT' to a HubSpot-maintained channel like live chat or email\n2. what your ideal user flow is from customers interacting with the GPT to (possibly) humans getting involved in the converastion. Is HubSpot just for after-the-fact storage or is it a tool as part of this customer service expeirence?"
