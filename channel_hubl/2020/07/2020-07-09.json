This is pretty misleading since doing the same thing in the HTML + HubL area properly treats that as a HubL Comment and omits it from the frontend. Can this be corrected so any HubL comments within the module.js area is treated the same way and doesn't render on the frontend or is it possible for the syntax formatting to be adjusted so it doesn't make it look like it will be treated as a comment? I'm not sure if this is a recent issue or if it has been this way forever.",
