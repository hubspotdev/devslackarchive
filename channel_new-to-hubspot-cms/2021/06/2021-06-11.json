    "text": "Howdy all, new to this slack and fairly new to HS. I have a question and do not know what tag to put in. We have customized deal properties, one of which is native HS and the other is an import from Salesforce. Without getting in the actual code of the customization, is there a way to remove 2 deal \"type\" properties from forecast management? The native HS deal property says it cannot be edited or deleted because of its native-ness. the other only has 2 items attached to it, a workflow and a report, but it also wont let me use the property because the name is the same as the native property. i cant delete it either. I feel it has legacy data in it and is throwing off my reports. Any ideas?",
