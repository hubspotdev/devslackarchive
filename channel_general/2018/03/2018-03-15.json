If you start to move staging, hubdb etc externally and give it away for free I think you would see a sharp drop off in people purchasing those and as developers we have to then ask clients to buy these tools which do not benefit the client but benefit us instead. I think its fine the way it is and that these one cases are a small portion and there isnt concern"
