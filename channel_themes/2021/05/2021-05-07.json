Cloned themes are not child or subthemes of the master so every file has been copied to the clone whether any modification has been made to it or not.",

The UI will let you go in, select the child theme, select the template, but then the DONE button is visibly clickable but does nothing.\n\n<https://www.loom.com/share/3b98dc9ebb0a45ec93abd6aecf2d3f6d>",
