    "text": "I was looking for this as well.  You can't include the HubSpot image_slider_gallery or a dnd_area within a custom module. I use css grids and flex objects to create columns in my modules, but that's a workaround and not a good long-term solution because you are then removing the dnd_area capability.  So, you are left with deciding whether to forgo responsiveness for portrait tablet mode to have dnd capability or give up dnd capability for responsiveness."
