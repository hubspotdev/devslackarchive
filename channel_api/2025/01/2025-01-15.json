Our Laravel application enables these data to be transferred to our HubDB on the HubSpot platform and displayed on a dynamic page within our HubSpot application.\nHowever, we want to simplify this process by creating a more efficient and straightforward API, completely removing the Laravel platform. In this case, would you recommend using Firebase or Xano? The key requirement is that the data should automatically appear in our HubDB, and any changes the client makes in their database should be immediately synchronized and reflected on our side.\nThank you in advance for your suggestion!"

The issue is that eBay never includes the customer’s email or phone number—only an eBay ID. Because of this, I created a custom property in HubSpot contacts called “Ebay ID,” and whenever I receive a message from eBay, I use that eBay ID to create or update a contact in HubSpot.\nWhen sending the message to HubSpot, I set:\n```json\n\n\n\"deliveryIdentifier\": {\n  \"type\": \"CHANNEL_SPECIFIC_OPAQUE_ID\",\n  \"value\": \"&lt;eBay ID&gt;\"\n}```\nHowever, HubSpot isn’t automatically matching these conversations with the existing contact who has the same “Ebay ID” value.\nCould you please let me know how I can *automatically* associate a conversation with the correct contact in my custom channel? I’ve tried multiple approaches through the API, but none have been successful so far. Any guidance or best practices for this scenario would be extremely helpful.\nThank you in advance for your support!",
