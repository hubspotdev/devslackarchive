    "text": ":wave: hi Dana, I can offer a little bit of clarity here. We didn't change anything specifically related to the modules themselves lately, but we did find a very small subset of portals that were in a weird state where the default HubSpot modules were editable. This wasn't intentional, and we've been working to clean those up so this may have been what you saw. The infrastructure around those default modules means that we can deploy bug fixes and version updates to them quickly, but if they were customisable those changes we make would blow away any customisations you'd made. It's a necessary part of the default modules unfortunately but you can clone them inside of Design Manager and make versions that suit specific needs as an alternative too. Let me know if I can help out at all."

    "text": ":faceplam: out of interest AJ, does that padding hang around when you send the email? We're pulling apart some of the padding customisations inside of the drag and drop editor at the moment and there's a small amount of padding that's added _just_ within the editor itself to help provide some spacing for module buttons/hover states, but it's not included in the actual email that gets sent out. We're working on alternative solutions for this, it's misleading and we don't like it"
