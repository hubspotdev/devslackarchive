You can now RSVP for INBOUND community center events like the one happening on <https://app.HubSpot.com/connect-beta/community/22091/events/756|Thursday, Sept 19> from 2:15 PM - 3:45 PM starring <@U03AKL6Q1B2> <@U03REFNRMB3> <@UJAPS2K4N> and <@U01QVR44MEY> right on <http://Connect.com|Connect.com>! I should point out that RSVPing doesn't guarantee you a spot - we still suggest showing up early, but it does give us a really helpful signal for demand, AND allows you to add it to your calendar! <https://app.HubSpot.com/connect-beta/community/22091/events/756>"
