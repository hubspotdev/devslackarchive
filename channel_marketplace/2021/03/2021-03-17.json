    "text": "Hi Everyone, the marketplace guidelines state that themes are rejected if modules / themes only have too much in common / show only small differentiations. While i can totally understand and support that decision, i am really struggling to understand at what point is a module / template “different enough” to be counted as a separate entity to not get rejected, cause it would be nice to have a foundation of code to be used in a couple of themes (that can also be maintained easier) and just have the “differentiators” on a module /template level."
