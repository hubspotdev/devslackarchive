The problem with the public app is that with the upcoming change, a redirect URL will be required. The URLs are not known upfront however.\nWhat would you recommend? Using a private app and create credentials for each installation of the integration or create a public app?",

I see all the documentation on object default properties but I’d like lists for calls/emails/meetings/tasks etc :thinking_face:  any help would be appreciated! Seems support gets confused and just sends me links to the objects….if i can search the CRM for engagements….would be super helpful to see the default properties for those. :eyes:",
