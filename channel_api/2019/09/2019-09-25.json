Only after some time do I get the new values.\n\nThe call I use to get the contact is\n\n<https://api.hubapi.com/contacts/v1/contact/vid/1/profile?propertyMode=value_only&amp;formSubmissionMode=newest>\n\n\nWhen I make the call through Postman I can see the new values directly.\n\nAny idea what is going on here?\n\n\nDo you have any idea what is going on? I already tried to add the Cache-Control=no-cache header, but that didn't make any difference."
