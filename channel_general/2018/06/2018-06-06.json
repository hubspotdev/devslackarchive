That file isn't actually a static file hosted on a CDN, it's dynamically generated for every unique visitor for each individual CTA to build in the right versions or a/b variation for them (i.e. if you and I visit the same page with the same CTA on it, we'll both be served a different loader-v2.js file with our unique version of the CTA in it. For this reason, it's not minified because it'd be an extra step we'd need to take before serving the loader-v2.js file on every request, and since the file is gzipped before being transmitted it should be pretty small to begin with. Out of interest, is it the case that it's something a service like Pagespeed Insights highlighted or was it just something you came across?"
