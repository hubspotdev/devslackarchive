    "text": "Hello <#C2YHAHB6K|api>, I'm a developer at DxFactor, currently working on developing CRM Cards on HubSpot to display user's check-in data, transactions and products. Currently, HubSpot allows to view atmost 5 records and gives a action button of type Iframe to view those records in IFrame; this Iframe option is only available for all those 5 records. In my Case, I want to have action button at the end of 5 records of each CRM Cards, which is a ViewAllItemsLink, which upon clicking, should display rest of the records other than those 5, in iFrame. So, Essentially, I want to display records in IFrame (popup display) in CRM Cards while I click on viewAllItems link. So far, I have gone through the documentation (<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/crm-extensions/crm-extensions-overview>) but I cant find anything related to showing up for IFRAMES upon clicking the viewAllItems link. Currently, HubSpot allows adding iFrames to each records but my requirement is to have only one iFrame button and that too at the end of of 5 records. I tried creating seperate action button in my response which upon clicking should show data in Iframes (popup display) but that too not being displayed on HubSpot. Please assist.",
