    "text": "Hello!\n\nWe are planning to list our app in the marketplace and we have a few questions.\n• The main functionality of the App is to sync contacts from our platform to a connected Huspot account. Part of the listing  requirements is that the app must use webhooks privacy-compliant contact deletions. What do we need to do if contact deletion has been requested from HubSpot ? Is it required to delete the contacts from our platform as well ? I’m asking this question because those contacts originate from our platform and not HubSpot.\n• What behavior is required by the reviewers upon installation of the app ? Should we return back to HubSpot ? or is it ok to stay in our platform ?\n",
