    "text": "Thanks for taking the time to respond Nicholas. No issues with database storage. This relates to JavaScript runtime engines and limitations of the `number` data type.\n\nNo need to respond further however in case you are interested, in the version 1 APIs the vid is a JSON number (see <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/get_contact_by_email|here> - notice how, in the JSON example, there are no \"quotes\" around the vid property). You are quite right that most of the v3 APIs, as shown in your examples, do present the IDs as strings. There are a few that present the IDs as numbers (for example: the Marketing Events Subscriber State Changes, API docs <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/marketing/marketing-events|here>, one endpoint is this *`/marketing/v3/marketing-events/events/{externalEventId}/{subscriberState}/upsert`*\n)\n\nI have passed this question through to our HubSpot account rep, will update here once I get an answer in case others are impacted by / interested in this."
