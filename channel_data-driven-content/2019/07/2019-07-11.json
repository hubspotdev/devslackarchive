So 10 rows can only be called at one time and use the \"Limit\" and \"Offset\" parameters to limit the number of results that populate at one time on a page? Why on this page then, with 31 rows/results shown at one time, am I only 4 over the allowed 10 per page (according to the source code)? <https://www.alignex.com/upcoming-training>",
