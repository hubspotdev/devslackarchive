    "text": "Hi, I need to integrate our cloud telephony app with HubSpot crm. I have created the app and run the calling extension sdk in local and successfully installed the app in test account. If I am not wrong, the next step is to customize the sdk according to our integration needs, right? Are there any particular rules or guidelines or structures to follow ? orelse, can we modify it on our own ways? Can somebody help me with this?"
