    "text": "Hi, everyone!\n\nI’m looking for a freelance HubSpot API developer for a big integration project. There will be a discovery phase to the project where the developer will need to engage directly with the client to see what’s possible and what licences and API access they have for their platforms that they wish to integrate with HubSpot.\n\nHere is a list of the platforms they have and would be looking to potentially integrate:\n\n- SAP S4 (ERP)\n- SAP SAC (Analytics Cloud)\n- Easypay (Customer loyalty program)\n- Cisco - IVR (SAM)\n- Ipsos (mystery shopper system - B2C)\n- Steele Interface - (risk management solution -  part of customer approval process)\n- Becran Interface (anti corruption check - part of customer approval process)\n- Infopbip / Whathub - SMS and Whatsapp\n- Power BI\n\nThe discovery phase will determine which of these platforms can be integrated and to what extent, as well as what data will need to be sent to HubSpot and to which objects (tickets/deals,etc).\n\nStrong communication skills in English will be required for the client facing part of the project :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nIf anyone is interested or knows anyone who would be a good fit, please drop me a DM.\n\nTimezone isn’t a deal breaker, but client meetings will be in GMT +2 (South Africa)\n\nThanks!",
