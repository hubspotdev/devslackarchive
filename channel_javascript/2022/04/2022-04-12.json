    "text": "Hey everyone, I want to use a cta for tracking if a card was displayed and clicked. A Vue app is rendering cards into and out of the DOM as filters are selected. The cta should track if a card is clicked without redirecting to the ctas url. Also the the view of the cta should be tracked anytime it is rendered into the dom.\nI was thinking to use the embedded code to implement this. Do you have any ideas for a possible solution?\nThanks",
