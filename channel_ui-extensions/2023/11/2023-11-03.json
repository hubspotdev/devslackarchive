    "text": "In addition, I think adding an `onClick` to the following components is the way to go.\n\n1) Table (head, row, body, cell, header, footer)\n2) Description List\n3) Progress bar\n4) StatisticsItem\n5) Tile\n\nUsers are used to being able to either tap or click on a component on their screen to carry out some action. It will be nice to give this to them because of the smooth flow of use. I have a table I am populating from a 3rd party source, and I have to put a button at the end to ‘show more’. The platform we are moving from allowed users simply click the row to ‘show more’. "

    "text": "<@U03FJQPSC0Y> great meeting you today. As I mentioned, we started building our own Figma components library against what we’re finding in the docs/app. We might be open to sharing with the community depending on what you guys have planned, and your timing. Any color you can give on that?\ncc: <@U0616TTM53R>"
