    "text": "Hi all! We finished our HubSpot app and have our first customers using it. We have UI Extensions and custom workflow actions. The thing is, one of our customers can't see our Utopian Labs custom actions in their workflow builder.\n• They have full access/admin rights\n• They can see the UI Extensions, so the app is successfully installed\n• They have other third-party apps with workflow steps that are visible in the workflow builder\n• Our app is not verified yet \n• All other customers, including ourselves, have no problem using the workflow actions\n• Re-installing the app didn't solve this\nHas anyone experienced this as well? And if so, how did you solve it? Thanks in advance!",
