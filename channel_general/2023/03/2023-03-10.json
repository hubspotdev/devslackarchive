We've managed to do the same with the HubSpot widget, and we have set it up so that the widget loads by default but doesn't open by default. We have also made use of the `unreadConversationCountChanged` event field to auto-open the chat when a message has been received and not yet seen; however, this only works to open the chat when the message is sent from the conversations inbox, not from a chatflow.\n\nWe want to be able to auto-open the chat when any message (including a new chatflow message) is waiting, does anyone have any suggestions, or any experience doing something similar?"

(Noting that i can' find the phone number personalization for HubSpot users, most probably doesn't exist).\n\nWhat would be the best way to have the phone number of the user assigned in the property \"Deal owner\" stored inside the deal itself?\nIf deal owner is X, display X's phone number in a field on the deal.\n\nWe have a big list of people that can be set as deal owners, Not feasible to do through workflow if branches as it will take ages and a lot of maintenance as we go forward.\n\nThanks!",
