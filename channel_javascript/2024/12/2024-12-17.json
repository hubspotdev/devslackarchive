    "text": "Hello! I am trying to manually trigger an integration from a Private App in HubSpot that is normally triggered when a contact registers on our website. We have a group of contacts that gave us their information and need to be manually registered, which when we do that, does not trigger this integration and leaves out key appended data. I'm thinking that the best way to do this is through custom code in a workflow, but I'm pretty new to javascript and am unsure how to write out the code correctly.\n\nEssentially, I need to run the integration and pull in several properties onto the contact record. Any suggestions on where I could start with that? Thank you!",
