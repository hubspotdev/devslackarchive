    "text": "Hi everyone, I wonder if anybody could help with an issue we are experiencing within the HubDB please. We have set up a new table and have a column with a 'Number' column type.\n\nWithin this column we are trying to enter '0' in selected rows but this value is not being accepted - it is just being cleared out. Any other value is saved without issues.\n\nIs there a global setting that needs to be adjusted somewhere to resolve this?\n\nMany thanks, Chris",
