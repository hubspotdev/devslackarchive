    "text": "This is an interesting question.  I’ve only built mult-lingual websites using European languages, so I haven’t had to switch the fonts based on language.\n\nIf I had to, I think I would just set it at the template level.  I tend to build different page templates for all my languages so I can have headers/footers hard coded in the specific languages, so I would probably just load my fonts there and then add a class to the body to style elements based on the language."
