    "text": "Thanks for reaching out. Though this is getting close to the upper limit we like to see for approval wait times it is still within what we consider a reasonable timeframe. Though I can not guarantee your assets will be reviewed “today”, given the time they have been in the queue I would not be surprised to see you assets reviewed within the next week.\n\nIt is worth noting that approval queue volume is variable and we can not guarantee consistent and predictable wait times. We are working to get better at this and will have a couple plays in place in 2019 which we hope will help ease the wait times.\n\nYour patience is greatly appreciated!"
