I've heard that Skyvia could be an option, but when I tested it, I couldn't find my hubdb tables within the backup. But maybe I'm just blind and can't see it? :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI know that I can export the table rows manually from within HubSpot. But I am looking for an automatic backup/restore solution that preferably will handle creation/deletion of table columns/structure as well."
