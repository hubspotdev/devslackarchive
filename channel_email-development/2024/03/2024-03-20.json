Even if you are able to set Arial as the default font, it won’t load on Android phones or iPhones which is likely to be a significant portion of your database. And the platforms where it _could_ load are going to load the default sans-serif font instead. Which in some instances might be Arial, but even when it’s not, it’s practically an Arial look-alike to most users."
