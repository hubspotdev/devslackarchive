    "text": "The best way to create a new header is to create a so-called <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/cms/content/templates/types/html-hubl-templates#global-partials|global partial> in your theme. Doing so will let you edit the content of it with ease (especially if you're using default and/or custom modules within).\nYou can check out the default themes that are located in the `<@UDA553DRD>`  folder inside the Design-Manager or create a new theme based on the <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate|cms boilerplate>.\n\nTo create a new theme based on the boilerplate open the design-manager, open \"File\", select \"New theme\" and select \"Boilerplate\" as your starting point.\nTip: While there are no limitations in the theme name, I recommend you to either choose a single word or - if you have multiple words, replace the \"space\" with a dash \"-\" or underscore \"_\"",

    "text": "Once you've created the theme, open the templates/partials folder and look at the existing files.\nSince it's the boilerplate it provides you a good starting point.\n\nAlso: If you're just starting with themes, I highly recommend you to do the <https://academy.HubSpot.com/courses/cms-for-developers|HubSpot CMS for Developers Certification> in the Academy. This will give you a better understanding of themes and how the work"
