It’s pretty common when the HS team wants to get people to test out new features and whatnot they either broadcast it in the slack channels, or occasionally direct message people they’ve felt have given good feedback in the past. I have also gotten direct emails from some of the HS team in this slack(usually invites to weigh in on something or to an event).\n\nI also attended a Chicago HubSpot User Group last month which was pretty great, <@U6GNQ7JBU> gave a great presentation about everything HubSpot is doing to improve performance for HS sites, and some of the awesome things developers will get to take advantage of.\n\nI would say largely this slack is the best place for info. <@U22PKFRU5> has been talking about doing a developer blog, with email subscriptions."
