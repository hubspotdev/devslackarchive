I'm sharing an Autonomous Inbox and CRM Assistant app that leverages generative AI to intelligently manage your sales inbox and HubSpot CRM, auto-draft replies using your sales playbook & company branding, and integrates with Gmail and HubSpot. It is source available, runs on Pipedream and integrates via a custom HubSpot app. <https://github.com/jacob-dietle/Autonomous-Sales-Inbox-and-CRM-Assistant|You can check out it and clone a version of it here>. Any feedback is appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:"
