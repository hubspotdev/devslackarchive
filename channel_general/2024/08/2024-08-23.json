If you have multiple companies with the same domain you can import using Record ID instead of company domain name. First find the record ID from the company in HubSpot then import the contacts mapping to the record ID instead of company domain name <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/import-and-export/import-objects>"

One of them is to export the companies, and then align them in Google Sheets with a VLOOKUP and then attaching the ID to the Contact record and importing. Then you have the full control what you’re importing and how you associate. But there are other techniques as well."

This can help if you have multiple nested companies and don't want to go through setting them all up separately or in clusters.\n\nLittle bit of extra work at the beginning but certainly helpful if you're dealing with larger enterprise and investment type firms that have a couple dozen mini-me companies! :slightly_smiling_face:"
