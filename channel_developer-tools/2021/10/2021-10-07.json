My HubSpot are linked to my Salesforce account, but when a opportunity goes Closed Lost in the Salesforce, it become impossible for the same contact to make another simulation in the HubSpot side, it throws the `Contact ID: id value of incorrect type: : INVALID_ID_FIELD` whenever I try to sync. There is any workaround for this issue?  Thanks!"
