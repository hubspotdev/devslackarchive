I keep getting pulled in a fair amount of directions today and hadn’t had time to give enough of a detailed look.\n\nWhat I was able to get in the time I’ve had to look at it is that Total Blocking Time is the area of biggest improvement. Which basically does indeed amount to javascript primarily.\n\nThere are indeed a fair amount of tracking scripts, including it looked like there may be more than 1 Google Tag manager script (it showed in page speed insights, didn’t look in the HTML by hand). Tracking scripts are often heavy culprits in TBT -  which makes sense: To work all of these analytics scripts set up a ton of event handlers that every time an event fires that they’re interested in, each of these scripts separately has JavaScript run to log and handle that event."
