    "text": "I've been struggling with this problem for years, the only solution I can think of (wich is kind of hard to maintain) is to create another table like \"Language variants\" with a column for each language (like \"EN\", \"FR\", \"IT\", etc) and then create (or update) a custom language switcher that if you are in a dynamic page you search for a row in that language column that matches that page path (so for example, I'm in the italian version of the page /page-url, so I look for a row where IT column equals /page-url, and then use the other column as language switcher variants (and also add them as hreflang tags in the page head)"
