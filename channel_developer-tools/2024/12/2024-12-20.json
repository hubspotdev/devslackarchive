    "text": "*Hello everyone!*\n\nI’m working with HubSpot CRM, and as many of you know, “line items” represent our company’s products within the platform. However, I noticed there is no native functionality to create sub-products for line items, and I’m currently looking for a way to work around this limitation.\nI’d love to know if anyone here has encountered this issue and found a solution or an interesting approach to creating sub-products or related products for line items. I’m considering using custom fields or even workflows to link sub-products to main line items, but I haven’t found the best way to do it yet.\nIf anyone has any suggestions or experiences to share, I’d really appreciate the help!\n\nBest regards to everyone!"
