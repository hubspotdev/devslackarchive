My use case is we have a drawer that opens up that reveals one of several forms. Our marketing team would like to be able to use any button in any module to be able to open that drawer and select a form. I can get that working perfectly with a select field, but I’m worried that doing this across all buttons is going to be rather rigid when it comes time to make a change."

Some of our clients feeds drop and all that needs to be done is chucking a box on a library dashboard someplace. It’s a real easy fix but also a pain. \n\nMight not be the case for you though. Like Jon said it really depends on how it’s all built!"
