    "text": "<!here> - We are releasing a couple new features to the new Design Manager and are looking for alpha testers. The two new features are, 1. Allowing users to edit legacy Custom Modules without upgrading in the new Design Manager, 2. Relaxed validation (most notably HubL functions `include`, `import`, and `get_public_template_url`) to make your development easier. If this sounds like something you want to use before the larger release please fill out this form and we will release these alpha features to you: <https://goo.gl/forms/4XIz0duDmbK3bI2k2>",
