    "text": "When looping through items within a Simple HubSpot menu that are set to \"Page Link\" or \"Page Link with URL Parameter\", the `linkUrl` attribute is `null` even if the page is published. In order to get the actual URL we have to use `content_by_id` or `contents_by_id`. But, based on the documentation, only 10 of these functions can be used on a page and I need this to work for any number of menu items. I must be doing something wrong here or the `linkUrl` attribute is broken, so what is the correct way to get the URL of \"Page Link\" menu items in a Simple Menu while looping through them?\n\nThis is what the attributes for a \"Page Link\" menu item looks like:\n```{isPublished=true, pageLinkId=11111111, pageLinkName=Sample, isDeleted=null, categoryId=1, subCategory=site_page, contentType=site_page, state=PUBLISHED_OR_SCHEDULED, linkLabel=Sample, linkUrl=null, linkParams=null, linkTarget=null, type=PAGE_LINK, children=[]}```\nCompare this to a \"URL Link\" which has this structure where the `linkUrl` attribute is as entered in the menu:\n```{isPublished=false, pageLinkId=null, pageLinkName=null, isDeleted=null, categoryId=null, subCategory=null, contentType=null, state=null, linkLabel=Sample Link, linkUrl=#, linkParams=null, linkTarget=null, type=URL_LINK, children=[]}```"
