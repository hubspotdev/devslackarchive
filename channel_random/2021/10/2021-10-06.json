Let me know any possible improvements and general feedback about this theme, thank you all!\n\nAnd this is a community made theme, and not an official HubSpot made thing, feel free to join us on <https://github.com/DreamDevourer/Enhanced-HubSpot-VScode-Theme|GitHub> for improving it even more and keeping it updated.",
