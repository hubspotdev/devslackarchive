I can’t find any patterns as to why it shows up as this little graphic in random browsers, on random machines, every so often. Has anyone run into this before? It’s supposed to be a full-width, live-text cta with a background image. Turning off JS doesn’t affect anything. In the attached screens, A is how it is supposed to (usally) looks, and B is the little graphic that is getting served up sometimes.",
