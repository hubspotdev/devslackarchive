We have a use-case where we leverage a HubDB to allow to group blog tags within an additional level of categories. It is currently a bit bloated with all the HubDBs for language variants, etc.\nSo it would be great to be able to use this new functionality or even better =&gt; if blog tags would get one extra level of depth :slightly_smiling_face:"
