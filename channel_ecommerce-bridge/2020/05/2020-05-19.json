I am working on a BigCommerce integration with our existing HubSpot account that was set up as a custom integration by an external development team.  I am sure I will have a few questions and look forward to e-meeting everyone!"

We are in the middle of a website replatform to BigCommerce from a custom rails app and I am using this plug in but I was not able to set it up in my HubSpot sandbox environment.  I could not get the plugin to connect.  So I was considering setting our BigCommerce integration that has the active plugin in up as a secondary domain in HubSpot.  However it seems to indicate that I need to upgrade to choose a new domain but we have an enterprise account ."
