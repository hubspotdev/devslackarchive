Without this, we are doing double work, with loss of time for deadlines, and a hirer chance of error trying to implement changes made in the Sandbox.\n\nHereâ€™s the link to UPVOTE: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Ability-to-choose-sync-direction-between-HubSpot-Sandboxes-and/idi-p/542037/highlight/true|https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Ability-to-choose-sync-direction-between-HubSpot-Sandboxes-and/idi-p/542037/highlight/true>",
