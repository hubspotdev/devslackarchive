    "text": "Hey all! My company recently signed up for the CMS professional account. I've been going through the \"Key Concepts\" documentation learning everything I can about the CMS (I've found some discrepancies, but that's another topic).\nThe documentation only gives like 3 exercises for developers to practice referencing HubDB.\nAre there any other practice exercises out there? We have this new platform and I'm excited to use the sandbox account to learn! But, not sure what all I can challenge myself with using the HubL language, referencing APIs, HubDB, etc.\nAny ideas or channels for this?\nAnyone out there with more experience that can throw a challenge my way so I can learn? LOL!",

    "text": "Hi Tracy, regarding HubDB here are the tutorials/guides we have available:\n• <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/building-dynamic-pages-with-hubdb|Build dynamic pages with HubDB>\n• <https://designers.HubSpot.com/tutorials/how-to-join-hubdb-tables|How to join multiple HubDB tables>\n• <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tutorials/how-to-build-a-dynamic-team-member-page-with-hubdb|How to build a dynamic team member page with HubDB>\n• <https://designers.HubSpot.com/how-to-add-videos-to-dynamic-pages-in-hubdb|How to add videos to dynamic pages>\n• <https://designers.HubSpot.com/how-to-build-multilevel-dynamic-templates|How to build multilevel dynamic pages using HubDB>\n• <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tutorials/lets-build-a-page-with-a-map-with-hubdb|Let's build a page with a map using HubDB>\n\nIn general the best exercises to learn a new platform are to build something that interests you. Even if that thing isn’t going to be used for your work.\n\nSome examples, you could build out a game that involves all of the technology you want to learn. You could build a little app that might make part of your job easier.\n\nIf you don’t mind I would love to hear about the discrepancies you found in the key concepts doc, so we can improve it."

    "text": "Hi <@U7SL518D6> thanks for responding. Yeah, that's a good idea, I can do that for sure. I did tackle the above examples!\nI'll go back through my notes and find the exact spots, but in general, the discrepancies are almost as if a specific section of a document was updated but the update contradicts the previous/following steps.\nI found myself searching how to put the pieces together to complete the exercise to fit the update or making additional notes to myself for the missing puzzle pieces."
