    "text": "Hi guys, have a question related to routing.\nI have one base partial which includes header, and, i use it in all my pages and blog pages.\nBut the question is, I don`t know how to implement classic behavior for header logo. If i will make default reference to index page,\n```&lt;a href=\"/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;```\nIt will lead to different domains from page and blog pages (<http://blog.company.com|blog.company.com> and to <http://company.com|company.com>).\nThe problem that I don`t want to paste there absolute path, because of testing purposes.\nAppreciate for your help.",
