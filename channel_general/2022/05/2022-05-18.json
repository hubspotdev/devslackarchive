    "text": "Hey guys, need to discuss the possibility of a technical solution. Really appreciate any help here:\n\n*The Problem:*\nWe have 5 sales sequences set up in sales hub. We have a workflow which triggers once a contact enrolls to one of the sequences. We want to enroll them randomly into another sequence from the 5 sequences once they finish the first sequence.\n\n1. Is there a way to accomplish this in workflows\n2. Is there a way to know a contact has finished a sequence, like a trigger or property ??"
