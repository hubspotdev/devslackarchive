    "text": "<@UJJ239SC9> - Essentially we've just always had functionality in our app that users could update HubSpot contact properties from the client-side by leveraging the identify method HubSpot provides.\n\nSo as the most simple example:\n```var _hsq = window._hsq = window._hsq || [];\n     _hsq.push(['identify', {\n       email: '<mailto:email@test.com|email@test.com>',\n       color: 'Red'\n      }]);\n_hsq.push(['trackPageView']);```\nThis would update the `color` property for contact with email `<mailto:email@test.com|email@test.com>` to be \"Red\".\n\nIs there no similar way to do this any longer with that deprecation?"

    "text": "• Unsure on timing question\n• I think there are 2 main reasons (I don't work in HubSpot Product, so these are my own takes):\n    ◦ likelihood of abuse and the possibilities of rate limiting was more limited (i.e. theoretically, I could drop JS into the console when browsing your website, iterate over presumed email addresses, create contacts or overwrite existing data just by defining the property names and values. The Forms API has more checks (i.e. you can only write data into fields that are defined on the HubSpot Form that you're writing to, not any possible contact property))\n    ◦ this was relatively in conjunction with new custom events that allow for property capture (so, you'r sending event completion properties instead of contact properties)"
