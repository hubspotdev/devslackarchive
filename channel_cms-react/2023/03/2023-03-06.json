    "text": "Like calculating some positions or widths in the components, because we are rendering stuff on the server we don’t have dom yet. How the component knows when it’s rendered and have dom to use? I can see that there are some props like:\n``` hydrateOn: HydrationType;\n clientOnly: boolean;```\ncan these help or could I give to components some prop like `rendered` so the components state can check when to initialise dom stuff."
