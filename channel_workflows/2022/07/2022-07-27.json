    "text": "The way a Workflow is \"triggered\" (to determine WHEN it runs) is done through those enrollment triggers. Right now it uses property changes. For example, if your goal was to send a welcome email to ALL contacts as soon as they're created, you could simply use a trigger like \"Contact first name `is known`\". This will enroll every Contact with a first name _after_ you enable the Workflow"
