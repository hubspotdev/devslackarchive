I'm trying to find a way to update paragraph font-size without having to go into the source-code and manually edit all the font-size CSS attributes one by one. So far I've tried adding an additional HTML code snippet in blog settings but it doesn't do anything....Thanks!",

    "text": "Hi all, I'm creating a carousel of recent posts and I'm using css and flexbox to 'grow/shrink' the size of my post containers on hover. The issue I'm having is that I need to add a containing div around 3 posts at a time. Is there a way to do this within the posts loop? My container ends up wrapping every post. Would I do this with loop.index or is there another way to make this happen? Basically I need to be able to say - for every 3 posts, add this container around those posts"
