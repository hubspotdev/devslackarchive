For some context — I think that the way that this was originally designed, im not 100%, but I believe it was originally intended to simply inherit default values that were set on the target field. Ie. `field_1` has a default value of `blue` --&gt; `field_2` inherits from `field_1` ergo it’s value is `blue`. I don’t think that they were originally designed to be in a watchful state for page editor updates."
