    "text": "Hello everyone,\nI am working on developing a blog that should have a structure similar to HubSpot's marketing blog, for example: <https://blog.HubSpot.com/marketing|HubSpot Marketing Blog>.\nOne thing I find puzzling is that HubSpot blogs account for the first pagination page being the same as the listing page. This is not something I want, and HubSpot's own blog doesn't operate this way either. The first page on their blog is a completely custom listing page that doesn't care how many blog posts there are and doesn't account for pagination. Plus, at the bottom, you have the option to go to page 1 where there's pagination and a simpler template. This is precisely what I'm aiming for.\nHowever, I haven't found any straightforward and clean variables to use to achieve this. HubSpot doesn't seem to allow differentiation between the blog listing and pagination pages, and for some reason, I also have a default page 0, which I have no idea what it's for.\nThe only way I can think of replicating HubSpot's behavior is by using an 'if' statement on the blog listing HTML page and matching it with the exact path of the listingâ€”so for example, 'website/blog'. This way, it would display what I want without counting the listing page as page 1. I'm not fond of this solution, and I'm certain there's a better way. Yet when I look at HubSpot's blog, it seems like they've done just that; they also have an unused page 0: <https://blog.HubSpot.com/marketing/page/0|HubSpot Marketing Blog Page 0>, which is identical to page 1.\nIs there a cleaner way to accomplish this?",
