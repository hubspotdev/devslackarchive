    "text": "Hi <@U064S83EWAV>, <@U049DFUK1RB> is right. When we announced sunset back in September, we allowed customers to continue the cards usage while they were converting them to React so end users are not impacted. But now since we are nearing the timeline of 6 months heads up for sunset, we are taking extra measures to make sure the sunset is noticed by all customers. \n\nWe have a lot of resources to help you build cards with react based cards. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/crm-customization|https://developers.HubSpot.com/crm-customization> is a perfect place to start. And this vibrant community is also here to help."
