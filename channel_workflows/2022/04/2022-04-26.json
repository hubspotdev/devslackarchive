    "text": "Ah, gotcha. We’ve heard the need for better control of rate limits with custom code from customers before. Unfortunately at this point there’s no way to manually configure maximum rate limits for the custom code action. However, if the 3rd party will return 429 Rate Limited or 500 Server Error status codes when you make too many requests, we will automatically retry the actions, so you’ll still end up executing the code for every enrolled contact, it might just take a few tries for some of them"
