I'm trying to implement some dynamic content on a scroll to top button and I was wondering if there's a way to access HubSpot properties from the js file of the module, so I don't have to hardcode some of the text I'm injecting to the button. And also, to have translations easier to manage.\n\nIf you found something useful or anyone has done that before or found a simpler way without having to make an API call, let me know how you found the way. Thanks in advance!"
