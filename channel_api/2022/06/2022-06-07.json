Few noobish questions on a snippet created by Jack C - Creating a note and associating it to a contact record.\n\nIs this snippet drag and drop? As in, can I drop this into a custom code action and have it work? I don't see any definitions for object in workflow for example, guessing there is more to add here.\n\nAlso, I'd like to adept this for other object types, deal and tickets. Is it as simple as adjusting line 20 ~`Contact`~ -&gt; `Deal`\n\n`url: '<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/notes/>' + engagementID + '/associations/~contact~deal/' + event.object.objectId + '/NOTE_TO_~CONTACT~DEAL?hapikey=' + process.env.HAPIKEY,`\n\n<https://gist.github.com/jackcoldrick90/03366967f400f23eb27c4d49b53177a6>",

Anyone have any thoughts?",
