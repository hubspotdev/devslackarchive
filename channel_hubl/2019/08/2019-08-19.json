However, even though the account's language settings are set to Espa√±ol the month is outputting in English. Is there a setting somewhere I may be missing or something I need to add to this snippet {{ local_dt|datetimeformat('%d de %B de %Y') }} to output the month in Spanish or does it only output English?"
