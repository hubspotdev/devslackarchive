They have to pay for the time waiting for pages to update.\n\nEven tried to update templates and layouts to make it go faster.

Can HS CMS implementation have the ability to call out and fetch products from an external commerce solution?  For example ability to dynamically create a product detail page\n2. Can HS CMS be used by our customers to place items in a cart and place orders - all things transactional - with external commerce solution\nLooking at the ideal of moving towards a composable commerce architecture and want to see how HS CMS can play a role if any.\n\nThanks"
