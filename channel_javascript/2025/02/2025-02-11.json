Instead it still redirects to the URL setup in the form configuration within HubSpot itself.\n\nWhat am I missing or what do I need to do differently to override the redirect via the onFormSubmitted callback?\n```    onFormSubmit: function($form, data) {\n        let ppar = \"\";\n        ppar = $form[0].querySelector('input[name=\"practice_management_system___don_t_know\"]:checked');\n        ppar = ppar.search(\"Don't know, I'm a pet parent!\") &gt; -1 ? true : false;\n        if (ppar == true){\n            hubForms.ppar = true;\n        }\n    },\n    onFormSubmitted: function($form, data) {\n\t\t\t\t//console.log(data.submissionValues);\n                try{\n                    if (hubForms.ppar == true){\n                        window.location.href = \"<https://petdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360004308514-PetDesk-Mobile-App-Users>\";\n                    }\n                }catch(err){console.log(err);}\n    }```",
