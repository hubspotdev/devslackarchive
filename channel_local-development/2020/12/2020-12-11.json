It's uploading a bunch of files without any issues but I see 3 files failing for the same reason as below:\n\n```[ERROR] Uploading file \"[...]/templates/retail.html\" to \"my-website-theme/templates/retail.html\" failed\n[ERROR] Error validating template.\n[ERROR] line 0: Template does not include the tag {{ standard_footer_includes }}. Needed for HubSpot analytics```\nThese 3 templates do not have {{ standard_footer_includes }} but the base.html file that they extend does.\n\nAny ideas anyone?\nThanks!"

Even w/ the dev environment.\n\nIE if renaming module identifiers can lose info, etc (as far as I’m aware that seems to be the case). I think it’s recoverable if the name is reversed back but not sure.\n\nAlso have to kind of manually sync the dev/live site.\n\nUnless you want to forgo content creators editing the website and do all the overrides in the template but that seems nightmarish.\n\nThis is my understanding, someone correct me if any of that is incorrect."
