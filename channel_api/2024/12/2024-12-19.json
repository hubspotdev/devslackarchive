    "text": "Hello all!\nWe are updating the contacts in HubSpot that we have in our internal database with different metrics through the python API v3. We do that through matching of email, where we match the user in our database against the primary and associated email in HubSpot. If there is a match we pull the contact's object_id and then we update the users by the object_id. If a user is not found in HubSpot, we create a new user.\n\nRecently we have been having an issue with 3 different users which were originally created by this integration and have been updated for some time as well. Now, each pipeline call has a problem with one of these three users and it changes inbetween. Instead of updating the users, the code tries to create a new user which then triggers a conflict in HubSpot since the user already exists. I have looked at the email and names trying to find differences or whitespaces or any other thing that could interfere with the email-matching without finding anything. I have tried to do manual api calls for these users and manually updating the fields without issue. Has anyone else stumbled upon a similar issue with the API?\n\nThese are the methods we are using:\n• `BatchInputSimplePublicObjectBatchInput`\n• `PublicObjectSearchRequest`\n• `BatchInputSimplePublicObjectInputForCreate`",
