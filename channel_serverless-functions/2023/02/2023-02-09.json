    "text": "Have any of you solved handling data, without a key/value storage?\n\nI’m grabbing data from an external feed (press releases), and create/update/delete blog posts based on the content of the feed.\nInstead of having to look and compare data with HubSpot’s APIs, I’m storing the content of the feed in an object, and then perform the different checks, and forward payloads to either CRUD endpoint.\n“If `item2` already exists, don’t do anything”, “if `item5` is removed, send that payload to the `delete` endpoint”, etc.\nThis works wonderfully.\n\nHowever, every time I iterate on the function, thus reupload it, my “data store” object is emptied, meaning the operation starts over, all items in the feed are created in the blog again, and so on.\n\nAs far as I can see, there no way for me to persist this data object. So I need to store the data elsewhere.\nBut how - As a file? As HubDB rows? How would you do it?"
