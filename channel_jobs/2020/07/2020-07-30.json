    "text": "#HTMLslicing #HubSpotCMS\nSome time ago we hired two guys for *HTML Slicing* and *HubSpot CMS* implementation for our new webpage (<http://ideamotive.co|ideamotive.co>). We chose these two out of over 300 resumes we received and many interviews we had, to make sure we have the right people. The cooperation went perfectly, we figured a very efficient process to deliver quality, I couldn't find words to describe how happy we were with their work. As we specialize in building apps, very rarely we have projects that require such skills. It would be an absolute pity to give lose such diamonds just because we don't have projects for them currently.\nIf you currently seek such talent set I can imagine two cooperation models.\n\n1. Body-leasing and them working fully or partially on your projects on a very friendly hourly rate. \n2. We can take over some parts of your projects and keep the process and management that worked out before. \nPlease contact me at:\n<mailto:f.nasiadko@ideamotive.co|f.nasiadko@ideamotive.co>",
