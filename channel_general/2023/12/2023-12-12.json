We load members into lists either manually or automatically through form fill, we treat membership as a campaign response. I think HubSpot moving away from folders, so we looking for best practice aligned with HubSpot strategy. We also want to pull the lists, contacts, and date added to list via API, but it unclear if that COntact List v1 api something we should use or avoid. It also confusing now that you can just associate contacts to forms because it now creates multiple patterns and we looking for common pattern. HubSpot experts. Help!"
