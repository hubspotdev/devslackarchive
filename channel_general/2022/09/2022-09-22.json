They have an immediate requirement to integrate our two platforms :) I am running into a wall understanding what the Salesforce requirements are to allow for this. For e.g <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/salesforce/install-the-HubSpot-salesforce-integration> its says you need any Salesforce edition with an API enabled or Salesforce professional however Salesforce professional does not come with API access as standard. There is an ability to add on ‘web services API’ to professional but im not sure if this will allow the bi-drectional integration? Could someone help me out as I understand HubSpot manage the connector here. Thanks so much",

Then you can style it out in your stylesheet. you can do just abotu whatever you want with a cta.\n\nThat being said — I think the best way to use a cta is to use a button.  I say this because of how CTAs load in the page lifecycle.\nIf you are putting that button into a more designed out area — name it properly and only use it in that designed out area.\n\nWhile I have this soapbox, I think CTAs are over utilized by most — CTAs shouldn’t be in your header — they shouldn’t be on the home page. Those are not conversion path pages. The whole concept of ctas and how they report — I only use them in blogs and would recommend for you to do that as well.\n\nIf you have some two or three page conversion path, use ctas to track that. (and I’d advise conversion goals in GA as well) as long as you have a clear path to conversion and then can follow up from a CTA to a FORM, etc…"
