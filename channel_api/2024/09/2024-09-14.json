    "text": "Hi - I have Deals with related Consultants (custom objects). I need to create a Quote for each consultant. Looks like I cannot create any associations to a quote besides deal/contact but can probably access that data in the template from the deal object?  Problem is that this will send all the consultants data to all the quotes and I need to have one quote per consultant. If I had ability to pass a custom variable to the quote defining the ID of the consultant I could prob loop/filter but doesnâ€™t seem to be any free field. Suggestions? An idea is to pass the consultant ID as part of quote name and then parse/split that in template."
