    "text": "A few requests on the landing page you built:\n1) Can we adjust the name to not include the word “day”? I want to avoid any external or internal confusion around this being HubSpot official or not. With Agency Partner Day and Platform Partner Day, I think those that don’t read the fine print might assume it’s being hosted officially by us-- and I want to avoid that. Suggestions: HubSpot Developer Community Meetup, HubSpot Developers: Community Meetup, HubSpot Developer Meetup Group.\n2) Can we adjust the “hosted by HubSpot” language to read “sponsored by HubSpot”? Like #1, I feel like “hosted” has more of an “ownership” status.\n3) As cool as the little sprocket guy with eyeballs looks, it’s against our brand guidelines (and I think he’s HubSpot orange circa 2014 :stuck_out_tongue: ). You can reference this to see what we can do: <https://www.HubSpot.com/style-guide>. Bunch of helpful resources there.",

We’ll make sure to avoid using the word Day.\n#2 - understood, AJ I’d maybe just remove the parenthesis text from the header . We already have the location in there. I considered putting sponsored by HubSpot there, but then thought - we plan to have other sponsors on that page, so that could look odd.\n<@U2H3TT8F2>\n\nBTW AJ great photo of you giving a speech, no joke, it’s perfect."
