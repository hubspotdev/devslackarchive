    "text": ":bangbang: Help needed!\nLooks like HubSpot CMS is not serving the same page whether it’s been requested on desktop or on mobile. Has anyone ever experienced something silimar?\nI have an image, inside a repeater, inside a module.\nThe image is showing in the source when I load the page on desktop.\nBut when I open the page on mobile, or even using the dev tool emulating a mobile, the image is missing.\nHere’s what my hubl file looks like (simplified for the sake of readability):\n```{% if module.slides|length == 1 %}\n    {% if module.slides[0].video %}\n        {% if module.slides[0].video_thumbnail.src %}\n             IMAGE HERE\n        {% else %}\n             NO IMAGE\n        {% endif %}\n    {% endif %}\n{% endif %}```\nWhen I open the page on desktop, it shows “IMAGE HERE” ; but when I open it on mobile it shows “NO IMAGE”.\nCould it come from the image format? Although I tried a a few different images and the problem is the same.\nCould anyone provide some help it would be greatly appreciated :raised_hands:"
