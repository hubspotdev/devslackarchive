What I did:\n1) I viewed the source of the existing template\n2) I couldn't edit the template and was told I had to clone to edit -  so I did\n3) Then I updated the code to bootstrap 4.\n\nI can't work out why I can't do the following?\n1) Use my new .html file as a template\n2) Call the search module/function into the page (which was intended to reside in a sidebar\n3) Call the header (.html version) I have updated into my current blog template.html file\n\nI'd hoped that if I could convert the file back into a HS pretty UI version, I could just use the drag and drop functionality to add the search module and then the header / footer. Speaking with a support girl who pointed me back to Slack / the forums, they have informed me that I cannot convert it back to a HS UI version after it is set to HTML. So, I need to work out the best way to pull the header / search and footer into the template without having to hardcode it for our blog and page templates.\n\n The screenshot is of the preview page, which pulls all the necessary content in. Unfortunately, at the moment the search on the right is hardcoded. As is the main navigation (which is Bootstrap 4's boilerplate version). But I will ideally want to pull these in dynamically so that I don't duplicate my code",
