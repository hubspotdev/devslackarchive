    "text": "An idea of possibly opening up the reporting api's used for pulling stats in HS. This would allow us to create integrations into things like Google's Data Studio and more. I know there are ways to get data currently but they aren't exactly official api's. I know that Databox has an integration to HS so I am trying to see how they are able to get those stats when there is no public api for it"
