    "text": "Hey there :wave:\n\nIf anyone on HubSpot team reading this, appreciate any update.\nIt looks like currently there are some changes happening to the way how HubSpot is working.\nIt seems those changes are in real time. While doing my usual local dev routing I enchanted lots of issues. After the hours of notorious trouble shooting I realized that something with HS itself. For example, somehow the css of the theme is edited by HS on the server side. My css converted to some “combined.css”\nPage previews doesn’t work at all. Cashing is unbearable, the code can’t be overwritten.\nSome really weird stuff happening.\n<@U2H3TT8F2> <@U7SL518D6> do you know anything about this? Is this maintenance hours I’m encountering with?",
