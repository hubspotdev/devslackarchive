The inspect value is actually empty (even thought its displaying a random URL there when I click it, it disapears to just `url('')`"

When it fails, I have the hardest time combing through all the templates and modules to determine where an issue may be. I'm also unclear on what _is_ and what _isn't_ acceptable for successful combination. Is there a way to see where the CSS/JS combinator fails? To better define where an error might be?"

Should I modify the hero HubL to give me a drag and drop option to then place the code there, or straight into the HubL? SVG’s codes are pretty long and can be heavy. Thanks in advance!",
