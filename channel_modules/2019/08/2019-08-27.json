I've created a module for testing purpose with just a color field inside -&gt; I've inserted this module in a template -&gt; I've created a page from this template. When I visualize this page in editor, I cannot change the color. In the design manager, the option \"Prevent modifications in content editors\" is on. That's why I cannot change color in the page. But I cannot change this option: the switch/toogle element to change this option cannot be clicked. How can I make this element clickable?",

I’m trying to build a module, have linked my full stylesheet, and it seems to take until I add a field in. When I do that, the styles disappear entirely for that element. Any clues? I’m sure it’s something simple since I’ve never done this before, but I’m not coming up with much on Google. Thanks!",
