Unfortunately, this form exhibits a vertical overflow issue, causing an unpleasant user experience due to excessive scrolling vertical overflow . To address this problem, I am seeking advice on how to eliminate the vertical overflow and optimize the form's layout as I have tried to overwrite its styling but doesn,t take any styling in CSS .  Here is an  actual form <https://homedev.agileit.com/schedule-a-call>. It got some steps for confirmation and leads to the layout."
