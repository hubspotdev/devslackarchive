    "text": "Hello! I'm new here so I hope this is the right channel.\n\n*tl;dr*\nWhen making requests to `contacts/v1/lists/recently_updated/contacts/recent`, can I get the primary email of a contact by\n• taking the *first* element of the `identity-profiles` array\n• from this `identity-profiles` object, taking the unique element of the `identities` array with `\"is-primary\": true`\n*Full Context*\nI'm working on a HubSpot integration that makes requests to the `v1` legacy endpoint. In particular, I'm trying to access the primary email of the contacts in the response to `contacts/v1/lists/recently_updated/contacts/recent`.\n\nThe documentation for this endpoint is here:\n<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/get_recently_updated_contacts>\n\nIn the documentation, elements of an `identities` array (in `identity-profiles`) do not have `is-primary` or `is-secondary` properties. Based on our legacy code, I'm guessing that:\n• for each element of `identity-profiles`, only one element of the `identities` array has `type` `EMAIL`, \n• the first element of `identity-profiles` contains the primary email\n• the subsequent elements of `identity-profiles` are the record's merge history\nThis isn't explicitly spelled out anywhere I can see though, e.g.\n<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/contacts-overview>\n\nHowever, what I'm observing when I make these requests now matches what is described in\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/What-is-identity-profiles-in-contact/td-p/232911>\nin that\n• `EMAIL` type `identities` have either `\"is-primary\": true` or `\"is-secondary\": true`\n• only the first `identity-profile` contains `identities` with `type` `EMAIL`.\nWhen did this change? Are these observations correct?",
