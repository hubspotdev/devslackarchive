Something like this: ``` &lt;div class=\"{{ choice.value }}\"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ```"

    "text": "Thanks Robert! I'll try this out. What I'm trying to accomplish is to have a Customers table in HubDB where I have one customer per row. Then, the designer would manually create a page for a specific customer and select the customer from a drop-down so  that part of that page gets populated with content from the table. I understand there's also the possibility to create dynamic pages automatically from a table, but I fear that those pages are not customizable (the different customer pages would have varying content, different success stories to download and so forth)"
