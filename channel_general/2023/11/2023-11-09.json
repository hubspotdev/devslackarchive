    "text": "Hi! I'm not sure if this is the right channel, but I've got a question regarding the removal of properties in HubSpot projects:\n\nWe recently archived and then permanently removed a (contact) property in our project because it was missing a unique constraint (these can't be added retroactively). Now we would like to add these properties again, with the same property name, but a general error message is shown when doing do. This error dissapears once we add a suffix to the property name, indicating the error has to do with the property name.\n\nHow can we re-add properties with a name that has already been used in the past?"
