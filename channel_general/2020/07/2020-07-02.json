We have a client that was setup on HubSpot, all was well, then they signed up to use Imperva for added security on their domain and site. The site DOES still load as expected and seems fine. However, within HubSpot, it now says the domain is not connected and that the required DNS setup is not done. We’ve been back and forth with different people involved, but getting nowhere. Any suggestions on what we may need to do here to resolve this?",

Is it possible to have both of those sites, which shares the same root domain name, on different HS portals?
