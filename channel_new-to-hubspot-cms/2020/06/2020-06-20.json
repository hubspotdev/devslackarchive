    "text": "Hi! :wave: Looking for a wise advise. What we want to achieve is to have unique URL for each of the products in our HubSpot CRM Products so that each URL will look like this: <https://website.com/CATEGORY/NAME/ID?query> without using HubDb for that. Where /CATEGORY/NAME/ID is taken from HubSpot CRM Products.\n\nI came across that article on the web: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/building-dynamic-pages-with-hubdb>\nAnd this one: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tutorials/crm-data-for-cms-pages>\n\nBut still cannot make a final sentence on that issue. Any help is really appreciated!!!"
