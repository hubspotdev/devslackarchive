    "text": "Hey Y'all, I have been spinning on an issue for several days concerning  the theme settings tool. I have edited the fields.json and the theme-override.css files. I feel confident in my syntax in both but nothing seems to happen in the user view in terms of editing options. I feel like I'm missing something pretty stupid as I'm new to HubSpot but have been full stack developing for years. is there a trick I'm missing, I watched all the tutorials and ran through every quick start guide. The last thing I want is to have to edit the CSS file every time some marketer wants to change a font color. Thanks!",
