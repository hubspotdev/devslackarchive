(e.g. sql to mql, mql to subscriber)\"\n\nI have integrations that were supposed to update the lifecycle stages automatically, but every time they occur the contact with a 'higher' stage then they are meant to set - they just don't do it. So I assume it's a stage lock on the HubSpot side, tried googling and asking support, so that's how I've ended up here.\n\nWould highly appreciate any help with this issue.",
