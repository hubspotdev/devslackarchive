Is there anything I can do to help resolve this issue?\n\n*If you look at the attached picture, number 1 is the feature image specified in the blog post, number 2 is the visible image in the domain that was actually uploaded,\nNumber 3 is an image that comes out when you search on another company's site. *",

There seems to be a way to verify this. Also, I was able to confirm that about one out of 10 came out properly.",
