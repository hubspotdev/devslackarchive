The particularity is that we want to dynamically modify some information of the email (image, text, content...) with variables.\nHow to pass variables in an email template via the API to retrieve them in the template and interpret them? We can't find anything on the subject except Hubl variables which are data stored in HubSpot but nothing for external variables. Can you help me? Thanks in advance."
