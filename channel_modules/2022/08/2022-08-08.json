This if for an email template to toggle displaying a section if needed.\n I can get the UI to show a label for the setting, but when you click on it the checkbox has some text which just says \"value\". How can I change that?\n\n```  {% boolean \"enableSection1\" label=\"Enable Section 1\", no_wrapper=True, export_to_template_context=True %}\n\n&lt;div style=\"{% if widget_data.enableSection1.value == false %}display: none;{%endif%}\"&gt;\n  {% widget_block rich_text \"Section1\" overrideable=True, label='Section 1 Text Area', no_wrapper=True  %}\n    {% widget_attribute \"html\" %}\n    Content\n    {% end_widget_attribute %}\n  {% end_widget_block %}\n  &lt;/div&gt;```",
