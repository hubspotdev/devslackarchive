    "text": "looking for a better way to interact with other CMs info.\nWe are \"locked\" to use the \"name\" which is not the real module ID, but the module ID defined by the template. I am not really happy with that because if you remove/add the module that name will change so it's not really effective to work on that way. For now I am using `all_widgets|selectattr(\"label\", \"equalto\" \"name of the CM\")`\nbut if the name changes for any reason I have to update the code too...\nI realised then that the module_id looks like the internal module ID not the one we see in the URL. Any chance to get that module id (the one we see in the URL when editing the CM, I guess that is linked to the portal), or any way to access the internal module_id inside the CM environment?\n\nI know that CM should be independent, and that makes sense for marketplace but not for real custom projects that required advanced interactions."
