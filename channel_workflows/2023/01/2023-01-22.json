    "text": "Hi, I’m having issues with custom workflow actions, though it worked fine just yesterday (we might did some minor changes, but now there’s the same problem even with sample workflow action from HubSpot api docs. Custom workflow action when added to workflow gets an error “An unknown error occurred” with Server response “The response body for this request was empty”. Even though on our backend everything was executed correctly under 1 sec response was sent to HubSpot. I tried to switch workflow link to <http://webhook.site|webhook.site> and customized the response it is sending. So when Custom workflow action was executed I get an error in HubSpot workflow action logs. but when same webhook link is triggered by Webhook action, not my app action, it it green, and succesfully receives the response. Is it a problem on HubSpot side? Did anyone deal with some silimar issues? Thanks :pray:",
