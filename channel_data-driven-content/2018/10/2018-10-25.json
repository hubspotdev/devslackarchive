    "text": "Does anyone know if a HubDB table marked for \"use on dynamic pages\" automatically creates dynamic links even for rows where you leave the Page Path (hs_path) column blank? Is that a thing?\n\nThe info icon for that column says that the url \"must be unique in this table\" but it allows me to leave it blank for multiple rows. It appears google is creating dynamic links for all of the rows in my table (even the ones with no dynamic page path) and its using the page title (hs_name) as the dynamic link path instead. Has anyone else experienced this?\n\nThe rows with blank Page Paths are hard coded pages and I have a separate column that includes the hard coded page url instead.",
