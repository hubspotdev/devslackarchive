I am listing my questions below. If you have relevant input for me, you can comment on this thread, DM me, or<https://HubSpot.com/meetings/sparikh1/sparikh-HubSpot-15min| book a short meeting> with me. I'm eager to learn all things app settings! :thank-you:\n\n*Questions*\n1. What type of settings do you have today?\n    a. Are majority of settings specific to extension types (cards, workflows, timeline events)? What are those?\n    b. Do you have settings at App level in general too? What are those?\n2. Where do settings appear? Where would you actually want them to appear?\n3. Have you used existing App settings options with settings builder?\n    a. If yes, how do you find it?
