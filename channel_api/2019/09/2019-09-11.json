If you’re seeing an _Original Source_ of “Offline Sources” and an _Original source drill-down 1_ of “API,” that suggests the contacts are created via the Contacts API (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/create_contact>) instead of either the `identify` function (which would have the _Original Source_ set according to your `utm` parameters) or the Forms API.\n\nCan you direct message me a test contact record?"
