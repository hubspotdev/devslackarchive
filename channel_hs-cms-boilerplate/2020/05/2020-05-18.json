We just released a patch (v1.2.3) of boilerplate to add back in template and theme screenshots (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/releases/tag/v1.2.3>) that were missing. In addition to this, the boilerplate wiki is in progress and a first version of it should be wrapped up early on this week. Another announcement will be added here once it is completed."
