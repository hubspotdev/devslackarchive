    "text": "Hi Vasyl Matviishyn, HubSpot provides the ability to create custom code actions using JavaScript or any Node.js library. These custom actions can be used to make API calls, manipulate data, or perform any other custom business logic. To create a custom code action in HubSpot, you can navigate to Automation &gt; Workflows and click the + button to add a new action. Select the \"Custom code\" action type, enter a name for your custom code action, write your custom JavaScript code in the editor provided, and save your custom code action. Once you have created your custom code action, you can use it in your workflows just like any other action. When the workflow runs, your custom code will be executed as part of the workflow."
