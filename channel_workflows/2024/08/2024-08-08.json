We just ran another test, and it worked.\n\nI have a question: How does the custom code handle merging if both contact ID share the same phone number, but the other one has the email address? Does the contact with the email address automatically become the primary, or are we certain that the contact IDs without email addresses will be merged into the one with the email address? We want to ensure that no email addresses are lost in the process.\n\nThank you so much! :hugging_face:"
