    "text": "Hello everyone :hugging_face:\n\nFirst post for me ! I'm creating react cards and in one of them, I would like to include a mapview component from the react-native-maps package.\nI wrote my imports like that :\n\n```import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { HubSpot } from '@HubSpot/ui-extensions';\nimport MapView from 'react-native-maps';```\nAnd got an error during the upload of my app :\n\n`\"There was an unexpected error building the extension files. Please try again. Contact HubSpot support if the error keeps happening:  Error: [vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import \"react-native-maps\" from \"/tmp/extensions/CardCompanyLocation.jsx\".`\n`This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.`\n`If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to`\n``build.rollupOptions.external`\"`\n\nSo I would have two questions for you :\n• Is it possible to use an external package ?\n• In which file should I add my module in order to externalize it ? \nThanks a lot :blush:",
