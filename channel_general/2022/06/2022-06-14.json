    "text": "Hello everyone,\nThis is a questions about _*Offline Events and Facebook Lead Generation Campaigns:*_\n• I have connected my client HS and FB accounts\n• now I also created events in HS and I want to push them to FB - I though that would be easy\n• but it seems like it is not possible to launch campaigns that optimize by events unless I also use a developer t connect HS CRM to FB.\n• the above is what I understand after spending 4 hours yesterday trying to figure out why I do not see the offline events in FB. and after chatting with Facebook support and got from them this answer:\n• Do I need a developer to do the integration? The answer to this question is yes, you may check this link to learn more about \"CRM Integration\".\n<https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/guides/crm-integration>\nSet Up Your CRM for Conversion Leads\n<https://www.facebook.com/business/help/279369167153556>\n\n• I just chated with HS Support and the answer was - it seems like offline conversion events are indeed not the easiest for Facebook to ingest and they do require some form of custom integration\nDoes anyone have experiance with such integration and can help me get things working?",
