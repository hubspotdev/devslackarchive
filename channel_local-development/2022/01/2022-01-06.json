I was able to configure my local dev environment but when i run the command to upload (\"npx hs upload demo-theme demo-theme\") it returns an error saying \"The path \"demo-theme\" is not a path to a file or folder\". when I run the command I am in the demo-theme directory. Any ideas?",

Is shorthand for upload everything in this directory. \n\nWhat you had initially run was looking for a directory called “demo-theme” but you were already in that folder so it couldn't find it. \n\nAnother solution would have been to cd ../ and then run your original command from the demo-theme parent folder. \n\nDoes that make sense?"
