So, it could be something to do with that.\n\nHowever, I do have *one* odd hunch that might be worth looking into: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/tags#menu|the documentation for the HubL Menu Tag> passes the value for the `flyouts` property as a string, rather than a boolean.\n\nIt’s likely nonsense, but it might be worth trying if nothing else seems to cut it."
