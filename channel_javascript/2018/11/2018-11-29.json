I’m working on making my own mobile menu from scratch and can’t seem to get the right thing to happen when I tap the menu items that have children on mobile. In Dev Tools - it straight up just closes the instant it opens. On the phone it works - most of the time but sometimes takes a few taps to close a menu you’ve opened. I’m bad at javascript so any feedback at all is welcome."
