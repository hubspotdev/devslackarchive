    "text": "Hey gang, I am an infrastructure engineer for a company that uses HubSpot. I don't think this is really the right place, as it is obviously focused on developing on top of the HubSpot platform. But I have been trying to find a way to communicate with HubSpot about some backend feature deficiencies that support wasn't able to give me any good answers about. Someone responded to one of my posts and told me that HubSpot engineers hang out here and might be able to shed some light on my questions.\n\nThe ideas forum is a bust because it is incredibly bias in favor of platform enhancements over infrastructure enhancements. I'm looking for a suggestion about how to approach HubSpot about 1&gt; why their SAML implementation is not complete (i.e. it doesn't have a way to grab the username when a connection comes in from an identity providers portal) so users have to take the extra step of providing their email address to log in reducing the purpose of SSO. And 2&gt; Now that DNS providers have created solutions for CNAME like records for apex/root dns records (ALIAS or ANAME records) allowing us to use dns to alias domain.tld to <http://www.domain.tld|www.domain.tld> destination; why can't we add root hosts to our site configurations.",
