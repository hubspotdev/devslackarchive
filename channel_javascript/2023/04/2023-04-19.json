To prevent collecting data from non-HubSpot forms that do not have a class or ID, you can include a hidden label and input field, change the CSS ID or class attribute in your external form provider, toggle the \"Collect data from website forms\" switch on/off, or use the \"Collect data from website forms\" option in the Non-HubSpot Forms menu."

    "text": "<@U051U6YAMAL> sorry, just now seeing this. Erin is correct, you need an event listener to make sure the script loads after the form. We implemented this in a custom form module's javascript section like this:",
