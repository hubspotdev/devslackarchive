Even installed a boilerplate cms theme and it’s throwing errors on JSON files only for updating them either through local watch or directly in Design Tools. Does anyone know if this is an issue with the hubSpot CMS CLI update? I was prompted on Terminal to update it and I did, then I had all these JSON issues.",
