    "text": "Assuming these are pages that should be prioritized from an SEO perspective?\n\nIf so, I would start by looking at the crawl path to those URLs. \n\nCheck for unnecessary redirects that are adding additional hops along the crawl path.\n\nIf a crawler isn't following the route you'd expect (ie, why isn't it crawling a link on the homepage?) check to see when that link is getting rendered. Check for any obstacles and remove them.\n\nDeprioritize crawling of URLs that don't matter… noindexed content, pages that aren't intended to be a landing page/entrance, etc.\n\nRemember that tools spit this out as a warning because a homepage tends to have the most incoming links and authority, but that's not always true and sometimes you might have many  other good candidates as a primary source or internal links. It's often just as good to have an authoritative blog post on your site be the primary crawl path.  "
