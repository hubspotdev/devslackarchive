GTW Test) , for that I am using this endpoint: ( <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/update_contact-by-email> ). It gives me 204. But the property is not getting updated. Is there any specific way to update or checked this property value for this particular email id? , So that I don't need to select the options manually.",

    "text": "We are a Shopify store. We're currently launching a non-Shopify checkout that will handle a portion of our checkouts. This checkout takes place on a different domain from our store.\n\nThe HubSpot&lt;&gt;Shopify integration takes care of customer identification when they make a purchase. Shopify identifies the new customer, and all pre-purchase site behavior is tied to the new contact.\n\nIs it ok to identify a new contact on a different domain from the one where the site activity took place? For example, a customer comes to <http://xyz.com|xyz.com> and views several pages. They then checkout through <http://xyzshop.com|xyzshop.com>. If I identify the customer on <http://xyzshop.com|xyzshop.com>, will it still successfully tie the <http://xyz.com|xyz.com> shop behavior to that contact in HubSpot?",
