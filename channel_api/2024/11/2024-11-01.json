    "text": "Hi all! I've searched the <#C2YHAHB6K|api> thread for direction, but I haven't found what I need yet. i created a custom Account object. i also created an association between Account and Deal. how can i delete the association between Account and Deal? i'm not looking to delete an association label or the an association between Deal and Account records. I want to delete the association altogether as Account should not be related to Deal. i believe i could do this by dropping/recreating my custom Account object, but this would require a great deal of work. also, i've been pointed to the developer api documentation as well but it is not sufficiently intelligible for me to know what to do. an example call that does what i'm looking for would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance!",
