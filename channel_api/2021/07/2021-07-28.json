    "text": "Hi,\nWe'd like to capture actions taken by a user inside our SaaS application against the respective HubSpot contact in an activity timeline fashion.\nBut from what I could gather from <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/timeline|this> article, it says we need to create and \"_Publish_\" an app on the HubSpot app market place in order to do that (???)\n\nWouldn't publishing this app make it available for general audience in the HubSpot app marketplace? What am I getting wrong? Can someone please help out with this.\nThanks in advance :raised_hands:"
