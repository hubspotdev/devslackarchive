    "text": "Hello :wave::skin-tone-4: Wondering if anyone has a solution...\n\nLots of companies would love to use HubSpot quoting with all the amazing features it has... however:\n\nHubSpot quoting only works if your products are single-component rather than products with permutations - Bills of Materials (BOMs).\n\nFor example, you could have a car with 10 paint colours, 2 engine choices, and 4 alloy choices.  It wouldn't be feasible to have SKUs for every permutation in HubSpot. Ideally HubSpot would allow configurable products but failing that is there a workaround?\n\nMany thanks in advance!"

However, when I examine the backend, I noticed that some treatment names in the properties field are coming with a '/t' in a way that is not present in others. I haven't encountered such an issue with the rest, but I'm experiencing a problem with six of them as shown in the image below. Has anyone encountered a similar issue before? Thanks in advance.",
