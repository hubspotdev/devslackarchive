Using membership on a new site, but wondering if there is a way to authenticate a user’s login status that could be implemented so assets on private member-only pages couldn’t be accessed by public users that happen to learn the direct URL of the asset (like a download link). I need to be able to restrict those assets to attempted access to them would check the same auth that the private pages do. Any pointers in the right direction would be awesome. Thanks!"
