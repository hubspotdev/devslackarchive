    "text": "Hi <@U7SL518D6> and <@U01KL53R4LD>. Thank you for your help.  I was able to create the theme.\n\nI think it would be very helpful if HubSpot could put together a quick document with the steps that are needed to properly create the boilerplate.  I was working through the Section to build CMS templates and all of a sudden the instructor has a pre-compiled project with the template inside of scr/templates and some template css file that we, the learners, dont have access to.  It just jumps around a lot.  I was not able to properly create the template and could not access it in the HS CMS.\n\n<@U01KL53R4LD> - I'm a full stack developer and see similarities to React/Vue and like the IDE but feel that the certification courses tend to force you to figure out how to get the important boilerplate info on your own and am not surprised you needed the assistance of a SW Engineer to help solve your issue.  I spent an extra 3 hours trying to figure out how to fix these issues versus learning about the CMS in the course."
