In certain articles, I would like to restrict sections of content so that only members that log in will be able to view this.\nYet so far from what I understood of the HubSpot Documentation (<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/website-pages/require-member-registration-to-access-private-content>) I can only restrict an entire blog and not just a specific article, much less a section of said article.\n\nIs there a way to set this up in HubSpot or would I be best served trying to make my own mechanic?",

The blog itself may not be the best place for that content if that’s the aim unless the structure of the content is consistent across all of the documentation pages (you would use a module for this).\n\nThe jist though is you’d use smart content to display certain content based on list membership\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/website-pages/create-and-manage-smart-content-rules>"
