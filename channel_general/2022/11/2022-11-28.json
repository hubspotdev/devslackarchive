    "text": "Hello, I was wondering if any one had some experience with migrating blogs out of HubSpot to WordPress? I'm in a project now where we got the plugins for the csv upload into WordPress, and we used the <https://bootstrapcreative.com/how-to-migrate-a-HubSpot-blog-to-wordpress> process here to get the text. What im getting stuck on is this portion;  `{% set export = blog_recent_posts('BLOG ID', 200) %}\"post_title\",\"post_slug\",\"post_date\",\"post_content\",\"post_thumbnail\",\"post_author\",\"post_category\",&lt;br&gt; {% for content in export %} \"{{ content.name|forceescape }}\",\"{{ content.slug|forceescape|replace('blog/', '') }}\",\"{{ content.publish_date_localized|forceescape }}\",\"{{ content.post_body|replace('\"','\"\"')|forceescape|escape_jinjava }}\",\"{{ content.featured_image }}\",\"{{ content.blog_post_author }}\",\"{{ content.topic_list|forceescape|replace('[', '')|replace(']', '') }}\"&lt;br&gt;{% endfor %}`  Running it with the `('BLOG ID', 200)`  gets the data i need for the 200 posts, but i have 400 posts to get, i thought i could change the 200 to 400 and be done but it only pulls the 200. Any guidance will be appreciated."

How are we supposed to support multiple brands using this newer API? With the looming November 30th request to update our keys, I am seeing many of the older legacy API calls (in production systems) simply are not supported with the private app keys.",
