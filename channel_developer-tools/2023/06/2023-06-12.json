In the website, it also shows an icon. But, there’s no image link to an icon anywhere and only has an Id attribute which I’m assuming has the properties of a background image applied to it. I have no clue what’s the best way to navigate all the CSS files quickly and efficiently in order to find this Id. Any help would be great. I also do not have any global CSS stylesheets included.",
