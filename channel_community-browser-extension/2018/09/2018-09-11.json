To install the extension there’s a link to the stable version and the beta version on the github aka Will’s hair modeling site.\n\nIf you like the extension we can always use another hand to add more features and fix bugs. We have lots of items tagged Good First Issue. If you’re interested.\n\nSomeday we might add a feature to buy the individual devs who work on it a beer/coffee/mountain dew/(dev preference). We haven’t done it yet though.\n\n<https://github.com/williamspiro/HubSpot-Developer-Extension>"
