Give control to content editors if they want to change the default spacing while the CSS allows for \"automation\".\n\nI was not aware of the full-width embed option. Was this recently implemented? However, we have removed all !important now and it works for us. It is a minor thing that articles before 2019-09 will not have the same width as newer articles, which was the reason why we added !important. Because we wanted the layout to be consistent regardless. Also, we were afraid you would change things again :slightly_smiling_face:"

We are in the midst of releasing a prod notify for the new embed features/structure. You happened to find this out before we released the notification (we should have released this prior to you stumbling over it, however).\n\nThe plan is for this new embed structure &amp; classnames to not change! The embeds are in a better state with the new updates, and if we can give control to the content editors to specify inline styles for margins as mentioned then things will be looking pretty solid.\n\n&gt; we have removed all !important now and it works for us\n\nReally glad to hear this! I will reach out to you once we’ve figured out a solution to the above^ when you can remove the `!important` from your class margin styles, but in the meantime it looks like you are in good shape :smile:"
