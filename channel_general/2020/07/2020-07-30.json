When we went to renew it the status changed from expired to active like expected, however our account never actually updated and seem to be locked out of syncing locally or even viewing the files we had in the design manager.\n\nHubSpot seems to not really offer any support to devs. Anyone have any solutions or experience this before? We can easily create a new test account and that works fine, but it of course doesn’t have any of projects."
