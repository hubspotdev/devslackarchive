For example, are they subdomains or different brand domains?\n\nZooming out, we are thinking a lot about the relationship between your theme (or child theme), your domain, and your brand (color, fonts, logo, etc.)."

Meaning they have an account and a website built already, along with many different templates, landing pages etc. I am trying to shorten dev time and am wondering if I can use a theme for a new page design that has been requested?  Does it impact other pages? Thanks in advance and happy to be part of the community!\n",
