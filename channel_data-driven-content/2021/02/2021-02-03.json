    "text": "Hey all. We have a listing environment managed by HubDB. Each of the 300+ dynamically generated pages have a few forms embedded on them. When looking at page analytics for the individual pages, even though there have been form submissions, they are all reporting 0 form submissions. All form submissions are being counted on the parent template. Is there a better way we can be capturing conversions on individual pages?"
