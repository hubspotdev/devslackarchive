Our workforce development NPO connects students to the services and training they need to find paying careers.\n\nI could really use some help in the e-mail newsletters. For some reason there is a pretty good gap between our first coded module on the right side, before it had leveled with the left side, HubSpot support can't figure it out either. =( Any help is deeply appreciated!",
