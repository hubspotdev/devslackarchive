(in my list sync, I create any contacts that are not in HubSpot before adding the contacts by VID to a list using `/crm/v3/lists/xxx/memberships/add`)\n\nI'll work on adding retries to my code. I'm still convinced that it's something to do with the fact that i'm sending lots of emails to HubSpot at once since i'm sending a payload like `{\"properties\": {\"email\": \"<mailto:brian@HubSpot.com|brian@HubSpot.com>\"}}, ...` to the contacts batch create endpoint"
