    "text": "I have a question: I have a webpage that is hosting a HubSpot form that is collecting some custom properties that are being stored into the active contact's record. The goal is to have the page submit the form to the same page and have the page, upon submission be customized based on the submitted information. Specifically:\n\nThe page has a list of scholarships drawn from a HubDB table. The user enters their demographic information and the page updates to show them which scholarships they may be eligible for.\n\nEverything is working EXCEPT when the form is submitted the information displayed when the page is reloaded is the old information (it does not updated the form content). If you simply hit refresh on the page it updates but evidently, HubSpot is not processessing the data from the form until after it is rendering the page - HOW DO I FIX THIS? It seems crazy that you can't rely on HubSpot to do things in a logical order!",
