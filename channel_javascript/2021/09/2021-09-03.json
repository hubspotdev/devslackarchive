    "text": "I’m trying to update a date field in a form with JS, and I think I’ve hit some bugs with HubSpot date time formats (i’m in the UK)\n\nSo when I add this date US formatted, (Jan 10th 2022)\n```$('.date input[readonly]').val('01/10/2022').change();```\nIt updates the field and returns the UK format 09/01/2022 as I desire (the change in date is something to do with timezones but I wrote some code to solve that)\n\nMy issue is when the day gets above 12 e.g.\nJan 15th 2022\n```$('.date input[readonly]').val('01/15/2022').change();```\nThe value in the field says 01/15/2022 and when I click on it reverts to the previous date as it’s not recognised it as a date.\n\nI’ve tried adding setting the value as a date object, I’ve tried several different formats, using dashes and slashes etc, the only one that seems to actually update the field is using slashes,\n\nHas anyone had to solve this before? got any tips?",
