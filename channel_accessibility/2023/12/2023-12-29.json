With Custom Objects, you have the flexibility to define and add custom fields tailored to your unique business needs.\n2. Custom Objects support more complex data structures, enabling the representation of intricate line item relationships or additional information associated with each line item.\nMulti-Relation Mapping:\n3. Custom Objects allow for multiple relationships with other objects. This is beneficial if line items need to be associated with various entities beyond deals, providing a broader and more versatile data model.\nEnhanced Reporting:\n4. Custom Objects facilitate the creation of custom reports and dashboards, enabling you to extract and analyze data in a way that aligns with your specific reporting requirements. This can be particularly useful for in-depth analysis of line item data.\n5. You can create custom automation rules specific to your line item processes, enhancing workflow automation and ensuring that your unique business logic is accommodated."
