I have a client who wants each subscription to have sub subscriptions and when they unsubscribe from an email, to only show a limited number of items (subscription and sub-subscription) on the unsubscribe page (including the unsubscribe all) and specific branding dealing with the main subscription.  I thought using a query would be a way to do it, but I had the same issue as you where it wasn't reading the query.  Would love to see how yours worked out"
