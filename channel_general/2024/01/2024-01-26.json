    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nQuick heads up – stumbled upon something kinda annoying about date properties stamped via workflow vs API. If you're using a workflow to stamp a date, it won't capture the time, just rounds it to a neat 12:00 AM. Thought it'd work like the create date property, but nope. Not sure if this is common knowledge, so just tossing it out there. Check out the attached pic to see what I mean when you pull the date from HubSpot.\n\nCheers!",
