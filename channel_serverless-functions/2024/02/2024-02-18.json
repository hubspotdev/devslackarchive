Maybe I missed something, what hubl functions could we use to filter based on data living in 'widgets' part of the blog? \n    c. If we use js_partial, we need to set up a project for the React part. We don't use them yet. \n2. Generating tailwind classes? \n    a. The serverless files lives inside the theme. "
