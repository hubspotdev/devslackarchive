The channel account is created successfully into the Inbox and can be found in the Inbox Settings; it is always deactivated and has to be manually activated from the Inbox Settings (update/patch API doesn't work in updating the `active: true` ) - this wasn't the case a few weeks ago. Can you please advise why is this the case? And is there a way to install an active channel account from the get-go? Thank you.",
