    "text": "Hello all! Any guidance would be incredibly appreciated here: we are creating an asset (website theme) to submit to the HubSpot marketplace. And in the demo, we would like to use images that we have a license to use from our getty account. The issue is that if the user downloads the theme from the Marketplace, they will not have permission to use those images on their live site that they create from our theme. Not sure if we can still use that imagery, and if we can just add terms somewhere noting that images need to be replaced upon purchase? What is best practice here?",
