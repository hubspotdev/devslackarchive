    "text": "Hi everyone, I wasn't sure which channel to post in but I need help with deleting activities (Such as email threads and attachments) that accidentally get associated with the wrong deal or ticket. For example, my client's team is forwarding emails from referrals to a specific inbox in HubSpot. But because these emails are coming from referrers (i.e. hospitals, GPs, retirement centres), they sometimes forward an old email that mentions other deals or tickets. So now, the old thread is causing associations for the new conversation. I may have found a solution through an app but I was wondering if anyone knows of a solution that doesn't require a third party app."
