Since there was no instruction on merging the `working-branch` to `main` , I didn't do so. I thought the examiner would check the branch.\n\nI just learned that I failed the practicum because the `main` branch if the exact copy of the fork but my work is all in the `working-branch`.\n\nMaybe I'm being silly, but might be a good idea to add this to the requirements :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nAnyway, I've merged it to main and resubmit again.\n:crossed_fingers:"
