We are using the _unofficial_ custom modules API to create modules, which works fine for old modules but we’re trying to make it work with the new IDE. \n\nAfter updating the fields / structure based on the new modules, creating a new module works but the module still triggers the “Upgrade module” popup and it doesn’t show up under `/modules` (FTP). Is there an API endpoint we need to call to register the module as a new module and to create the module folder?",
