    "text": "yeah! it sounds like you need to optimize the calls using hubl better or by using graphql. \n\nyou can also use ajax calls on the page serverless functions to pull in some of the content on page scroll or on demand. \n\ni’d suggest redesigning what you are doing so you aren’t bringing this much information into a page.  create sub pages etc that manage certain things. again, this might be invalid because if needs. \n\nbasically lazy loading your calls is going to help out. \n\nif you still need some help with this we could help you at deckerdevs\n\napologies for being so late i was away from slack for a while "
