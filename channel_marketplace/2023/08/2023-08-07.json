    "text": "Hey, of course you can't include any reliance on HubDB, serverless functions, membership app, custom objects, etc for Marketplace to begin with. To be clear for starter, do not use any CTA or video fields. While the theme would still be listed, a warning would show on the listing for Starter or Free CMS users. Also, do not use a HubSpot Payments module or any connection to the meetings scheduler. Essentially, just make sure the theme is pretty \"bare bones\", using core elements only."
