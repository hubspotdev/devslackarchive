That mostly is better correlated with performance because the parsing and execution time it takes to run JavaScript is much more related to uncompressed size. Even though the compressed size does correlate well with the time to download, many people tend to overlook the parsing and execution cost of JS, which will even happen when JavaScript is cashed (and the recommendation to pay more attention to uncompressed)"

And (new to me) it seems like if your module _could_ be used in an email the logic for `load_external_fonts` won’t work. So we think you might be able to fix things by having `host_template_types: [\"PAGE\"]` inside your JS module `meta` config."
