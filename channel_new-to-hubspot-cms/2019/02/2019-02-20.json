Recently I also started to develop templates in the HubSpot CMS and I am looking for some best practices for template development. I have used code editor and added some Hubl so content specialist can change the contents. Now I also would like to try to build templates using the drag and drop editor with custom modules, but I can't really find some best practices on what steps t take (apart from the academy course).",
