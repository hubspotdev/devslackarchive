    "text": "Public Beta: Custom Channels API We're excited to introduce the Custom Channels API (BETA), a powerful new API available for Sales and Service Enterprise accounts, on September 10th, 2024. This API allows developers and partners to integrate any text-based, two-way messaging channel into HubSpot's Help Desk and Inbox workspaces. With this API, developers can connect popular channels like LINE, Telegram, WeChat, Viber, Apple Business Chat, or even niche and proprietary channels tailored to specific industries. This allows companies to offer truly omnichannel customer service, empowering them to connect with customers on their preferred communication platforms. For more details, please refer to the Developer Changelog and new landing page. Thank you! :rolled_up_newspaper: View on Changelog button :mega: View on Landing Page button",
