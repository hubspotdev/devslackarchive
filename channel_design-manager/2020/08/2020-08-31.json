    "text": "Hello guys! We want to switch the templates of all our landing pages. According to this <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/cos-general/how-do-i-edit-my-blog-email-page-template|HubSpot blog post>, it looks like we can simply change the template and the content will carry over, save for a few drag-n-drops. The screenshot below also supports this.\n\nHowever, when actually switching templates, all the content from the page disappears and we have to reenter. This will result in us having to essentially recreate all our landing pages. Is there some kind of requirement for templates to be compatible and have the content carry over? Or is there no other way?\n\nThank you all!",
