    "text": "I am looking for someone to help me with some code I need for a HubSpot Programmable Automation recipe with the goal of feeding some client’s HubSpot data via a workflow into their Netsuite Leads object which wasn’t possible using the native integrations prior to us having upgrade to Ops Hub Pro. HubSpot have suggest it should be no more than a couple of hours to configure, “easily no more than half a day of developer time” and I am sure they referred to somewhere online that had a number of recipes available publicly to achieve this, but I don’t really know where to look and as I’m not a developer myself I’m struggling to find the best way to achieve what the client needs! Does anyone have any experience of this please and availability to help get this code configured? Thanks in advance.",
