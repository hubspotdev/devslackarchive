    "text": "Hello everyone, I have a quick question. I made a module for job listings with a field structure like this --&gt;\n -department (Field group &amp; repeating)\n• department name (text)\n• job module (Field group and repeating)\n      + job title (text)\n      +  job location (text)\n      + job Link (link)\n\nI was planning on repeating the department module  with relevant jobs in each department.\nNow here is the actual question: Can I use Hubl to count the amount of jobs in each department and have it show next to the department name?\n\nI thought I could use the length or count macro of Hubl but it keeps throwing an error\nif it cant be done, I'll just do it in JS but I figured I could save a bit of coding with only hubl",
