    "text": "Hi <@U07VAD9SL1G> - the original intent for Android at the outset of the SDK in 2023 was to only support the current version plus 5 versions back to reduce scope of development and testing. Even though the minimum SDK platform ended up being more generous than that, unfortunately there are no plans to support anything earlier than level 26 at this time."
