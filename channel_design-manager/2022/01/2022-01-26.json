It broke my page pretty bad :angry: It wasn’t doing it before… not sure when it started doing it. I’ve tried deleting and retyping the character as well as copy/pasting from another working DIV. The comment serves to end the DIV at the moment, and won’t break anything if it starts working correctly again, but it’s not ideal and I worry that this could/is happening elsewhere",
