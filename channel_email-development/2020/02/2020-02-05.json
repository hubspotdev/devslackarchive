    "text": "I'm trying to set up a Net Promoter Score email and I'd like respondents to end up in one of 3 buckets. I want to do this with a custom contact property called \"NPS bucket\". I'd like that property to be set by the email template based on what button the respondent clicks. I'm trying to do this because none of the workflows I've looked at seem to work for me. Does anyone know if there is a way to set a property from within an email template? (e.g. with an a href tag or some other way). I'm pretty new to HubSpot templates (and workflows for that matter) so don't hesitate to tell me I'm running the wrong way. Thanks!",
