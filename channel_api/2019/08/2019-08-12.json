    "text": "hey folks -- I'm relatively new to working with APIS and while I understand the gist of things, one thing I can't really wrap my brain around is how to make a portal's API key private. I've seen it done in Angular apps where you can set it up serverside, but I'm not sure how to apply that theory to the HS file management system. Would any of you happen to have any pointers for me?",

Is that accurate?\n\nIf so, most of HubSpot’s APIs (including the CMS Files API) do not support client-side requests as they expose your API key: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/faq/do-HubSpot-apis-support-ajax-request>. As you mentioned, most set up server-side processes for uploading and managing files.\n\nPlease let me know if I’ve misunderstood your question!"
