I checked <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/conversations_api/|Conversations Live Chat Widget API> and didn't find an answer for this question. Does anybody know if it is possible? My application does not change url to something related with `/en` or `/de` , thats why I need to do it with javascript.",
