    "text": "Hi team,\nI have created custom Quotes templates and added the payment gateway API for payment using JS and it's working fine once the payment is done I added the payment Status using JS DOM. but when I download the quotes templates it returns the initial quotes and does not take the updated one which is updated by JS code. Can you provide solutions for that if there is any turnaround or we can update the download quotes templates?"
