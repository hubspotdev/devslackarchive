I am thinking about using hubdb table and then cross-checking user credential against it. But Please suggest am I thinking in the correct direction? Please respond if possible with example.",

It is NOT available for CMS is they do not also have an Enterprise product also.\n\nThe Knowledge-base link you posted above is the best resource to get started.\nWe also have a slack channel dedicated to this feature -  check out  <#CD5RBLPBL|cms-membership> and post questions there.\nIf you  would like to test the functionality, you can always start an Enterprise product 14-day trial to test it out.\n\nIf you determine the built in HubSpot Membership functionality will not work for your project, you can look at 3rd party options. The link AJ posted above is the one I typically send to people to review."
