    "text": "Hi Andreas, files are all stored in the same location. If you’re referring to the drop down in the file details section on the file manager dashboard, that just lets you select a domain for the “copy url” button. Files can be served out of either HubSpot’s provided domains (<http://cdn2.HubSpot.net|cdn2.HubSpot.net> which is old, or <http://f.HubSpotusercontent.net|f.HubSpotusercontent.net> which are our new domains) or any domains you may have connected to HubSpot.\n\nIdeally when creating your pages and content, you want to use your domains to serve your files. This should already happen automatically if you build content using the provided editors, but if you’re copying urls directly into code you would want to make sure you’re using the domain that matches the page you’re making."
