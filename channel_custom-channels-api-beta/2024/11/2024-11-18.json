I am stumbling across another issue: when trying to <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/api/conversations/create-custom-channels#file-attachments|publish a received message to HubSpot with an attachment>, no provided attachment type works except STICKER &amp; VOICE_RECORDING. Regardless of the actual type of the attachment, any type except those results into `Unsupported file usage type OTHER, allowed types are: STICKER,VOICE_RECORDING` - any idea what I am missing here? Thank you :sunflower:",
