    "text": "Hey <@U02EHGZTNHG>! It seems like that error message is recommending you use a relative path to the file, instead of an absolute. I’m not sure what your file structure looks like, but it’d be something more like `&lt;script src=\"{{ get_asset_url('../js/filename.min-4.0.0.js') }}\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`. You could also try adding a slash before the theme folder name.
