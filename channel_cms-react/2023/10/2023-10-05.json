I tried adding a iframe\n```&lt;iframe width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-src={`<https://www.youtube.com/embed/${youtubeId}>`} allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;```\nBut the HTML inside the iframe is empty. Am I missing something?",

    "text": "Mmm I’m still stuck with this one, the fact that part of the team cannot work with the react feature with storybook having already implemented the library is a small problem. Has anyone here had the opportunity to run a project, for example this one: <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-js-building-block-examples/tree/main/graphql-storybook> on a Windows computer without problems? If so, it would be great to know what he did differently so we could compare.\n\nJust a small note, the project in react runs correctly, it only breaks when run with `--storybook` which makes me think it could be something related only to the dependency, but the strange thing is that it only happens in Window."
