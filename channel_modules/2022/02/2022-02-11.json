It turns out to have the external URL option but after inserting the anchor link '#assettracer' and save then refresh the page. It doesn't work as expected, it does reload the page and works as refreshing the current page.\n\nThis is the page I am talking about <http://www.realtimenetworks.com|www.realtimenetworks.com>",
