    "text": "Hi HubSpot Team,\nI’m currently working on an AngularJS project where I’m embedding a HubSpot form on our /contacts page using the following code snippet:\n\nIn this implementation:\nI'm using AngularJS to load the HubSpot form dynamically based on the language stored in a cookie.\nI've hidden the default submit button from the HubSpot form and replaced it with a custom button that triggers the form submission.\nI'm applying a custom stylesheet to the form by injecting it into the iframe.\nI've tried to force a form view event using _hsq.push() within the onFormReady callback.\nWhile the form is loading and submitting correctly, the view event is not being tracked in HubSpot. I’ve verified that the tracking code is in place and that the form view event is triggered, but it still doesn’t reflect in HubSpot analytics.\nCould you please advise if there's anything wrong with this approach or if there are additional steps I should take to ensure form views are tracked properly?",
