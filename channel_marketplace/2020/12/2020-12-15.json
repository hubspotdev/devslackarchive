    "text": "All themes have been reviewed by today. Judges have been reviewing themes since the submission deadline. So they were reviewed in the state they were in when the individual judges got to each theme.  Of course since the theme is in the marketplace you should still continue making updates if it will make the quality you deliver to customers better. Better themes mean more installs and more sales"
