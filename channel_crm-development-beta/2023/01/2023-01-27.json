    "text": "Perfect, so Dependabot is just saying this library has a security vulnerability in it and that is's recommended to update it. You may or may not be using a part that is vulnerable. It basically says that any version that is below 4.6.2 has the vulnerability. If `npm update` doesn't work, you could always manually bump up to a newer version such as `4.6.2` in your `package.json`.\n\nIm not totally familar with how dependabot, but if its not updating this message, and you still have the try again button showing (as seen in the image you attached), you could try clicking that, because it may be failing to rerun."
