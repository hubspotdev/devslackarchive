It is occurring at the HubSpot Offices in Cambridge <https://goo.gl/maps/jprJ75r3USdyaNkb8>\n\nThe hotel shuttles will not take you there.\nTaking a ride share, taxi or public transit is probably easiest, I would not advise using a rental car, streets and parking in Boston and Cambridge is a little crazy.\n\nIf you have the time, walking is also not bad but account for the time it takes to get there. We are super excited to see you all there."
