On my test portal multi-language blog the forms have (Language) appended to the form name so it's easy to differentiate but on the client portal there's only a super opaque ID and the blog name - but the blog name is the same for all versions of the multi-language blog. The mind boggles, but trial and error should solve this. Thanks"
