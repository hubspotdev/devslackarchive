Is there anyway this Font Family setting could instead be added to the website area at all?\n\nI know for a lot of client sites we are always accessing the google font library and if this was something that could be set globally we could then use something `{{company.font.name}} or {{company.font.size}} or {{company.font.weight}}`",
