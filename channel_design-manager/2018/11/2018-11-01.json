It looks like we can multi-select templates within a folder to copy, but if we try to copy the parent folder or a folder with subfolders and templates that the copy option is greyed out. Is this intentional? Looks like we would have to copy each group of templates manually rather than being able to copy the whole thing like we could in DMv1. And this is *not* for purchased templates, but rather a set of templates that we custom built."
