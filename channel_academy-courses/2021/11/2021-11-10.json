    "text": "Hello everyone. I have recently started completing the course 'HubSpot CMS for Developers'. In the video, they have created a project in local environment using node.js. They have then added personal access token for it and pushed the repository to remote account using the command:\n\nnpx hs upload test-theme/src test-theme\n\nHowever, when I try to push my code using the same command, I get the following error:\n\nUnable to upload \"HubSpot\\cms_developer_demo\\test-theme\\src\\templates\\partials\\footer.html\". The post to \"test-theme/templates/partials/footer.html\" in account ****** was forbidden. This app hasn't been granted all required scopes to make this call. Read more about required scopes here: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/scopes>.\n\n I can see that in the documentation. they have a process to add scopes for oAuth but nothing related to adding  scopes when using personal access token. Is anyone able to help me out with it?"
