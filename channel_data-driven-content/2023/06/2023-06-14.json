    "text": "Hello everybody.\nI am looking to retrieve data from a form that would be in a landing page.\nThe constraints are that:\nI will have to create a form several times and I want to retrieve the data from each form independently.\nFor the moment I have already created the script which receives the data but I don't know how to send them.\nTo test my code I am using embed forms for now:\n```&lt;script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//js-eu1.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n   hbspt.forms.create({\n     region: \"eu1\",\n     portalId: \"\",\n     formId: \"\",\n     onFormSubmit: function($form, data) {\n       fetch('<http://localhost:3000/HubSpot/form>', {\n         method: 'POST',\n         headers: {\n           'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n         },\n         body: JSON.stringify(data),\n       })\n         .then(response =&gt; {\n           if (!response.ok) {\n             throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\n           }\n           return response.json();\n         })\n     }\n   });\n&lt;/script&gt;```\n\nI am therefore trying to find out how I can send the data from the forms to my server, all methods are good to take :D !!\n\nThanks in advance"

    "text": "assuming that the content selected is HUBDB driven and the resulting PDF can be templated using the same, I would say yes.. if you want the PDF to be downloadable you will need a way to template the look and feel based on the selection. a tool like <http://PDFmonkey.io|PDFmonkey.io> could do this (using the hubDB API). that PDF can either be uploaded into files and shared as a link(in email) or provided as a return URL directly from PDFmonkey. it requires integration, but certainly doable."
