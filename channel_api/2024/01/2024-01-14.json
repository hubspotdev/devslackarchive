    "text": "Hi everyone! I hope you are doing OK. I could use some help with a situation I am having with the form submission API. I'll explain: I have a custom dynamic form on a webpage where users click submit and it sends a POST request to the form submission API with the field inputs. Now, the problem is that I need to add a file field. I already added the field to the HubSpot Form, and also to the custom form. I need to take the file input value and then add it to the POST request, but I haven't figured out how. I first tried with FormData but the API only accepts JSON. Then I tried converting to base64, but it did not work either. If that scenario is possible, I could really use a working example to implement it in my project. Thank you all so much!",
