(no ETA on when we’ll do that, just something we’re thinking about)\n\nAdditionally this is a community, if you help others, others will happily help you. For context this slack community has grown rapidly over the last few years from around 500 developers to as you can see over 10,000 in this channel alone.\n\nThat means there are tons of people here who are new. Many may not have yet experienced what happens when you pay it forward yet. This community is pretty awesome when you engage with it."
