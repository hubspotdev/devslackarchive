I have a custom object associated with deals, and there are 109 deals, but when I make the GET request, it only returns 100. It provides me with the after for pagination, but I can't use the after ID to fetch the remaining 9 deals. Can you help me?"

Am I OK to simply create new properties for the data to map to, or do I need to create a custom data object? It's only a single piece of data which is being stored in the field (a time/date stamp) so I'm thinking the custom property should be fine?"

I have a serverless function that triggers whenever a show starts, but I'm trying to learn how to trigger the SMS when that function fire.\nI tried using the webhook-driven workflow, but when I send a `fetch` to the address I was given I get a 415 unspported media type error.\n\nHas anyone done something like this? TIA!"
