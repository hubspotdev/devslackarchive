    "text": "Hi everyone…\nI’m a graphic designer for a company that is using HubSpot, and although I do know how to do some coding, I’ve found myself underwater with not having some simple edits done to a HubSpot landing page that other people in my team have made… and I quickly learned that HubL is a whole different thing… which is why I’m here wondering if anyone is available to do a quick series of edits (will pay, limited budget, extremely limited time frame). The edits are only for the landing page:\ntext alignment on mobile\ndiv/column order on desktop\n\nPlease DM me if interested. Thank you.",
