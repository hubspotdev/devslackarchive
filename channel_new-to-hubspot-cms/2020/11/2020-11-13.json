    "text": "Hi <@U01DQL7AMFH>!\nThe problem is we already created a custom object “Events” which relates to deals among others.\n\nNow when we create a new deal instant it and can type in features like name etc we can’t specify it relates to this events despite having specified the connection in events.\n\nThis is then only possible once a deal is created through editing and we were wondering whether its also possible when you create a new deal as this would be one less step in the process so less likely for somebody to forget it!\n\nThank your for your help!"
