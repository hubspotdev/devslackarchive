    "text": "Hi, I'm not sure if I'm in the right channel. Thru the HubSpot interface, I'm creating a popup CTA in the new CTAs. I have a form on it and, although I just added some padding, I'm getting this flagged when I go to publish \"Form dependencies\nYou're about to publish changes to this form which may be reflected in other pages or locations using this form.\"\n\nSo I use this form absolutely everywhere. Is this really changing something on the form that's going to affect all the places? Is it going to add that padding I added in the popup interface to the main form? Little confused by this."
