Had a decent go at it today, but have found myself going in circles. I’d love it if someone could help to get me headed in the right direction. Thanks!",

    "text": "Thanks Dennis! So I have to build a landing page that looks like a comp that was given to me. There is already a template with a header and footer and I would like to use it. I started adding modules to it a quickly realized that styling and positioning the modules is not going to be simple. How do I create a group of modules that act like a &lt;div&gt; in html? I’ll need to make about 6-8 sections in the landing page, so I think if I can get one built out then I can probably figure out the rest "

    "text": "Hi <@UJ4NLTV1P> .. Welcome to HubSpot.. you can create “&lt;divs&gt;” by\n- pulling a module on the side of another one(small blue indicator will appear)\n- select a module and “right click-&gt;  group” it\n- select a module and clicking on the “create group”-button in the right side at(below the name..\n\n\nAlso if you’re brand new to HubSpot, you should take some time and do the HubSpot developer certification. You can find it in the learn center(click on your hubname in the top right and there’s a link to it). Select “Design” as category and it’s the first one which appears.\n\nIf you’re planning to do with as a HubSpot (frontend) Dev you must do this! :wink:"
