    "text": "<@U01NLJDQM8V> No problem, and to answer your question, I don't think you can sync Deals via Ecommerce Bridge to a different pipeline (as far as I know). You should be able to customise the deal stages within the auto-created Ecommerce pipeline, and you can create multiple e-commerce stores. I think that's as far as you can go with customisation of stores/pipelines/stages with Ecommerce Bridge."
