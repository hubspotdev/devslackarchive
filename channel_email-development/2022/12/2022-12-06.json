Then I wrote a piece of custom code to retrieve the contact owner via the owners api, take the first name and last name as separate elements and create a callback with 'Meeting link' set as an interpolated string to suit HubSpot's link structure.\n\nI then use that property to set a 'Meeting Link' property against the deal and call it as a personalization token in emails, sms and wherever I like thereafter :slightly_smiling_face:.\n\nI hope that helps."
