    "text": "<@UCY83QS6Q> Currently I need to do react modules to handle all kind of cases, because I can’t D&amp;G from the modules inside another module. So I need to define all of the modules explicitly or add field options to the module (Module has the other modules all ready implemented).\nCase:\nLet’s say I have a `Columns` react module, there would be 2 columns. Now, if I could specify that these columns have D&amp;G areas inside, let’s say that I need to have there accordion, or image etc, If I could just now make an `Image` module and an `Accordion` module and then I could D&amp;G those inside the `Columns` module (or other modules) from the edit view, that would be awesome. So I wouldn’t need to make a module where I have option to pass accordion (new field for it) or image etc. I could design theme modules in a component way."
