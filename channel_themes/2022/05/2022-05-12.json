Okay, so when I changed that line in the base html all the errors changes to be more specific (weird?) and said that it couldn't find child_links in \"false\", so for every macro that called a menu item I wrapped it `{% unless menu_item == \"false\" %}` and that worked!!!!! Omg you have no idea how long I have been fiddling with this. I appreciate yalls help so much!"
