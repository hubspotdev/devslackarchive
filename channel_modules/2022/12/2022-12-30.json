Yes the <http://event.object.it|event.object.objectId > has the correct client record id value.\n\nIf I just ask it to return console.log(searchCustomResponse) it returns [object object].\n\nAfter this I used the APIv4 url to call the contact-emails and contact-calls associations and that worked as expected. Can you add a sort request in that url to make it appear in descending order of creation? Thanks"
