I can confirm that the CLIENT_ID is correct and is correctly passed to the URL when making the initial request to HubSpot for the user to login and grant access. The scopes and redirect URI are also correct and initialized as recommended in devise.rb:\n\n`config.omniauth :HubSpot, ENV['HubSpot_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['HubSpot_SECRET_ID'], scope: 'crm.objects.contacts.write timeline crm.objects.companies.write crm.lists.write crm.lists.read crm.objects.deals.write crm.objects.contacts.read' unless !ENV['HubSpot_CLIENT_ID']`\n\nIs anybody else experiencing this? I’m pretty stumped as I’ve tried various changes and cannot get HubSpot to recognize our client as valid.\n\nThank you in advance!"
