I would like to explain a little bit our use case.\nWe have a Deal created in our system associated to two companies, one with association label, let's say Buyer, and the other one with association label \"Seller\". This deal is an opportunity created from our team.\n\nThen a ticket is created in our system automatically if an activation is requested and this ticket is also associated with Company A (label = Buyer) and Company B (Seller) and what I am trying to do is check if the companies associated of this created ticket match with the same companies from our previous deal, matching the labels.\n\nI tried to see if exists any query in API HubSpot to retrieve all the Deals from a specific pipeline and see for which label company record id is associated\n\nMaybe any query that search a deal with the same companies associated that the ticket has"

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.
