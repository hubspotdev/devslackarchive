So JS modules would show up in the page editor add module sidebar, they can be dragged into D&amp;D areas, clicked into and edit field values in the sidebar, etc\n\n*: Caveat, some of this might not be 100% buttoned up for the start of our private beta (ya know, classic early alpha stuff, etc) but again the idea we’re going for is that how you code a module is an implementation detail that doesn’t change how a marketer/content creator interacts with it in the HubSpot product"
