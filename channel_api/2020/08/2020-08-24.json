The docs in v3 do not indicate the expected behavior on an error.",

It seems that the email events also have the transactional emails after all although it is not very clearly identifiable which ones as the email events do not have a link back to email ids that created them. SO if you have email \"THIS IS MY EMAIL TEMPLATE\" with ID 3243242334 then you find no such reference whatsoever on the email events but you can find the subject of the email template for the event type SENT. So i think it got all the pieces i needed"
