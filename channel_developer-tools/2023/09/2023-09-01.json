I am creating a HubSpot app. I have a developer account for my app. \n\nWithin the developer account, you can create test accounts for testing your app. \n\nFrom the docs, it seems that each test account should have an enterprise trial — that can be renewed. However my rest accounts do not have this. So I can’t test workflows etc. \n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/account-types|https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/account-types>"
