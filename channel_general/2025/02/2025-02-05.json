Theoretically, the information should be there, as there would be a record of a call on HubSpot before the online booking went through. Do you know if it's possible to build a report on this?"

My goal is to see all campaigns a contact has participated in, along with their actions, directly within HubSpot. I tried using Zapier, but it required setting up separate Zaps for each campaign, which isn’t scalable. Has anyone successfully solved this? Would APIs allow me to connect multiple Lemlist accounts efficiently? \n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated",
