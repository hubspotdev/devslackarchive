    "text": "<@U05KMQ5CDCG> yeah the sleep function is better used when processing webhooks than workflow enrollments  - workflows that enroll tons of objects can definitely be problematic because HS will send them all at once - no way to throttle them - calling a webhook from the workflow instead of using custom code would allow you to database the webhooks and process them afterwards in batches - then a sleep function will help in that logic - I prefer this approach - I think you have to have an enterprise license to use webhooks in a workflow would be the drawback"

But Date/Time columns are stored as Microsecond Timetamp in G-Sheet. :confused:   I added a \"Data Format\" Action in the beginning of the Workflow, but this doesn't change the resulting format in the G-Sheet. Did anybody had this issue, too?  Any known pitfall?"

    "text": "Oh I like the idea about the webhooks. I didn't thing of that yet.\n\nWhen I have huge amount of records I have to run through API's I do it outside of HubSpot by creating a list in HubSpot and then looping through the list one record at a time with a sleep function between the loops. Also not the best solution and time consuming when large data set, plus you get a lot of traffic/calls on your app. But it does work quite reliable."
