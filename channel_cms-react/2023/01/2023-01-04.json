Agreed that having a hook at does things for you would be nice.\n\nThough one thing we’d need to work through on our side is authentication, because it would be a security concern to allow unauthenticated client-side API calls set any arbitrary data in your hubdb tables. Maybe there is a world were our React project build automatically creates new access tokens than these built in `useHubDbPut(…)`  and similar hooks pickup without any configuration on your part. Will need to :thinking_face:  more on that…"
