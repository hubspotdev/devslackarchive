    "text": "I have a question that I think some others might have run into as well. I am trying to update our email templates to use the new default email modules as outlined within this document: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/update-email-templates-to-use-default-email-modules>. The problem is that the new CTA IDs do not work within my templates. All the other IDs work correctly however, the CTA ID is throwing the error: \"The <@UDA553DRD>/cta module has been deprecated on email template in favor of <@UDA553DRD>/email_cta.\". es but I remember this being an issue last year and the switch on IDs needed to be numerical. For example: the linked image tags are Old: 1155231 New: 122960526478 however, the CTA switch ID is Old: <@UDA553DRD>/cta New: <@UDA553DRD>/email_cta. Does anyone know of a numerical updated IDs for CTA?",
