This first release is for the default Divider module, *<https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/divider-module-v1|more info on our changelog here>*. The current version of the divider module (the one you can use today) is what we're calling \"v0\" and the version we're releasing tomorrow is called \"v1\". When the release happens, only net new portals created will get v1 of the divider. All existing portals will continue to have v0. Existing portals will _not_ be able to get access to v1. Any questions, let me know!",
