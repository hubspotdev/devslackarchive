My idea is that I would like an inventory section where I can view all of my inventory that I have available? Is this possible within HubSpot? As from what I can see I could create an app however this would be associated to a record rather than in its own independent section which is what I would want from a reporting perspective and from a marketing aspect. Theory being if I know what I have available within the inventory I will be able to identify what is best to sell?",
