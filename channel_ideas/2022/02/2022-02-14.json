    "text": "It would be awesome if HubSpot automatically excluded site visits from people that have access to the portal, e.g. if i’m logged into HubSpot and go on any of the portals that I have access to it ignores me for reporting (the same as excluding IP addreses in the settings), I feel like excluding IP addresses was already a faff when we were working from the office but with people working from home and home IP addresses likely to change, we also have many portals that we need to add our IP addresses to.\n\nThe only other option would be for partners to have a central IP exclusions list that they can exclude from all their portals, but i’d much rather it work based on if I have access to the portal"
