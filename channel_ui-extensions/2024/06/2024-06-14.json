But I wanted to redirect the user to an external page within my function. I know I can’t use the window function and I know that there is a crmactionbutton component that would redirect the user to an external page.  But the crmactionbutton component doesn’t use onclick, not that I know of in the documentation. Which way would you recommend me using, my goal is to have a button that the user click, which trigger a function, does some calculation and then redirect the user to an external webpage",
