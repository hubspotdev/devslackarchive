So that’s one approach, but there may be a slight delay to logging in for first time --&gt; getting added to group --&gt; getting page access.\n\nSomething on our radar (with no definitive timeline or commit to being done) is adding self-reg to all content types, not just blog &amp; customer portal. That would be the ideal situation for this scenario"

    "text": "<@U04V6495U4R> I saw the the registration method and it is getting set to \"Self Registration.\" We have private content on 2 different domains and there's nothing to identify on which domain they completed the self registration in order to determine which access list to add them to. The only solution I could come up with was to use a page view trigger in a workflow for the registration page that adds them to the access group list. My concern is relying on an analytics event vs trigger directly on the form submissions from the registration form. Currently, there's no event recorded on the contact record for submitting the registration form."
