    "text": "Hi <@U02S3TC4HD1>, That entirely depends on what kind of system do you have and how you want to sync the data.\n\nLet discuss some cases.\n\n1. If your third party CRM provides some workflows that triggers whenever there is a new data or any data is updated, Then you can use HubSpot API’s to send data from your CRM. So whenever new data is created, your workflow will trigger the workflow that will send data using hubSpot API.\n2. If you don’t need to sync data after every few minutes, then you can use HubSpot workflows, that will fetch data from your CRM. In that case, you will need to consider the time and memory limitations which is I guess 20 seconds and 128mb respectively. \n3. If your CRM, does not have any workflow capabilities and you want to sync your data after every few minutes, then you can create scripts and deploy in on any server that will act as cron jobs.\n4. Lastly, you can also use some third party integration tools like Zapier to sync with CRM, considering the fact that your CRM is supported by Zapier.\n"
