    "text": "Quick question that I'm hoping there might be an answer to: We built a theme for our customers to use for their websites and then used that theme to sell in the Marketplace. I am building out an upgrade path for our customers to upgrade to the Marketplace version so they can take advantage of any updates we push out. The issue that I'm coming up against is that a large number of our website customers are using CMS Starter and that subscription level will only support one child theme. Has anyone else dealt with this particular scenario? Using Content Staging is my plan but I can't move forward without having both child themes. Would starting a CMS Pro trial be a workaround?"
