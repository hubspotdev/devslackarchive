Plus if you're a Twitch partner your content has to be exclusive to a degree in order to keep your monetization. So basically if you're looking to grow an audience, you're better off on another platform, whereas if you already have a following on something like Twitter, IG, or YouTube then Twitch is a cool place to hang out and interact with your established audience (almost like a private discord server/slack in video form)."
