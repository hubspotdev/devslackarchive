I am also not able to filter it out after getting all line items from the endpoint /crm-objects/v1/objects/line_items/paged because it has no reference of externalObjectId on the response. Please advise.",

FOr the line_item API youâ€™ll need the HubSpot assigned Id. You can get those by doing a get all line items <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/line-items/get-all-line-items> The same applies to deals but with this endpoint instead <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/deals/get-all-deals>"
