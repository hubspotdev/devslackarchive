That same theme is used in another HubSpot instance (Instance B) and a site is built on it's child theme. We'd like to update the parent theme in Instance B (essentially replace it with the updated theme files from Instance A). What would be the best way to accomplish this while ensuring nothing breaks with the parent-child theme relationship.",

If the theme was built correctly it shouldnâ€™t have hard coded IDs, it should be using relative paths, etc.\n\nAs long as everything is 1:1 and there are no changes (other than the ones you want to update) using the CLI is my next best way of doing that.\n\nUsing the cli allows a few commands and everything copys / pastes. I typically push changes to a demo / dev portal first to ensure everything is correct"
