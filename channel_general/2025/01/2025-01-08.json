    "text": "It appears that when HubSpot renewed our SSL certificates (was this coincidental?), a 301 redirect was added at the Cloudflare level, possibly tied to the `X-HS-Route-Prefix` header with `?page-name`. This redirect caused our Blog homepage to redirect to a  landing page on our marketing website (on a different domain).\nInitially, I couldn't resolve the issue directly. However, I discovered that appending a cachebuster query parameter (e.g., `<http://www.site-name.com/?hsCacheBuster=xxxxx|www.site-name.com/?hsCacheBuster=xxxxx>`) bypassed the cache and served the correct content. After realizing this, I requested HubSpot to clear the cache at their end.\nAs a result, the issue was resolved, but our Blog homepage was incorrectly redirected for approximately 9 hours."
