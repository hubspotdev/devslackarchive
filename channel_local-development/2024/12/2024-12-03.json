How do I update new changes in an already listed HubSpot Marketplace app?\nIn Salesforce, we create a new version with the updated features and submit it for listing, ensuring the existing live app remains unchanged until the new version is listed. Do we follow the same method in HubSpot, or is there a different process?\nPlease assist me in resolving this query.",

Before the review is completed you will be able to use our feature flag API to selectively enable for up to 5 accounts (including for your testing) and once approval is completed you will be able to enable for all existing install customers.
