Just got the drywall up, so i am really done “dreaming” and going to start “doing”\n\nI like doing woodwork stuff and things like that. I haven’t done any epoxy myself, but my brother in law is a contractor and my dad used to make high end furniture a long long time ago.. so they are going to help me out with this stuff and make sure I don’t mess anything up too much."

My wife’s more of the woodworker/shop expert, but her and I collabed on a gift for my dad who loves cribbage.\n\nCNC’d the track, poured epoxy resin with some glittery gold colored flecks, laser engraved the name, and then CNC’d again theholes in the epoxy and wood for the peggs. Also drilled a hole in the board to store the pegs inside. Project took a long while, and honestly all credit goes to my wife for being the smart one on it.\n\nThat’s about as close as I’ve ever done to what you’re doing. The epoxy was the first time both my wife and I ever did it.",
