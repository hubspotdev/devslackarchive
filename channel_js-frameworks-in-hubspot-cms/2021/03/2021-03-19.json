Ultimately, I need it for LinkedIn ad tracking as well as incorporating live chat on the site. Here is what I have went with so far:\n\n```import { Helmet } from \"react-helmet\";\n\n&lt;Helmet&gt;\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" id=\"hs-script-loader\" async defer src=\"//js.hs-scripts.com/#######.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/Helmet&gt;```\nIs this a correct approach for accomplishing what I am trying to do? Any help would be appreciated!"
