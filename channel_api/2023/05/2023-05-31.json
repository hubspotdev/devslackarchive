So far, I have figured that I can get the ID of a file and plug it into the following endpoint to get the proper downloadable signed URL:\n```<https://api.HubSpot.com/filemanager/api/v3/files/############/signed-url>```\nThen, I can download the file itself using the URL received from that endpoint as an API call with my bearer token to get the file itself (providing my same authorization bearer token as a header).\n\nHowever, I'm finding the `GET */files/v3/files/search` endpoint mentioned in the API documentation very lacking. There is no filtering for files which are specifically attached to certain companies or deals. So, I was thinking I could go through each company and get the associated files for each, and then go through each of the deals and get files for those as well. Yet, I don't see any `associations` to files/attachments anywhere in the API or documentation, or maybe I just missed that? How would one go about solving this issue so I can get the file ID's of just the files I want, perhaps with a date cut off (so I'm not re-downloading a lot of these immutable files such as PDFs to our local servers again each time)? If anyone can help, I'd appreciate the help.*"
