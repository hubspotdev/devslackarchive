    "text": "Hi Sourav, sorry I've been out sick for a couple of days and didn't see the response.\nBased on your answers you may need to update the tracking code to use the correct parameters for v3 version. In v3, HubSpot uses utm_source and utm_medium parameters to track the original source of leads. You can use these parameters to differentiate between Google and Facebook leads by setting a more specific utm_medium value for each source, such as google-organic or facebook-paid.\n\nIf it helps here is an example tracking code if it helps let me know:\n\nconst utmSource = 'utm_source';\nconst utmMedium = 'utm_medium';\n\nconst originalSourceDrillDown2 = `${utmSource}=google&amp;${utmMedium}=google-organic`;\nconst facebookOriginalSourceDrillDown2 = `${utmSource}=facebook&amp;${utmMedium}=facebook-paid`;\n\nwindow.HubSpotTracking = {\n  track: {\n    originalSource: 'google',\n    originalSourceData2: originalSourceDrillDown2\n  }\n};\n\nwindow.HubSpotTracking = {\n  track: {\n    originalSource: 'facebook',\n    originalSourceData2: facebookOriginalSourceDrillDown2\n  }\n};"

As we have used a embedded script provided by HubSpot. An embedded JavaScript code.\n\nHow can we achieve this? Please suggest.\n\nThank you again."
