I think this is v1, I'm trying to use v3. i am using a general app.use(express.json()), for this I should be using express.raw(application/json) instead of the default that I'm using? if so, does that mean that the req.body is different to the req.body I am getting now?\n\nHow will this effect getting the event data for the rest of the webhook? and finally, is this validation on for webhooks or can I use it for any endpoint send from HubSpot like CRM cards and workflow actions?"
