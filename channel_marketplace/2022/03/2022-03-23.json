But we're trying to transfer batches or multiple emails at a time.\n\nWe were using reference paths with the modules, so the emails + templates + modules + styling are all transferring. But the end user is still left to do some manual mapping b/c of some API limitations. Definitely frustrating.\n\nAppreciate your help! And if you think of anything, would love to hear it."
