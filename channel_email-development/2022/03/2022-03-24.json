    "text": "Hello. I'm trying to create feedback event files and want to create them by individual email. I notice that my email has three Internal HubSpot IDs but this langauge doesn't match the event output, which has appID and emailcampaignID. It also doesn't match the available endpoints of appID and campaignID. Should I consider the email unique identifier to be emailcampaignID? How will I query the respective email within a workflow to generate feedback events? And, suppose I have four emails that I plan to send within one workflow. Will I see four emailcampaignIDs or four campaignIDs?",
