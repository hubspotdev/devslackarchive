    "text": "Hi Kamila, while I understand you would like to start to reduce the HTTP request, I would suggest to go first on reducing the load speed as this is one is the main keys.\nYou need to check if you are currently lazy loading all the images below the fold, if not that will be your first quick but major win.\nAfter that I would check all the JS that is being loaded and executed (maybe there are third party libraries that are not that relevant anymore, or could be replaced for others more optimized). The next big step would be defer/async most if not all your JS and see in which place are you after that. These should improve by a lot your current scores.\nThe next steps would be much more time consuming as may require to rewrite your JS, move around the code and maybe even reconsider  a full rebuild on the website if the code is too tangled and not that good."
