    "text": "So the clientId and clientSecret is use from the Auth section of my developer account will never expire, even though i have no plans to list my app for others to use? Thats great news actually! I have already implemented the OAuth flow and my integration is being tested by a client of ours as we speak. I thought my developer account would be suspended after a certain amount of days too, just like the HS test accounts ive used to test my implementation before going \"live\". Cool, thanks <@UD53A9UUR>"
