I'm pretty new to HubSpot and was just following instructions so I created this email – new custom modules and all – and when they were telling me to send it out I ran into the problem that we don't have our company emails in HubSpot. We do have a company email <mailto:everyone@ourcompany.com|everyone@ourcompany.com> that will send the email to everyone. Can I use HubSpot to send the email I created to <mailto:everyone@ourcompany.com|everyone@ourcompany.com> which then gets distributed?"
