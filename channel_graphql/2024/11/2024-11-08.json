Ryan, I have talked to the team, and they had explained that any new KB that you create are still being created under the old experience; your portal is not currently enabled for the new KB experience yet until the team can complete the migration tool.\n&gt; I hope I could clarify this topic for you. Have a great day!\n... and \"the new KB experience\" is required to enable graphql against the KB dataset..."
