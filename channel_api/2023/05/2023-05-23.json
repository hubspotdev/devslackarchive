When I request with the e_visitied_page event its fine, however when I use the e_form_submission_v2 event I get the 'event-detail-read' scope is missing. The docs only say it needs the BI scope and I cannot find any reference to the event-detail-read scope other than a dead end forum post.\n\nAny help greatly appreciated : )"

I don't know if they haven't updated the Blog API, are you trying to get all the blog posts? If so I would send a request to the Blog API get all the blog posts data that you want, then make another request to the HubDB API to create the table row with the data that you got . I added both docs links, I will see if I can make a basic demo for you in a bit:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/cms/hubdb>\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/cms/blog-post>"
