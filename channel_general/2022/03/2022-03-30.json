(note: only if your deploy step has a differrent destination or source folder change its name in the deploy.sh file, mine is \"dist\" but in the docs it says \"src\" so I had to change it, it depends on your project structure)\n2. swap the deploy.yml with the bitbucket-pipelines.yml (you can find <https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines/|more info in this link> about pipelines)\n3. go in bitbucket repository menu \"pipelines\" and enable pipeline\n4. go in bitbucket repository menu \"deployments\" and add the variables as in your file."

Is there a way to build a filter page and pull in all authors? Or do I just create a Authors blog and create a post for each person that the feature image is the profile image - title is author name - and only line is their city/state and style the listing page and individually redirect every post to the individual author page (that last one seems very long and complex for something so simple).\n\nAny input would be great.
