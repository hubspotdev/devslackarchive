    "text": "Hello, I have few templates that are still in the Drag and Drop design manager. Up until last week I had used the older HTML module (the replacement for the very legacy HUBL module) to embed a newer global module into legacy templates. This stopped working for some reason. Anyone have any idea how to accomplish this as a temporary fix? The ask here was so that they could edit items in say their new global header and have the changes propagate to legacy templates still in the drag and drop design manager. For example make this show up in a drag and drop template `{% module \"module_1729874228739122\" path=\"/mytheme/modules/headermodule\", label=\"Header\" %}` Any help is appreciated.",
