    "text": "No, unfortunately.  I haven’t found a solution, so I had to use a workaround and use short-text personalisation tokens for building blocks of HTML and then build them together in a template. e.g.\n`LinkText1`: This is a Google Link\n`LinkUrl1`: <https://google.com>\nAnd then in the template, I’d edit in HTML mode and write something like this;\n```&lt;a href={{LinkText1}}&gt;{{LinkUrl1}}&lt;/a&gt;```\nThe obvious downside being that it only works with a very rigid structure.  In my case, I wanted to have one personalisation token to render an `&lt;ol&gt;` of several links, but instead I have 10 fields (5 “LinkText” fields and 5 “LinkUrl” fields) and I now have to have always exactly 5 links in my list or the template won’t be rendered correctly.  Very suboptimal solution.\n\nMy support ticket did get a response saying that there is a Rich Text type of Property that is being worked on but is not available yet which may work for this use case."
