Like if a user searches “Apple tree”, I would like for HubSpot search to crawl all blog posts in the HTML title and Meta Description to find that exact phrase together, not look for “Apple” posts first then posts with “tree” in them based on the score. I looked at the Search API documentation: <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/content/search-for-content>, but not sure if there is an “Exact match” parameter” to add to help achieve this, any help would be great appreciated.",
