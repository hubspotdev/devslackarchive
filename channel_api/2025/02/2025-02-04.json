It make senese... but I think our tracking isn't implemented well, or at all (angular, and until now, we were used only the chat plugin and broadcasted CTAs) so the code you provided was correct, but it isn't trigger the sending event to HS, so I triggered by calling a refres manually\n```window.HubSpotCallsToActions.refresh();```\nas a workaround it could work on every route change by sending this and also the identification\n```_hsq.push([\n  'identify',\n  {\n    email: '<mailto:my@email.com|my@email.com>',\n  }]);```\nOr is there any amore sophisticated solution for that in angular?\n\nAlso... do we need to call and set the HubSpot Visitor token into the chat plugin, are they in connection? Or the tracking only use the `identify` field when identifying the visitor for the CTA?"

I was wondering if it was possible to allow valid records to be uploaded and get a response of the invalid records? I am using a community written api as golang is not supported by HubSpot.
