HubSpot does\n the same in their own blog (see <http://blog.HubSpot.com|blog.HubSpot.com>)\n and I was wondering how I can replicate that since it can't be part of a\n module right? Since I also need to access that data in the listing\ntemplate. Any help or even pointers to guides/turorials are welcome,\nthank you!",

You’ll see a tracking pixel fire off, very similar to the page view one that’s there by default but with a different type value.  That will let you know in real time if your event is at least firing.  Note that it’s a pixel load specifically to avoid the CORS issue. The HTTP Events API is mostly for firing events from the back end or from a mobile app"
