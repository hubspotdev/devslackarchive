What I'm trying to accomplish is to format a number property with a dot as thousands separator and comma as decimals separator (e.g. 1.234,56).\nI tried a bunch of HubL filters but to no avail.\n\nSee the property definition, my sample code and the test email I'm receiving in the attached images.\nAnyone can tell me what I'm doing wrong? I mean, the list item NUMBER is the one I'm looking for but it works entering an actual number, not using the property. This is driving me crazy!\nThank you.",
