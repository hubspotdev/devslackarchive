However, I am also getting the user’s id so I would just run this through the crm_object function that I did above and specify that you are looking that multiselect property and you should get the name instead of the value like in my example above.\n\n That will be easier than grabbing the property and looping through all of the options until you find the one that matches the value that the deal is showing",

    "text": "We do not increase the limit on a per account basis.\n\nThe reason for the limit is that each rows request can request up to 10,000 rows, and I’m not aware of a limit on the number of columns.\n\nSo if you were to execute 10 of those requests on a page you’d be able to get 100,000 rows of data. Hurting your web page’s performance.\n\nIf you’re querying the same DB multiple times in a page, you should set the value of the HubDB queries to a variable and filter/sort the data. That enables you to limit the number of queries you’re making.\n\nAdditionally you can use JavaScript to query your HubDB data using the HubDB API and display it using JavaScript. There is no limit to how many HubDB’s you query against using JavaScript."
