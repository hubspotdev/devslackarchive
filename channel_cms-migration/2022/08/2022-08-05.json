    "text": "Hey folks!\n\nFirst time importing a WordPress blog to HubSpot. Has anyone ever successfully imported user comments?\n\nI have everything else transferred across but I cannot figure out how to do this. Tried all the different import methods (XML file upload, WordPress connect, Smart copy) but none of these seem to import them.\n\nSaw a <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C2YHAHB6K/p1554291169037800|discussion> from 3+ years ago about using the API but this (still) doesn’t allow you to set the `createdAt` date, so importing like this would not retain the original dates of each comment. Would be super grateful for any ideas or workarounds people might have used. Thanks!",

You’d need to manually recreate the theme using the HubSpot Design Tools.\n\nYou could start by cloning one of the free themes in HubSpot that's a close enough match to your WordPress theme layout and then customizing it."
