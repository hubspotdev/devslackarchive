Is there anyway to determine the order in which my custom objects show up on the Contact record?\nMade Up Example: I want to associate the owner of a pet (contacts) with their pets (custom object). For Nancy the old cat lady... she currently has 4 cats and she has had 12 cats pass away. Each cat get's added as a Custom Object and associated to Nancy. I add a secondary display property for \"Status\" so I can categorize the pets as \"Current\" or \"Previous\". But how do I get the 4 living cats to show up first when I pull up Nancy's contact record? Can I tell it to sort by \"Status\"?"
