    "text": "Hi all, is there anyway to replicate using the HubSpot API, the same re-subscription behaviour as the embedded forms if the system detects they are unsubscribed from an email type?\nFor example:\nIf a user opts out of an email subscription type, and subsequently fill in a HS embeddable form, they get the message\n\"Looks like you've opted out of email communication. Click here to get an email and opt back in.\" - if the user clicks that, they get sent an email to get their permissions again. Is this possible via the HubSpot APIs at all? I'd like to know if we have a user who fills in a form we have built that uses the HubSpot APIs, how can we leverage this check and email permission process to trigger if at all possible?"
