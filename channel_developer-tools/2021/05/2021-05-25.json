    "text": "performance wise I would actually suggest using the `require_js` HubL function and place the jQuery just inside of the modules that actually will use jQuery. (instead of in templates, that don’t themselves need jQuery)\n\nThis does a few really awesome things.\n\nAny pages that don’t have a module on them that requires jQuery - won’t load jQuery making them load faster.\n\nAdditionally if you ever decide to migrate away from jQuery it becomes a lot safer. Because you can identify all the modules that actually use it, and you’ll know nothing else is using it.\n\nI also recommend checking out <http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/>\n\nAs modern vanilla JavaScript now can do almost everything folks used to reach for jQuery for - but sometimes even easier. Best of all you don’t need to load a library. The website I linked helps you to convert from jQuery syntax to just straight JavaScript"
