Changes to look out for:\n:star: A separate page for each component\n:star: Design guidelines for each specific component within its own page\n:star: Table for prop specs for each component for easier reference\n:star: Components directly accessible through the sidebar\n:star: Clear visuals for component variants\n:star: A \"new\" tag to highlight the recently launched components\n\n*Why?*:thinking_face: We wanted all the component-related info to live together for easier reference. We know how much you use these docs and we want to ensure it's a smooth experience to build with components as we keep adding to this list:rocket:\n\n*What to expect?*:eyes:\nNo changes are needed from your side. The previous doc links should automatically be replaced by the new docs. This change is already reflected in the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/ui-components|public docs> and <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/ui-components/overview|beta docs>. The in-app docs will have this shortly.\n\nLet us know about your experience below:smile:",

This would lead to confusion about how to use the component too. We wanted to smoothen this experience\n• Previously, the design guidelines were siloed away from the components and difficult to put on a page that was already so long\n• As we expand our component set, we wanted these docs to be scalable and for it to be easy to jump from one component to the other\nWe hear you about wanting to see all the components at a glance. I have noted this feedback and am curious if this problem persists even with the Figma. Thank you for keeping us honest and looking forward to more feedback on how this experience is for you :smile:"

We've tried all the typical troubleshooting steps, clear cache, updated chrome, I also reviewed the console/network logs. I haven't looked into see if there are any extensions that conflict, but it's just strange it is only happening when the right associations bar is open on the record page.\n\nAny suggestions/thoughts?\n\nEdit: I also know that there is a 10s timeout limit on serverless functions, but doesn't seem this is related as the function is firing OK.",
