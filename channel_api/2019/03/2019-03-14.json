To save a lot of time building a new Header/Footer in blog section\n\nI would like to roughly speaking Copy my sites Header and Paste in to the HubSpot Blog Template\n\nThe reason why we need this is because, HubSpot MainMenu is module and can’t access some of exact elements. Menu dropdowns by default on hover, even there are no :hover pseudo classes in CSS file nor JS script. Major issue is with font and font-family even  writing exactly same CSS style as there is in main site, still don’t works, some font texts are either  bolder or thicker. In other words for some unknown reasons main sites exact styles and scripts  don't work  in HubSpot Header Blog module.\n\nIf there are any  ways via API ro any kind, and if there is how could it be done?",

If using email addresses, you can pass one that may or may not exist in your account yet.\n\nthe request looks like this:\n\n```[\n     {\n      \"vid\": [a valid contact id goes here],\n      \"properties\": [\n        {\n          \"property\": \"city\",\n          \"value\": \"Cambridge\"\n        }]\n        },\n        {\n        \"email\": [a valid email goes here],\n        \"properties\": [\n           {\n             \"property\": \"city\",\n             \"value\": \"Cambridge\"\n           }]\n      }\n]```\n\nYou can add up to 1000 contact’s in this JSON object, but must follow the prescribed format.
