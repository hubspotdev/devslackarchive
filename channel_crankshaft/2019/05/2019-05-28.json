    "text": "Some awesome news. I started linking up the assets, and creating a testing page/template to test aspects of the framework.\n\n*So far I think the grid is full functioning CSS Wise!*\n\nI’m going to work on writing some javascript based tests to ensure it’s working good and we can use the tests to evaluate if later changes accidentally broke the grid.\n\nThere’s still more we can do to HubLize it but we’re making good progress.\n\nIf you’re interested in writing up documentation on the grid, the grid’s css currently functions about the same as bootstrap. So we need a new page in the docs website that explains how to use it.\n<https://github.com/TheWebTech/CrankShaft/issues/51>"
