You can move forward with your listing as is. Eventually you will be able to go back and add the scopes in your app listing but that’s not necessary since you now have constructed the Auth URL that requests the scopes, which is the important part for actually making the app function"

    "text": "It's really nice that it's possible to reuse repeating patterns like buttons using macros. This way you can create a `render_button(arg)` macro and use it in other modules. But in this case you have to copy/paste the required fields to all the modules you want to use `render_button` method in. Is there a way to avoid this copy pasting? If there was a way to define `fields.json` as `fields.js` as a JS module, then we could just import the file and merge it to the `fields.js` of the module we want to add those fields.\n\nExample:\n\n```// Maybe use JS modules\n\nconst buttonFields = require(\"./buttonFields.js\");\n\nmodule.exports = [\n {\n    label: \"Some label\",\n    name: \"some_name\"\n },\n  ...buttonFields, \n];```",
