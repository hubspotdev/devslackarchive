    "text": "has anyone had a problem with blog urls where \"post.absolute_url\" doesn't use the custom domain and instead uses the development HubSpot url instead (even though the rest of the site uses the custom domain)?\n\nedit: so it appears that once you set a custom domain, it doesn't update the blog absolute urls with that custom domain. In the main blog settings where you can edit the blog root URL the dropdown for selecting the domain only includes the default HubSpot one.\n\nfinal edit: discovered the solution is that when updating domain, you have to separately update it for the blog as well. solved"
