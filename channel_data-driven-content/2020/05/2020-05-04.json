    "text": "<@UDGAX34Q6> you could make 33 custom contact properties (in their own contact group!), one for each answer (or, you could just create the ones you care most about capturing). Then you ask your developer to post the serialized user responses into the HS Forms API endpoint (using AJAX) and use that form submission in HubSpot to trigger a workflow, which sends the email, which uses those properties. I’ve used this exact approach on many occasions, it works well. Admittedly, not usually with 33 questions - biggest one I ever did was 12. But the process is the same. Downsides are the small amount of legwork creating the fields and the fact that you end up with a lot of custom contact properties, but if you name and group them sensibly it shouldn’t be a problem"
