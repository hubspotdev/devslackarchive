One is meant to have more emphasis for the main intended user action and the secondary provides another option should the user not want the directed path to keep them engaged (both designs achieve this). If for instance you are getting more clicks on the secondary - then the primary button may not be the correct path at the stage. But I'm definitely interested in what others have to say about this/what testing may have been done."
