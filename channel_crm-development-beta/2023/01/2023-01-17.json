The serverless functions included in the developer projects are using file-based method - we call it app functions, and you don’t need CMS hub for app functions. And not via endpoint (although endpoint functions will work if you have CMS enterprise).\n\nWe are looking at simplifying this for serverless functions viewpoint. However for your case, it doesn’t help. You need the beta for Marketing and Operation Hub, which is not supported yet. Can you tell me more about the use cases for Marketing and Operations Hub?\n\nIt’ll also help if you post that information on the community group <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CRM-Development-Tools-Beta/gh-p/crm-development-tools-beta> or Ideas forum"

So adding new loans adds more value to a deal. A deal is how they manage their revenue as well as invoicing and contract.\n\nFor someone to see the entirety of this, they need to click through so many different associated objects.\n\nSo, ideally, on the *contact record* (_and other objects will have slight variations of this, but I’m trying to be brief so I’m only including the contact_) we would want to display the loans that are active, some other related details from the loan properties, the deal amount, the posisble revenue, as well as have the quick links to their report PDF and their customer information inside our webapp, as well as their evaluation."

Ideally I would like to put the information into a card component so that it isn’t “flashed” and instead is just there. I haven’t gotten a solution for this working yet.
