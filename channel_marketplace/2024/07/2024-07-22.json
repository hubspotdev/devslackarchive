    "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm creating multiple themes for the marketplace. However, I'm unable to create a new branding kit for the new theme. Since there is a strict guideline for marketplace themes that all global colors should be inherited from the brand settings, I've set the brand settings for Zepia. But now I'm doing another theme. It will alter the Zepia theme brand style if I modify the brand settings. Please let me know how to overcome this situation.",
