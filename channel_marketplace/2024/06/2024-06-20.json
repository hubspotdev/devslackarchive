    "text": "Hi everyone! I hope someone can help me out :). I have a public app on the HubSpot marketplace that we're updating. Before, it had just a few scopes (deal.read, deal.write), but now we're adding more like contact.read and company.read. To publish the edited app, I changed the Shared Data section and the scopes in Auth.\n\nHowever, when I try to update the install button URL with the new scopes (Edit Listing), the Submit Review button gets disabled. Has anyone had this problem before? Do you know how I can fix it?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!",
