    "text": "<#CLJJXGTC0|local-development> - I am running into an error when trying to create a module using the local developer approach.\n\n`hs create module AnyName`\n\nyields\n\n```CLI version: 3.0.5\nnode version: v14.16.0\nplatform: windows\n\nError: EEXIST: file already exists, mkdir 'C:\\Development\\Marketing\\HubSpot\\AnyName.module'```\nThis is a fresh install of NodeJS and Windows 10 Professional. I've tried variations where I specify the destination, with each demonstrating the same error.\n\nWorth noting, it will create the folder, but none of the files that I am expecting within.\n\nInstalled the latest CLI version globally, but tried locally, producing the same results. Just getting kicked off with HS development overall, but so far the tutorials have not led me astray.  Appreciate the guidance.",
