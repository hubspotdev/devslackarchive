    "text": "Hey all!  I'm new to HubSpot too, though I have developed in Salesforce and Netsuite.  I am helping a client with existing custom module updates so need some guidance on how to do some updates and testing.  The previous devs never set up source control that I can see so do I need to pull all custom modules down to my machine and upload to my sandbox to update &amp; test?  then push back to Prod?  or if its a simple change, just change in the Design tool?  (not a good idea in Prod, I know!)  :woman-shrugging:  I've gone through quite a bit of the online training and have set up a sandbox already.  thank you!",

    "text": "Hi Sue,\n\nSo yes best practice would be to test in a sandbox environment first before publishing your changes. That said, yes you can also make the edits in the Design Manager.\n\nWe have doc that explains creating an efficient development workflow - and it does talk about setting up version control. I would recommend when your team has time to review that and find the workflow that will work best for your team long term.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/creating-an-efficient-development-workflow>"
