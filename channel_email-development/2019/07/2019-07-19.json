I.e., if I wanted free users to be able to buy/download email templates I made for the drag and drop editor. Just so that free users aren't limited to the 15 default templates?"

We need to make sure we have a SUPER SOLID foundation + get all marketplace templates to work well with the drag-and-drop editor (not all play well as of today) before we open that up.\n\nWe consciously decided to keep it limited to start... and think about potentially expanding over time.\n\nSo it's possible, but there's still lots of foundational work before we'd get serious about open it up :slightly_smiling_face:"
