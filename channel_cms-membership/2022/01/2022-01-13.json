    "text": "The registration process is painful as you can't re-send the registration email via workflow and has to be sent manually. I've been patiently waiting for resolution to the registration challenge. Don't get me wrong, I love the new membership feature. It's awesome and opens the door for some pretty cool stuff. However, HubSpot delivered us a brand new \"Mercedes\" and forgot to give us the keys or put gas in the tank! <@U02MK065QB1>, do me a favor and go upvote this idea in the community. *<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Send-Membership-registration-email-via-workflow/idi-p/440036>*"
