Default HubSpot blog, or any custom blogs) for now this seems to work, but is a bit of a hack, and horrible on your database :smile::\n\n\n```{% set blog_id = module.blog_field %}\n{% set ee = blog_popular_posts(blog_id,1) %}\n{{ee[0].parentBlog }}```\n\nMay be missing something blatent - can’t seem to find it in docs though."
