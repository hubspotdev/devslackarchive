    "text": "&gt; I would need to set steps to the workflow - first to assign the distributor and next to send the followup email?\nRight — if you were initially planning on sending a simple follow up directly from the landing page/form, that would be risky because the email _could_ go out before the system updates the Distributor info (it would be unreliable at best). Technically there’s no set delay for either workflows or follow up emails, they just process as soon as they can (and as soon as criteria are met, in the case of workflows). A workflow which assigns the Distributor and then send the email would be the best setup. :slightly_smiling_face:"
