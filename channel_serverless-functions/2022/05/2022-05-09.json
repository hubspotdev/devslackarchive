Could you deploy the app to <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/account/set-up-a-HubSpot-sandbox-account|sandbox> [Hs] and to production [Hs]?\n\nHubSpot sandboxes end up with a different Portal ID than their production counterpart, so you could potentially use environment variables on the app side to differentiate between `dev` and `prod`"
