I would personally be okay with it just returning the form id if it’s too hard to give it all the same options as custom modules get.\n\nI realize it may not be a super common use case but could see it being useful for dynamic pages.\n\nFor my specific use case that it’d be handy right now - I’m building an SPA that has to load different HS forms based on the HubDB row. We’re just going to enter the form id’s as text input to work around the missing form field. Not a big deal but not as convenient.",
