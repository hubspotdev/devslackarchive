    "text": "Hi guys, I'm back with another question. In our custom CRM card we are rendering an iframe where the user fills out a form containing three dropdowns and upon submitting the form the values of each field are appended to the URL redirecting the user to a separate more specific form based off their initial form submission. this is working fine as a stand alone HS page, however in the CRM card iframe are being blocked by what seems to be an HubSpot security measure.\n\nI get this error in the console when attempting to fill out the form in the frame `Uncaught DOMException: Failed to set the 'href' property on 'Location': The current window does not have permission to navigate the target frame to '<https://9041361-hs-sites-com.sandbox.hs-sites.com/crm-card-view#https://app.HubSpot.com/tearlab-flex-agreement-addendum>'.`\nas well as this error `Unsafe attempt to initiate navigation for frame with origin '<https://app.HubSpot.com>' from frame with URL '<https://9041361-hs-sites-com.sandbox.hs-sites.com/crm-card-view>'. The frame attempting navigation of the top-level window is sandboxed, but the flag of 'allow-top-navigation' or 'allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation' is not set.`\n\nI have tried inserting 'allow-top-navigation' on the sandbox prop of the iframe, and this navigated the entire page to the destination rather than just the iframe I also tried adding  'allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'  to the sandbox prop of the iframe and that yielded no change.\n\nHas anyone ever ran into this issue before/have any hypothesized solutions?",
