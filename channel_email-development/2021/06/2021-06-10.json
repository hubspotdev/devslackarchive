Or place the code into a custom module which is placed at the top(like a logo bar or so if you have something like this). \nIf you're using \"static\" HTML mail Templates, drop the same code in the &lt;head&gt;-tag.\n\nNote: You'll most likely need something special for almost every email client or at least something generic for.

But since this doesn't work for emails, is there a way to do this with HubL in a Template? Thanks",
