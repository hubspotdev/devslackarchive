    "text": "Hello, I’m Prasad, a Carnegie Mellon AI PhD. With two other CMU alums, we’ve developed a new AI-driven adaptive lead scoring solution. I’m looking for beta testers who are willing to test it out (free) in exchange for some feedback.\n\nOur tool learns from your HubSpot customer data and tells you in advance how likely a lead is to convert, it can also evaluate all your existing campaigns to help you easily identify what’s effective vs. what isn’t.\n\nDM me or email *<mailto:pchalasani@xaipient.com|pchalasani@xaipient.com> *if you’re interested in taking it for a spin. You should be using HubSpot for at least a year for your marketing+sales and have at least 1000 contacts (otherwise our AI dragon won’t have enough data to work with)."
