    "text": "Hey all, for those using a webpack setup, I want to share the “HubSpot Laravel Mix” Extension i recently built\n<https://www.npmjs.com/package/@igomoon/HubSpot-laravel-mix>\n\nFor those unaware Laravel Mix is a wrapper around webpack that allows easier setup. It was built for laravel as the name indicates but it is can be used for any project.\n\n&gt;  Don’t worry about researching the necessary webpack loaders and plugins. Instead, install Mix...\nEG.\n```mix.js('src/app.js', 'dist')\n   .sass('src/styles.scss', 'dist');```\n*HubSpot extension takes this a level further!*\n\n```mix.HubSpot({\n\tLabel: 'My Theme',\n\tUpload: {\n\t\toutputFolder: 'dist',\n\t\tdest: 'theme-folder',\n\t\tpatterns: [\n\t\t\t{ from: 'src/hubl', to: 'hubl' },\n\t\t\t{ from: 'src/theme.json', to: 'theme.json' },\n\t\t\t{ from: 'src/resources/images', to: 'assets/images' },\n\t\t\t{ from: 'src/resources/icons', to: 'assets/icons' }\n\t\t]\n\t},\n\tFieldsJs: {\n\t\textraDirsToWatch: [\"./src/fields\"]\n\t}\n})```\nIt will handle your `copy-webpack-plugin` needs, uploading to HubSpot, adds a custom OS Notification and also includes the latest version (1.3.0) of <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@igomoon/HubSpot-fields-js|HubSpot Fields JS>",
