Because like bank robber Willie Sutton sort of said, *\"That's where the money is.\"* ( <https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/02/10/where-money-is/>) Hopefully, that's where the clients be - companies that need a content strategy implemented, companies that need HubSpot better implemented and companies who need help with the Design Manager and HubSpot's very different way of doing html pages."

Find the one that most fits your needs and post there (like this channel is perfect for introducing yourself).  It can get quite distracting for someone to post a message in every channel they can find. Appreciate the enthusiasm though"
