    "text": "Hello everyone,\nI am looking into using the imports API in an upsert mode and wondering if there is a way to get the `hs_object_id` of the updated records and created records mapped with email for contacts object.\n\n1 way I found to do this would be that after the import is completed : Use the createListFromImport flag, I would fetch the contacts that got added to the list. First, make a GET request to `/crm/v3/lists/{listId}/memberships/join-order` to get the record IDs of the list members. Then, make a POST request to `/crm/v3/objects/{object}/search` for the specific objectTypeId and include the record IDs in the values parameter. I am guessing the search API would still be batched so would have to do multiple throttled calls to the search API.\n\nIs there any other way to get the `hs_object_id` of what records has the imports API updated and what new records has it created?",

    "text": "Hi Everyone\nJunior web dev here.\n\nIm looking to batch create tags for blog posts and subsequently update >100 posts using the API.\nI've found two possible solutions - 1 from the docs and 1 from the community.\nBut i still have a couple of questions:\n1. Batch create tags - Do i need to include all the parameters in my tag objects or can i just include the name of the tag, tag id, and date created? (see below)\n{\n  \"deletedAt\": \"2024-06-14T11:41:38.455Z\",\n  \"created\": \"2024-06-14T11:41:38.455Z\",\n  \"name\": \"string\",\n  \"language\": \"af\",\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"translatedFromId\": 0,\n  \"updated\": \"2024-06-14T11:41:38.455Z\"\n}\n\n2. Update blog posts with new tags - Is this the best method? (see below)\n```import requests\nimport json\n\n# Set up authentication credentials\napi_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\nheaders = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + api_key}\n\n# Set up data for API call\npost_id_list = [123, 456, 789]  # list of blog post IDs to update tags for\ntag_list = ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3']  # list of tags to add to blog posts\n\n# Loop through blog post IDs and add tags\nfor post_id in post_id_list:\n    url = f'<https://api.hubapi.com/blogs/v3/blog-posts/{post_id}/tags>'\n    data = {'tags': tag_list}\n    response = requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=data)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        print(f'Successfully updated tags for blog post {post_id}')\n    else:\n        print(f'Error updating tags for blog post {post_id}: {response.text}')```\nPlease let me know if you have any tips or documentation which could help in my understanding.",

Yes?  Then there are a couple API calls you could make - one to see the status of the import (/crm/v3/imports/{importId}) and one to see the list of objects (/crm/v3/lists/{listId}) -- again I have never used this API so I could be totally off-base here.
