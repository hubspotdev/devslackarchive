Optional stuff is first and last name. Then you have permissions and teams. I’d advise setting up these in HubSpot, then getting the ids of them through the UI (click on team then get the id out of the url)\n\nThis will help assign them to the correct place. \n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Create-a-user-using-the-API/m-p/227311|https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Create-a-user-using-the-API/m-p/227311>\n\nIf you have something specific to add let me know and I can add more details "
