    "text": "In terms of number of links/columns, I think 4 menus with 5 links each is plenty - generally speaking (general, because it really depends on site, but you can’t predict that if you’re making a template for the marketplace). Especially if each of those columns also have a header to indicate what the column links are, like “Resources,” “Products,” etc. I don’t think footers should be massive in terms of links. <http://HubSpot.com|HubSpot.com>, for example, is a massive site but has a setup like you describe for the footer.\nIf you’re looking for more concrete, research-based guidance, I’d highly recommend searching the articles at <http://nngroup.com|nngroup.com>. Tons of great info there."

With the most flexible solution (which would allow the user to easily delete menus/resize the amount of space they take up interactively) they would need to setup a menu per column. I was concerned this would pollute/crowd the Menu section in the site settings. However, maybe this is something I shouldn’t worry about!"
