The template side  is the design manager, it encompasses both coded and drag n drop templates.\nIf they have a coded template, you could either create a custom module and have a repeater inside of it, or there’s kind of a ghetto trick where you can have an input field for a number(for number of items you want to add to the page)\n\nThen you can do a for x in previous input field\n\nnew field for whatever content you want repeated, but the field name needs to be generated by the loop, it cannot match any repeated items or it will not work properly.\n\nI advise just making a custom module and using the custom module’s tag. way faster way easier"
