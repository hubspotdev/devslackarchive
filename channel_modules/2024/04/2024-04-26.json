    "text": "Hello, I am looking for an idea how to ceate a global pattern for group with all button fields and reuse it through the modules just by calling it somehow and not copy paste on each module. The only kind of solution i found is probably using <https://github.com/iGoMoon/HubSpot-fields-js|HubSpot-fields-js plugin>, but not pretty sure how it works. Does anybody have a working example to share with me?\n\nAlso will be really thankful if someone give me a little feedback about pros and cons of using HubSpot-fields-js and fields.js method at all. Still not pretty sure if it is better than fields.json and is it worthy to implement it my working process\n\nThanks in advance"
