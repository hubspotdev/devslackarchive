So I tried using a private app token, but that also does not work. So I tried creating a public app using my dev portal, but that ALSO does not work.\n\nI’m at a loss here, HOW are you supposed to work with this API?",

From what I understand, we can either sync lifecycle stage or form submission to google ads, but lifecycle stage is much easier for us to customize for reporting.\n\nOur problem is that we have 2 separate products with identical lifecycle stages, but we still want to know which product was converted on Google ads platform. Our current solution is to create 2 sets of lifecycle stage values (for example `MQL product A`, `MQL product B`, and so on), but I wonder if there is a more elegant way to do this, for example syncing an extra property (`product type`) to google ads?",
