The reason we would like to pass custom parameters to cta buttons is to track how many times it will be shared on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn. Currently we have used an anchor tag for it but since we would like to track some URLs from our site we have to shift in using cta buttons. Will that still works for it?"
