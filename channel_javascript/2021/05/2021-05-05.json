    "text": "Hey there - is there a way to include form field values via a JS script WITHOUT handling the entire submission?\n\nI have a HS form with hidden fields. I want to populate these two particular fields with data available on the submission page, which will be dynamic. But I want to do this without having to handle the entirety of the submission.\n\nI guess I could use an onChange on another one of the form fields to trigger the hidden field population but this seems inelegant. Anyone have a better idea?",
