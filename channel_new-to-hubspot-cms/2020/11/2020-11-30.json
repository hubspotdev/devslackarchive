    "text": "Hi everyone.\nWe have set up Landing Pages in our HubSpot account (Marketing -&gt; WebSite -&gt; Landing Page). It has tracking code script inside and it's ID is the same as our account ID. Contact form in the landing page correctly adds contact to the CMS.\nThe problem I have is that the only cookie in the browser is `__hs_opt_out` , and I'd for sure want at least the `HubSpotutk` .\nAlso, the said Landing Page does not seem to count the visitors correctly, there are no page views recorded since two weeks ago.\n\nDoes anyone at least have a hint of what did we miss in setting up?"
