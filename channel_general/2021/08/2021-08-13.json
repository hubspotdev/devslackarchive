Im noticing now that adding a query param on any hs site is no longer bypassing the cache. Adding hsDebug is. But the issue is that this version of the site then gets cached and displayed to visitors.\n\nThis is kind of an issue because  we def use hsDebug to sometimes display data objects to help with debugging variables. Not to mention sites that use query parameters to change the content of the page.\n\nAny thoughts?",
