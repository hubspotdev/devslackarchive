I would be checking if you have to deploy your serverless functions first. Some folks in the past participated in a beta that requires deploying after uploading the serverless files."

The reason for the deploy step is that this beta was so developers could introduce custom packages to use in their functions. So to be able to build with those custom packages we needed a deploy step.",
