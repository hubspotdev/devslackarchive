However, my client wants to keep these landing pages contained within HubSpot's ecosystem.\n\nCan we use <https://go.livplasticsurgery.com/en-us/hair-transplant|this page> as an example?\n\nLet's say I want to add the code to set a trigger to the Learn More button. Can this be done within HubSpot's CMS back end? Such as pasting the code in the HTML footer? (Screenshot attached). I am struggling to know where to add the custom code for this. I am very limited in coding knowledge but can get around if pointed in right direction.\n\nWould I have to add your code to an editor like Brackets and then paste the new code in HubSpot?  I appreciate your time.",

I'd like to change the code to open the chat bot. Is this where I add your code? Once I change that, it's been updated?",
