    "text": "Currently horizontal alignment is limited to modules not columns (and only a few default modules support horizontal alignment).\n\nIf you are not at the level of a `dnd_section` (which can have a `max_width` pixel value) and the `form-card` module doesn’t support horizontal alignment itself, then the best you can do might be to have a left and right  empty “spacer” modules each with `width=3` around `form-card`"
