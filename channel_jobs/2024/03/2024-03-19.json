    "text": "Hi all. I am a HubSpot freelancer with 6+ years of experience in the platform (not a dev however). As well as offering my freelance services, I am currently building a start-up and would love the opportunity to speak to current customers of HubSpot for research, to help me build a better product. In particular if you’ve recently onboarded to the platform with a freelancer/partner agency, or recently hired a freelancer/partner agency to help implement a project that involves working with HubSpot.\n\nTo stress, this is not a sales call at all. I would only like the opportunity to ask you a few questions about the pain points (if any) you face to make sure the product adds the most value.\n\nPlease connect with me on on LinkedIn, or message me on here: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewaire/>",
