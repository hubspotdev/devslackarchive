This works great. However in the Navigation (expanded and circled in screenshot) I use the same markup in a for loop    `{% set rec_posts = blog_recent_posts('7249483386', 4) %}` and `{% for content in rec_posts|sort(False, False, 'publish_date') %}` the problem i'm having is that it only shows in a 4 grid in the nav, therefor it grabs the 4 last posts and then displays those correctly, but it leaves out the other two which really should be shown first. Is there any way to have it grab the first 4 listings on the overview page? Sorry, confusing.",
