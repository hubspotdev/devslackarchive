When I try to submit, it gets submitted on sometime and it is not submitted for sometimes. I suspect that if there are multiple form submission happens from the same IP / region, HubSpot is blocking the Form Submission. Why I came to this is that when I click submit button, No URL like (<https://forms.hsforms.com/submissions/v3>) is not being called from the browser and no  error code is returned in browser console as well. please help me to fix this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Selva D"

On the \"App info\" tab, You will be prompted to fill out some basic information about your app. This includes name, description, logo, etc.\n3. Lastly, in the \"Auth\" tab, you will be provided with a Client ID &amp; Client secret (used in the next step). To ensure your app is compatible with this sample app, set the \"Redirect URL\" (\"<http://localhost:3000/oauth-callback>\" for Node), and select \"Contacts\" from the \"Scopes\" list.\n4. Copy the .env.template file into a file named .env in the folder of the language you want to use. For example:\n```cp node/.env.template node/.env```\n1. Paste your HubSpot Client Id and HubSpot Client Secret as the value for HubSpot_CLIENT_ID and HubSpot_CLIENT_SECRET in .env\n2. Follow the language instructions on how to run. For example, if you want to run the Node server:\n```cd node # there's a README in this folder with instructions\nnpm install\nnpm run dev```\n"

It was a simple redesign with content staging, <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/website-pages/redesign-and-relaunch-your-site-with-content-staging|similar to this process>. Many of the links (done using ‘one of your pages’ to ensure the page is attached to an ID) disconnect after the push from staging to live. After the push, in edit mode, the page ID is highlighted in red like the page doesn’t exist, but it does exist. The fix is for our team to go back into edit the page and reconnect the link. Not a big lift for small site, but for a large site, it’s extremely time intensive and doesn’t reflect well to our clients. My expectation is that the links stay, well, linked :smile: Has anyone else experience this issue recently?",

The one issue our team would have in linking to the live version of the page rather than the staged, is that those links wouldn’t provide a great user experience during internal/client QA in that all links would direct to the old pages, rather than the new staged. But using the “external” in hopes that HubSpot automatically changes them over to “content” may be something. I really wish this workaround wouldn’t be the case, but it may be the best route.
