    "text": "Hello! Sorry if it's not the right channel, but it is related to data-driven in the end.\nHas anybody implemented successfully a *Lead Score* in HubSpot? Especially using the *HubSpot Score* *property -* but it can be with any other way. We have being trying to use this for a while but there's always some problem, mainly because we have so many different emails, LPs, contents, etc.\n\nWe're not sure if the problem is how the data is structured, if it's the limitation of the property or something else.\nIn case somebody has created this and it's working well in the company, I'd appreaciate a lot a quick talk about it. Or if you're using another provider for this solution that connects well with HubSpot, it would be good to know also. Thanks and have a great day.",
