    "text": "Hey Everyone!\n\nWe know a major point in feedback from you (our developer community) has been better consistency across HubSpot’s APIs for some time now. We want to make sure we are building a lovable platform for developers, so we’ve embarked on a plan to bring a baseline level of consistency to ALL of our public APIs. *Today, we are excited to announce the first stage of this initiative* *with the developer preview release of the CRM v3 API*.\n\nYou can read more about this on our changelog: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/crm-api-v3-developer-preview-is-now-available>\n\nPlease provide your feedback about these new APIs in the developer forum thread located here: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/CRM-API-v3-Developer-Preview-is-Now-Available/m-p/313608>",
