We plan on releasing a new version of our app, and I wanted to confirm the flow with the new Marketplace:\n1/ Create a new app on our Developer account, build, test and release.\n2/ Create a listing for the new app, submit it for review.\n3/ Once the new app is validated, retire the previous listing.\n4/ The previous app, while not listed anymore, would still exist while we migrate our customers to the new package.\nThank you for your help!",
