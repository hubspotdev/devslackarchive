    "text": "in other news. when using dynamic pages. lets say I have the url /staff/bob.  Simple enough to have a conditional to check if they only enter /staff to display one thing and if they enter /staff/bob it displays another (ideally the contents from Bob's row).\nHowever let's say they enter /staff/sdafsafasd . It seems that HubSpot only knows to send that to a 404 since a row with name sdafsafasd doesn't exist. Is there a way to have HubSpot handle that a little better by either A) simply displaying the contents of /staff instead or B) redirecting to a custom page that says something like \"that's an unknown staff member, but here's a list for you to choose from\""
