Let’s say I have 100 pages I want to stage; I have to go to the staging -&gt; (change the subdomain) -&gt; find a page -&gt; hit stage button -&gt; click stage cloned page -&gt; click stage page -&gt; let load -&gt; hit exit -&gt; (change the subdomain), repeat. Would be nice to be able to batch stage pages with checkboxes like you can with publishing staged pages."
