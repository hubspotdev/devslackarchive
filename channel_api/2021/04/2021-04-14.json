This is something that the PieSync team is working on but I don't have a timeline as too when this will happen.\n\nThe <#CBNDYJJAZ|jobs> channel is a great place to connect with HubSpot developers if you need to build a custom integration in the interim.\n\nAlso I noticed some solutions like <http://cloudpipes.com|cloudpipes.com> who look like they may sync deals."
