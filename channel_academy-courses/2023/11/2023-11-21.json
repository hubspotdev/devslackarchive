    "text": "Hi Guys,\n\nHope you are doing well.\n\nI am new to HubSpot and want to learn web development.\n\nAfter going through the out-of-the-box functionalities, I feel that to incorporate the custom design in HubSpot I need to create custom modules and use them on the website.\nPlease suggest if I have the wrong understanding.\n\nFor example, to create the following calculator on the website I need to create a calculator module and use it.\n\nPlease suggest to me which certification or courses I need to cover to have this skill (To create configurable modules in HubSpot).\n\nThanks :slightly_smiling_face:",
