I have tried but without any luck.\n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Email-Marketing-Tool/Personalized-token-render-HTML-correctly-in-marketing-email/td-p/989631|Here> is a list of all the things I have tried.\n\nWith the unescape hml. This is content of custom module (drag&drop module in my email).\n```<p>Escape string:</p>\n{% set escape_string = 'Visit our &lt;a href=&quot;<https://apify.com/store&quot;&gt;Apify> Store&lt;/a&gt;' %}\n{{ escape_string|unescape_html }}\n\n<p>Escape string advisor:</p>\n{{ contact.advisor|unescape_html }}```\nI think I miss some important thing but I can't find it.\n\nI would appreciate any help!",
