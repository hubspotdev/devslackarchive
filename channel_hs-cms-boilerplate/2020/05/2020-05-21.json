Would it be more for locking down pages from a developer perspective where marketers shouldn't have as much control over the layout?"

    "text": "Well the biggest issue i am facing with dnd templates is the lack of use with Dynamic pages. for example if i was to open a dnd template and change all of my tags and photos using {{dynamic_page_hubdb_row.....}} tags, it will all adjust accordingly. The moment you open the page in the front end dnd side, everything disappears and will NOT reappear."
