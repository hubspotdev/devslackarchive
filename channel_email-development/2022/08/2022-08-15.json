I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to use my own-coded emails and still I’m not able to create a custom email. I tried creating an HTML+HubL template and a Global Module in the Design Manager, but they never appear in the email creation page as part of my templates repository. The template and the module are published.",

The problem in our case is that our IP timezone data has an incorrect distribution compared to the country/timezone data in our product database. I'm wondering if we could use our own timezone data for sending emails. Any ideas on how to do it? Thanks in advance :slightly_smiling_face:",
