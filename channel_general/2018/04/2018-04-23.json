    "text": "Quick one Just wondering if anyone has an idea for this. I have created a porfolio type of page. And added Id elements to each topic so the client can send just the set category out via email but all on the same page.  <http://info.tribalgroup.com/tribal-empower-conference-breakout-sessions#Further-Education>  so this link should only show the main ones in green but shows them all. But once you click Further Education again it works fine. Any Ideas?",
