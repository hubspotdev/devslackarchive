Also do you need the object instance to be created and then send a form related to that specific custom object record?

We're using Ops Hub Enterprise but could use some guidance on the most effective approach for setting up a *HubSpot-to-HubSpot webhook.*\nAny insights, experiences, or suggestions from the community would be immensely helpful.

The UI makes us believe that they are storing it on two different properties on the backend but unsure.\n\nExample: I just want the number in the box vs both.",
