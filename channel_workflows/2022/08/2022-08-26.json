    "text": "Hey everyone, I have a subscription-based workflow which main task is to send a webhook. I noticed the subscription has the property `hs_next_payment_due_date` , however I haven’t been able to get it when the workflow calls the webhook. On the other hand, if I test the action manually it does appear there. Have you had any similar issue? Could it be a property derived from something else and therefore it’s not immediately available?",
