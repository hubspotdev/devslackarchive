    "text": "I'm having difficulty with the concept of going through the OAuth flow for webhooks. I have set up an app and an associated webhook under a development account. The test is working, in that I receive the test object at my secure endpoint. I have set up an Oauth flow for the app. I can \"seemingly\" approve the app through OAuth so that my HubSpot Enterprise account can use it. But no webhooks get issued (Deal creation in this case). I assume perhaps it has something to do with the refresh tokens?  It's not obvious who or what process would be responsible for issuing them or how they would be submitted in the instance of a webhook which is essentially a push notification. I see no detailed documentation for this process.",
