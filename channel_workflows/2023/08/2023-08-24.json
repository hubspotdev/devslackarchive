All the information I need is stored in the contact form.\nI also need to add a label to the company.\nI've gone back to the doc, I've done some research on the internet, this Slack etc. I haven't found anything conclusive. All my codes have an error.\n\nFor example, I often get this error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'basicApi')\n\nBut the code comes from a script I found on this Slack site.\n\nIf anyone has encountered this problem and can help me find a solution, I'd love to hear from you.\n\nthanks a lot !",

But if it follows the same convention as the others, you could try passing the toObjectType as the first parameter in your request, like so:\n```let toObjectType = \"contact\"  \nHubSpotClient.crm.companies.associationsApi.create(toObjectType, associationSpec)```\nWhat I’d recommend is to try using the latest v4 associations endpoint. A request similar to your own, using the client might look like the following:\n\n```let companyId;\nlet contactId;\nlet data = {\n\tinputs: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttypes: [{ associationCategory: \"USER_DEFINED\", associationTypeId: 280 }],\n\t\t\tfrom: { id: companyId },\n\t\t\tto: { id: contactId }\n\t\t}\n\t]\n};\nconst fromObjectType = \"company\";\nconst toObjectType = \"contact\";\n\ntry {\n\tconst apiResponse = await HubSpotClient.crm.associations.v4.batchApi.create(\n\t\tfromObjectType,\n\t\ttoObjectType,\n\t\tdata\n\t);\n\n\tconsole.log(\"response\", apiResponse);\n} catch (err) {\n\tconsole.error(err);\n}```\n"
