    "text": "Hey everyone! We added a minor version (v1.5) for boilerplate (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/releases/tag/v1.5.0>) which includes a bunch of features including supporting mobile breakpoints, using the new HubSpot CMS Deploy GitHub action, an example license file, a QA test template, some performance/accessibility updates and more (more details in the version link above). We also created a project board for version 1.6 here (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/projects/6>) with the goal of addressing some Google Lighthouse suggestions and general enhancements if you're interested in contributing."
