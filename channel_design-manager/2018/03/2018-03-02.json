To list everything, you can pretty print the field with `{{ page_by_id(module.page_field) | pprint }}`. It sounds like what you want is something like `{{ page_by_id(module.page_field).absoluteUrl }}`"

Or there needs to be an option added to the Actions menu to \"Move Template(s)\" so that we can more easily move templates between folders and to move more than 1 at a time. As we go to reorganize everything it's proving to be pretty cumbersome. \n\nAs a side note; can we use FTP access to rearrange templates or is that still limited to just File Manager??"
