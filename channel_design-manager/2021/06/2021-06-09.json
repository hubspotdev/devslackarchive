    "text": "so I have noticed that when making a choice field if you do not specify a placeholder it will have search by default as something that populates the dropdown. If I set the placeholder to “” in the fields.json file it will make it blank space but still be selectable. Is there a way to just not have it appear as a choice in the select dropdown? It seems like a bug to put “search” as the default if place holder is not specified and is there any way to just have my two options show in the drop down and only those two options?",
