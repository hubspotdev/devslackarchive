    "text": "BREAKING NEWS\n\nProblem is solved.\n\nIt looks like this is a HubSpot system issue and not related to my template in particular. It seems HubSpot is automatically adding all Google Font weight variants and subsets if the font-family is specified in the CTA button CSS: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/cos-general/how-do-i-add-google-fonts-to-my-new-landing-pages>. That's pretty heavy:\n\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:100,100i,200,200i,300,300i,400,400i,500,500i,600,600i,700,700i,800,800i,900,900i&amp;subset=greek,greek-ext,devanagari,khmer,gujarati,myanmar,hebrew,thai,kannada,vietnamese,latin-ext,korean,cyrillic,gurmukhi,tamil,malayalam,arabic,bengali,cyrillic-ext,telugu,sinhala,oriya\"&gt;\n\nAnyway, I am using a maximum of 3 font-weight variants in my template (light, normal, bold) but HubSpot is adding everything in the CTA button.\n\nI fixed it by removing the \"font-family:Poppins, sans-serif;\" rule from my button's CSS, so HubSpot does no longer load that font again with all those variants and subsets, since Poppins is already referenced in the theme CSS stylesheet."
