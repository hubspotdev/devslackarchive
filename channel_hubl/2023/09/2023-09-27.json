The search query is this:\n{% set query = query ~ \"&amp;question__icontains=\"~request.query_dict.search|urlencode ~ \"&amp;answer__icontains=\"~request.query_dict.search|urlencode %}\nwhere \"request.query_dict.search|urlencode\" is the input field where the user types in the text to be searched for\nThanks"
