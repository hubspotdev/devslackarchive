I have looked, but i can't find the beta you are talking about.\nI think you refer to the beta: [Public Beta] Customize 'Create record' form by pipeline\nThis helps when when creating a record within HubSpot.\nBut i'am looking for a way to do this when a ticket is created from the customer portal (so within HubSpot forms)."
