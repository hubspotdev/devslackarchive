    "text": "Hi there, I am curious to know if it is possible when using a HUBDB table to have the end user select multiple \"categories\" (women specific grants, grants by state, etc are drop downs in our hubdb table) from that table? Right now you can select one option but I'm hoping that we can allow the end user to select one or more  for example grants by state &amp; women specific grants and have the URL reflect that they selected multiple categories. Is this something where using a child table relationship is the best option? And ideally when it comes to the state category we would like it to only show options that are within the state that they select",

    "text": "Hey Riley - it sounds like what youre really looking for, if im understanding your question correctly, is some custom filtering. If you want it to be dynamic you will need to use JS to filter the cards as new filters are pressed. If you dont mind reloading the page you could do it all in hubl but to get the best user experience you would still likely want to have a “filter” button that would reload the page with a query parameter that would be passed to hubl when then page is reloaded."
