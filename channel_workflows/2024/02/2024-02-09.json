I am getting the following warning when I run a test: `Testing results include invalid JSON` .  The response from <http://webhook.site|webhook.site> looks like this:\n```statusCode: 200\ncontentType: application/json\nbody: \"{\"hs_execution_state\":\"SUCCESS\"}\"```\nThe webhook is going out fine, but I would really like to be able to parse the response. Any idea whats happening here? Even if I return a blank response I get the warning, I would like to be able to branch data in the body.",
