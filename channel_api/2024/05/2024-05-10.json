I have a question regarding the configuration of a *private app's* API key in HubSpot.\nIs it possible to restrict the *API key* generated from the private app to access only certain objects that belong to a specific team? For example, I want the API key to retrieve and modify deals that are associated with a particular HubSpot team, without access to deals belonging to other teams. Essentially, each team should have read/write access only to its own resources (deals, companies, contacts), without access to resources of other teams.\nI've reviewed the HubSpot documentation, but it seems that private apps can only manage endpoint access. However, I believe that this level of access control is possible within the HubSpot UI, so I'm curious if it can also be achieved through the API.\nThank you for your assistance.",

However, we prefer using an embedded form from WebinarGeek.\n\n- *Issue*: The WebinarGeek form lacks UTM tracking support. Consequently, our Meta ad conversion tracking through HubSpot isn't functioning correctly. All contacts are currently marked as Offline Sources due to the nature of the WebinarGeek integration with HubSpot.\n\n- *Objectives*: Maintain the use of the WebinarGeek form (or somehow leverage the API of HubSpot or WebinarGeek or both) while implementing a solution that:\n  1. Emulates the behavior of a native HubSpot form submission.\n  2. Restores functionality to the Meta ad tracking module in HubSpot.\n  3. Ensures conversions are not recorded as offline sources.\n\n- *Current Progress*:\n  - I have placed a HubSpot form alongside the WebinarGeek form and hid the form with CSS.\n  - Managed to store UTM values from the URL into the browser's local storage.\n\n- *Stuck Point*: Need help progressing beyond storing UTM values—looking to effectively use these values for tracking and store them alongside the WebinarGeek form submission in HubSpot.\n\n- *Request for Help*: I'm open to other ideas or approaches that might help achieve these objectives. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated!",
