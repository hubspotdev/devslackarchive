Since they're necessary for Repeater Options, and sometimes Display Conditions (since we can only use one operand and operator), it limits what we're able to do with modules and sometimes makes it impossible to accomplish something without an unintuitive workaround. Even just being able to go one or two levels further would make a huge difference although I'm mostly just curious why that limitation is even there.",
