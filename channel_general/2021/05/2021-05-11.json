    "text": "Hi guys, I have quite an odd bug. When I visit the page <https://www.caseware.nl/trainingen/consolideren> in an incognito or normal tab, the menu is all messed up. This is only happening on specific pages. Somehow, the mobile menu is rendered inside the desktop header. When I add the bust cache param to the URL, the page looks fine (<https://www.caseware.nl/trainingen/consolideren?hsCacheBuster=5608>). When we edit the page, it looks fine inside the editor as well. Updating the global menu or the page makes no difference. There seems to be a cached version of this page that is messing things up.\nDo you guys have an idea how I can resolve this?"

The strange thing now is that with companies I can do workflow triggers like “at least one associated custom object has property a with value b”. Unfortunately the same logic does not work with custom objects that are associated to a contact. Does anybody have a solution to this problem?"

    "text": "Hello - We added new app to tracks inventory for products within HubSpot.  Syncs with Shopify, BigCommerce and adds inventory data within in HubSpot.  It also integrates nicely with HS workflows and Reports and Deals. Use case - a company that has b2c operation with Shopify or BigCommerce but also has a sales team that uses HubSpot to create deals within HubSpot and needs instant inventory numbers.  When Deals are closed/won it adjusts the inventory and syncs back to your ecommerce store. Tracks the inventory at different stages of your deals. <https://app.HubSpot.com/ecosystem/6221463/marketplace/apps/marketing/ecommerce/inventory-panda-283231>"
