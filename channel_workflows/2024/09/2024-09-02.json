The action sends selected properties to a Lambda function, which then triggers a worker code that updates certain contact fields.\nThe workflow should remain blocked until it receives a response from the worker code, confirming that the contact fields have been updated. However, the action is marked as \"succeeded\" immediately after the Lambda function sends a response, which isn't the intended behavior.\nIs there a way to make the workflow wait for the worker code's response before it ends, rather than succeeding right after the Lambda function sends a response?",
