It all functions, but I notice that when I am using the workflow editor and type into the static text input field `textfield`, a remote call is being made to  re-obtain the available options for the `remoteOption` field. There are no dependencies between the fields. It just seems strange and unnecessary to have the system make these remote calls every single time I type a character into another input field.  *Is this normal behavior?* \n\n```      {\n        typeDefinition: {\n          name: 'remoteOption',\n          type: 'enumeration',\n          fieldType: 'select',\n          optionsUrl: `https://${host}/v1/action/options`\n        },\n        supportedValueTypes: 'STATIC_VALUE',\n        isRequired: true\n      },\n      {\n        typeDefinition: {\n          name: 'textfield',\n          type: 'string',\n          fieldType: 'text'\n        },\n        supportedValueTypes: 'STATIC_VALUE',\n        isRequired: true\n      }```",
