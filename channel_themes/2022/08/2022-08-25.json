    "text": "And advice for getting a global JS file to load before module JS? I’m trying to get my global JS file to be the first thing loaded, but it seems like I’ve tried every combination of async/defer/position: ‘head’/position: ‘footer’ for the JS file and their module `require_js` portions, but the module JS always logs first. I have the global JS file imported near the top of my base template’s `&lt;head&gt;`:\n```{{ require_js(get_asset_url('../../static/js/test.js'), { type: 'module' } )}}```",
