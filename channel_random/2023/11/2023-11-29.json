    "text": "I was directed here from HubSpot support. I’m setting up a new model in 6Sense that’s integrated with HubSpot. In order to gauge intent from our outreach, I’ll need to identify email templates and/or sequences that align with this model. I’m wondering if there’s meta-data for “email template title” or “sequence title” that I can pass over to 6sense to make this work. Does anyone know? (Sorry in advance if this is a stupid question, I’m not super knowledgable in this area)"
