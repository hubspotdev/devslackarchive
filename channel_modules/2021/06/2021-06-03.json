    "text": "Hey AJ, thanks for the response.\n\nI suppose the ideal generic solution would be to allow for more than 1 featured image to be included (and stored as an array) featured_image[0] would always be the main one used for social media (as it is now), but any others in the array would just be included when you query blog posts. That way in my module I can do something like:\n\n`{% for post in posts %}`\n`&lt;div class=\"slide\"&gt;`\n     `&lt;div class=\"bg\" style=\"background-image:url({{post.featured_image[0]}})\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`\n     `&lt;div class=\"bg-mobile\" style=\"background-image:url({{post.featured_image[1]}})\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`\n`&lt;/div&gt;`\n`{% endfor %}`\n\nI understand that would break the current syntax (by needing to include the index '[0]'), so possibly keep the 'featured_image' key as it is, but include any others in a separate field called like 'featured_image_alt' or something so it would look like this:\n\n`{% for post in posts %}`\n`&lt;div class=\"slide\"&gt;`\n`&lt;div class=\"bg\" style=\"background-image:url({{post.featured_image}})\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`\n`&lt;div class=\"bg-mobile\" style=\"background-image:url({{post.featured_image_alt[0]}})\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`\n`&lt;/div&gt;`\n`{% endfor %}`"
