    "text": "Hey Mark, apologies for delay seeing this. You're correct about the JS API behind our video changed over recent months, but this was out of necessity and there was not a way to ensure more advanced usages with interact with players like this were all preserved; sorry for any trouble this caused. We should get a docs page up explaining the Video 2.0 JS API as we control it now, and will be more cautious about breaking changes going forward. There is an easier API for triggering play / pause on a specific video.\n\nThe custom poster image use case here is an interesting one, do you have a URL where I can see this in action by chance?"
