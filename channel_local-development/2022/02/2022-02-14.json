So now I have access to my company account and my dev account.\nOn my local environnement, using the CLI I used `hs init` to generate my config file and credential. It opened the \"personnal key\" page on my company account, I used it to generate my config file.\nNext I *wanted to add my developper account in the config file*, I used `hs auth`, but *it always open the \"personnal key\" page for my company account*, even if I previously switched to my dev account. So I cannot generate my access key for my dev account.\nWhat I am missing?",
