    "text": "Just wanted to throw this in here since some of you might bump into the same issue:\n\nCode Action output properties are not always defined before the next action starts running, causing e.g. “Copy Property Value” actions to fail.\nYou can mitigate this by including a delay after the workflow action. This seems like an oversight, and something I would love for the workflow team to address.\n\nIdea <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Prevent-quot-Copy-to-Property-Value-quot-actions-from-copying/idi-p/941193#M172920|here>.",

The Custom Code Action should synchronously create those outputs to be used in later actions, even immediately after. Have you reached out to support yet? If we get a bug report we can look into your portal to investigate what’s going on.\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to DM me your account ID I’ll start digging around to see what may be going on"
