I received a list of errors in the Google Search Console. I found that the links that creates error are links with hstc_ and a lot of parameters at the end. As far as I understand those links are created when someone comes to our site from another site and both sites have the HubSpot tracking code installed. Then HubSpot treats our domain as external and add the parameters in order to keep track of the users.\n\nthe links with problems are generated with the pattern \"<http://www.domain.com|www.domain.com>\". If I check the list of the domains in the HubSpot settings, I see that the target domain is \"<http://domain.com|domain.com>\" (without www. ) and in the list of the additionnal domains there's only <http://domain.com|domain.com>, not the www version. Should I add the www version in this list or change the target domain? The site is external. There's only some landingpages in HubSpot"
