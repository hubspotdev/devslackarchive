I am unable to find any way to dynamically find 'today's date' which at least I could use to create a workaround.\n\n*Question*\nIs there any way to identify what day of the week it is in HubSpot so I can build a workflow, or do I need to build an APP to make that work?\n\nThanks for any insights you can provide!",
