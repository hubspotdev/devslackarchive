The case is that the client wants to have all the associated commercial activities. We have seen that this can be done, but it does NOT get us the reports of the commercial activities by custom object, has anyone encountered this challenge? Apparently HubSpot is limited in this matter and we are looking at the best way to obtain these reports, since it is very important for the client. Do you know any alternative? Anyone get this kind of info? Is there a way to do it with the API? workflow? Thanks in advance and happy Friday"
