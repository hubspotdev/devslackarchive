I am trying to use the Dotdigital API to sync historic opt-out data to HubSpot, and wondering if anyone had experience with this?\n\nI want to set up a sync so we capture any historic opt-outs, as we migrate contacts into HubSpot over time.\n\nI have already set up the API connection, but struggling to understand the criteria match between systems."
