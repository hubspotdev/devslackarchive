And in this email I want the email being personalized with data from the customer like the product he chooses, his email, etc. I guess I should first create the email with the hubl variable and then create an automatisation with the data needed. Can someone help me and tell me which variable I should use ? here is the product module concerned attached. Sorry if my english is not clear i'm from France and trying to be the clearest possible.",
