So you use Contact Lists to manage who can see a page.\n\nIn your case youâ€™d want 3 contact lists, one for admins, vendors and members. Depending on your real needs, if your Admins would be people who would have access to edit website pages inside of HubSpot, then you can possibly drop the need for the separate admin list.\n\nYou can then conditionally show information as well as allow access to specific pages based on list."
