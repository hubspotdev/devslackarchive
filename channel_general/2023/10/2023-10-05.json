Despite removing the script from our site header HTML and disconnecting the app integration, Cookiebot is somehow still active and is blocking the HubSpot scanner/cookie manager from doing its thing.\n\nHubSpot support referred me here, Cookiebot support is non-existent, and I'm left with a non-GDPR compliant website.\n\nAny suggestions for a solution here?",

I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of HS support on this though so I don't know how to check it on their end"
