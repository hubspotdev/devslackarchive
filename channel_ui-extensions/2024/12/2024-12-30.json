    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI’m encountering an issue while trying to add a UI extension (card) to my existing public app.\n\nPreviously, I hadn’t used a `public-app.json` file (I set up auth and webhooks via the UI). However, it seems that the file is necessary for defining extensions. I’ve since created a `public-app.json` file, but when trying to upload it, HubSpot attempts to create a new app instead of updating the existing one. In my `public-app.json`, I’m using my App ID as the `uid`.\n\nIs this approach correct? Or is there something I’m missing?",
