For example, do you create a form in HubSpot and have Zapier populate it with information from the external form submission, or do you only have Zapier create new contacts? I would like to create workflows like autoreply, assigning leads to reps, etc.",

Any ideas? Anyone else do a ms outlook update recently that somehow this happened??happy to send a Starbucks gift card for ideas!"
