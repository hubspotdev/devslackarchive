    "text": "The blog listings template currently allows drag-and-drop but unfortunately I don't believe the blog post template allows it yet (though I think it's in planning).\n\nYou can still add custom modules or custom fields to the blog post template itself, depending on what you're trying to do. Fields I've found to be handy as you can still access that data if you ever swap out the blog post, or to pull it into the blog listings.\n\nI wrote a post on using fields in blog posts that may or may not be helpful: <https://www.stephanieogaygarcia.com/HubSpot-website-development/adding-custom-fields-to-HubSpot-blog-posts>"
