For this, I need to create a custom quote template in the design manager, which will offer a higher-level editing interface allowing me to use an HTML to <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules|customize modules> and other elements of the quote template. I need help from someone who has coding/developers knowledge to do this, because by default you can not add an attachment to a quote. Thanks in advance!",

So I'm in the process of looking into doing that. Is it correct that I *have* to build a HubSpot app to do this? This is *only* to collect custom events from our own software, so I would want an app to be private. But it says \"private apps do not support extensions, *custom timeline events* or webhooks. If you plan on building an app using these features, you should create a public app instead.\" (emphasis mine). Does this mean a private app does not have access to `trackCustomBehavioralEvent`?"

Do you know of good tutorials on how to develop custom modules with HubL? I would specifically like a video where the code starts from the beginning and shows all the steps to finish creating that custom module. Thanks in advance to anybody who can guide me to such resources.",

We have seen that this can be done, but it does NOT get us the reports of the commercial activities by custom object, has anyone encountered this challenge? Apparently HubSpot is limited in this matter and we are looking at the best way to obtain these reports, since it is very important for the client. Do you know any alternative?
