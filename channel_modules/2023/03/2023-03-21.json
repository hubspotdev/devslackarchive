Tested again to confirm!\n\nNo firm answers on what’s wrong, but a few things to look at or consider:\n• Always good to confirm that you’re working out of a directory that’s been fully initialized with the CLI, and that you haven’t typed `hs fethc` or something — just in case.\n• Are you trying to fetch from an existing account which has the older version of the search module? If you’re trying to fetch from a newly-created dev environment, perhaps `--assetVersion=1` doesn’t work for accounts that _only_ have that version?\nIf you can’t seem to get it sorted out, let me know and I’ll download and package up copies for you."
