I am seeking feedback on the product and people who want to join the beta waitlist for the full webapp we are currently developing. You can try it out for free on the Skimli website.\n\nWe are using HubSpot as our CRM and are huge fans of this community. TY in advance to everyone who gives it a shot :pray:.\n\n*Feedback Requested:*\n:white_check_mark: How well did we predict the best moments from the source video?\n:arrow_forward: Was the video editor easy to use?\n:art: Does the website clearly explain who the product is for and what problems it solves?\n\n*Key features:*\n:robot_face: AI video editor summarizes videos in any language (not a GPT* based solution)\n:fire: Processes video faster than real-time (tested on videos up to 7 hours long)\n:moneybag: Free to try (no signup required, we never spam/sell your data)",
