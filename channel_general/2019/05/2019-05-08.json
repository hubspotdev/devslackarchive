From your concerns above, it sounds more like you want to make sure that a surge in general traffic isn't going to cause major site slowness issues. The reason I ask.... If you have a lot of custom JS that can be processor intensive, or a lot of AJAX calls to build out the page, etc, then the way to test it is very different. But if you are just using the typical HubSpot functionality (hubdb, widgets, etc), then a basic apache benchmark test will do great (it will tell you how many HTML requests per second the page can handle minus downloading the extra resources like images, etc)"

To do that, use a Mac or Linux and run \"ab -r -c 10 -n 30 <http://someurl/>\". That translates to \"keep going if i see errors, open up 10 concurrent bots and send a total of 30 requests to that url. Keep in mind that if you have 300 concurrent users, that's not the same thing as active concurrent requests. For example, if someone clicks on a page, then spends 60 seconds reading it, in the analytics world, that use is still active/concurrent. But in the load test world, the second i get a response for that page, i'm immediately making another request."
