    "text": "Hello! I'm a recovering software developer turned digital marketer, currently working at a BI software company called Pyramid Analytics. I've used HubSpot in some way/shape/form for the past 5 years. Currently using Marketing Hub (migrated from Marketo a few months ago). Possibly migrating our sales activities away from Salesforce, as well as service away from Zendesk (TBD on both of those).\n\nBeen learning lots, and looking forward to continuing that learning!"
