I have everything connected and I am really trying to figure out which is more accurate? I am guessing, if HubSpot doesn't get an email from the customer, It has no idea if the sale was associated with a connected PPC platform? Any help would be wonderful.",

Happy to help look at any specifics you’d be willing share as well. Thanks for the heads up <@U38EZFVFE>"
