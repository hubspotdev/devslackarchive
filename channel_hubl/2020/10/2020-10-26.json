But it does not for blog-type `content`. Granted, this is also not documented.\n\nIssue 1: For consistency, I would expect blog items to also have a `content.language` property reflecting (1) their own blog item variant language or (2) their blog group’s primary language in the absence of a defined (1).\n\nHowever, `group.language` *does* exist for blog post groups (blog). *This is not documented,* but I’m relying on it to create a multi-language blog module.\n\nIssue 2: document this, so devs know that it exists and that it is supported"
