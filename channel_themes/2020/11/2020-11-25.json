Can you please tell me what the best practice is?",

    "text": "That's not a valid source for the file and wont work.\n \nThe src field expects a URL and does not interpret HubL. So you are passing an invalid URL.\n\n\nIf you simply want a default for when nothing is selected code your module to use your default image if the user has not specified one.\n\nWhen images are used in module fields that generally means they are some form of content. In that instance it is better to store the image in the file manager so that content creators can easily replace the image later"
