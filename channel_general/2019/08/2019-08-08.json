We need to be able to add some code to the head of the meetings iframe (which is on our domain) but it seems system generated. Curious if anybody has any interesting work arounds or ideas. Thanks!"

If I convert it to a global module and edit the source code there (with personalisations), will it display properly across the the rest of the templates?"
