    "text": "Hi all\n\n```Workflow Ticket to Company Association.```\nWe are experiencing issues with the improper association of companies with tickets because our contacts are associated with more than one company. When tickets are created, HubSpot automatically associates other companies linked to those contacts.\n\nThese associations occur under different scenarios, either manually or automatically, via API or workflow. This issue arises because contacts are linked to more than one company. We've submitted tickets to HubSpot support but haven't found many solutions. One idea we've considered is activating a setting to prevent a ticket from being associated with more than one company. However, even with this setting, we can't be sure that the first association is always correct. Therefore, we've come up with an idea outlined in the flow below. Do you have any thoughts on how we might improve this, or do you believe this solution is the most suitable?\n\nAdditionally, we still face the issue of optimizing our API call quota as much as possible.",

New ticket is created\n2.) Find the Company with \"Registration #\"\n3.) Rebuild the Ticket to Company Association\n\nThis feels a bit more streamlined and should be easier to troubleshoot.\n\nYou can then audit your workflow on a monthly basis for \"Tickets\" where \"Count of Associated Companies\" is greater than 1 or where \"Count of Associated Companies is equal to 0."
