The standard HubSpot form embed code alone would not get you all the way there, you will need to do a fair amount of customization.\n\nThere are a few paths you can take, the easiest for re-creating this specific style of form would probably be to use radio buttons and checkboxes for the room fields and whatnot, and normal email and name fields for the contact fields.\n\nBuild the form html as you see fit and then use javascript to on submit of the form, submit the values via the forms submission API <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form_v3>\n\nI’m sure others here have some great solutions to, so please share them if you guys have done something similar."
