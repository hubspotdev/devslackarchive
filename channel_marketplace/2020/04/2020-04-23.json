We recently added the requirement (<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/resources/what-are-the-module-requirements-for-the-marketplace#design-requirements>) due to the update to the page editor from a list view to a card view. If you’re having trouble, we have detailed instructions here <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/building-blocks/modules/configuration#adding-an-icon>"
