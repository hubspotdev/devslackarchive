So they wanted me to look into if either of these alternatives are viable for pulling data into a HubSpot email.\n\n1. My company builds online courses and we want an email to go out monthly with the most recently published ones. We already have our own API that we are able to query to pull data on those courses. *Can a HubSpot email pull data from a third party API?*\n2. My team is also open to building out the data as an RSS feed.\nIf either option is available, what does it look like if a call to them ends with an error because our site is down? Does an email get sent by HubSpot with no data in it? Or does HubSpot keep trying until it retrieves data?",
