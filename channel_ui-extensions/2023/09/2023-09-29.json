    "text": "hey all, happy Friday! thanks for flagging this, and apologies for jumping in a little late. I’ve added the import snippet to the top of each of the three main sections, so you should now see that in the in-app docs as well as the ones on the public site.\n\nin terms of adding the snippet to the top of each code sample, I’d want to make sure that makes sense across the board before starting on that work. it begs the broader question of: what’s the most useful code we can include for each component? if we’re going to update each of these code samples, I’d love to have a better understanding how how folks are currently using them and/or what the ideal might be.\n\nfor example, is it helpful that we currently surround the component code with the other function code? or would it be more helpful for copy/paste to just be showing the component itself?\n\ne.g. this for each component\n```const Extension = () =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;CrmDataHighlight\n      properties={[\n        'createdate',\n        'lifecyclestage',\n        'hs_num_open_deals',\n        'hs_num_child_companies',\n      ]}\n    /&gt;\n  );\n};```\nvs. this\n``` &lt;CrmDataHighlight\n   properties={[\n    'createdate',\n    'lifecyclestage',\n    'hs_num_open_deals',\n    'hs_num_child_companies',\n    ]}\n   /&gt;\n  );\n};```\nanyway, just thinking out loud as the early afternoon coffee kicks in :smile:"
