    "text": "Hi! The official docs say that there's a 10 second limit for your functions (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/serverless-functions#know-your-limits>), but the `hs`-client says it's just `3000ms` and that seems to be true when I'm not running the functions on localhost. Is there a way to increase this limit to the actual 10 seconds or are the docs outdated?",
