We need to connect HubSpot with another database that provides a SOAP API in a way, that you fill in the first three letters in a HUbSpot form field and it looks up all results and shows them in a pull down to choose from. Especially this is needed for the company name and the industry name form field. If you like to help us with that job, I can provide documentation. Thanks and happy holidays to all of you.",
