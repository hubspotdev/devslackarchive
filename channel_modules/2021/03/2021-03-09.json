    "text": "Hello All,  I made a repeater module that is used for leadership on a company page.  It displays cards with an animation that reveals name and position but wanted to add functionality that displays a bio when clicked.  I added some Javascript that makes a popup and dims the page but have been stuck on how to get the info on a specific card to display in the popup.   Does anyone know how to reference a specific instance of a repeater item when clicked?  Is there a different way of solving this problem?  Thanks,"
