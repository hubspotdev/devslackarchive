    "text": "Hi All, how do i use alias mapping to map content from one field repeater to the other, my current format looks as follows\n• Cards (cards) [repeater]\n    ◦ Card Link (card_link)\n    ◦ Heading (heading)\n    ◦ Paragraph (paragraph)\nand my new format looks as followed\n• Content (content) [Group]\n    ◦ Cards (cards) [repeater]\n        ▪︎ Card Link (card_link)\n        ▪︎ Heading (heading)\n        ▪︎ Paragraph (paragraph)\nBasically i just need to map the already filled content from the original repeater to the grouped repeater. i thought it was as simple as placing the following in my new cards repeater (as it was this simple with non-repeating fields)\n```\"aliases_mapping\": {\n            \"property_aliases_paths\": {\n                \"cards\": [\"cards\"]\n            }\n          }```\nbut this leaves my card repeater empty so far. please advise :pray:"

As a result the main value of using Wildjar &amp; HubSpot together (attribute revenue to measure and report on the success of all ads) is not being realised. I came across <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Inbound-Calls-Attribution-Tracking/idi-p/962306|this great post> on the community which confirms that this is how the current implementation works and that they were not able to find good workarounds. Curious if anyone else in the community solved this problem before or found a working alternative to Wildjar.",
