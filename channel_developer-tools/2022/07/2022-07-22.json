    "text": "Good afternoon! I have a question about HubSpot integration with PostgreSQL. I currently have an AWS RDS Postgres database and I trying to sync the data between the two. I used WorkFlow as a test but there is only the library that supports MySQL. I also see quite a few 3rd party integrations but wanting to know which you would recommend if I had to go that route. I would prefer to use the WorkFlows with Postgres instead of MySQL. Any help here would be greatly appreciated! :slightly_smiling_face:"
