Apologies for the confusion. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/ui-extension-components#panel|Here is an example> of the Panel structure that might be clear.\n\nFor the import errors, you can try removing your node_modules folder and your package-lock.json. After that, you can re-install everything and try again. <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C05R599UA12/p1705675003757829?thread_ts=1705587902.306279&amp;cid=C05R599UA12|Here is a thread> that can help you troubleshoot.
