    "text": ":rotating_light: *URGENT HELP NEEDED!* :rotating_light:\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI have a global partial that contains a header navigation module built in *React &amp; TypeScript*. A few months ago, I replaced the old header module across all templates with this new navigation in our *new theme*.\n\nSuddenly, the new header has stopped working *on some pages (without throwing any error)* of the website.\n\n:white_check_mark: *Works on:*\n• Homepage: <https://www.bannerflow.com/>\n:x: *Doesn’t work on:*\n• Blog Post: <https://www.bannerflow.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-personalization-at-scale>\n• Blog Overview: <https://www.bannerflow.com/blog>\n• <https://www.bannerflow.com/solution/case/scoot>\nWhat’s strange is that this issue appears *randomly*—sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Also, when previewing the pages where the header *doesn’t work*, it *shows up fine in Preview Mode and hsDebug Mode*.\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar issue before? Any insights would be greatly appreciated! :rocket: <@UAYBXDG4U> <@UCY83QS6Q>",
