    "text": "<@UQWGKUEN7> - Yes, unfortunately there is no language switcher on system pages! :slightly_smiling_face:\nUsing `request.referrer` is a very good idea! Depending on the setting there might be a URL parameter indicating the language instead of a slug. I am not sure if parameters are passed through `request.referrer`. But using slugs makes more sense anyway :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThank you very much for sharing your thoughts! :raised_hands:"

I have a question about the Video field: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/module-theme-fields#video>\n\nYou see I'm trying to set up a Schema data structure for our video posts, and one highly recommended property is the contentUrl or embedUrl. Is there any way to extract the content url from the Video File object?? Like this: <https://5638311.fs1.HubSpotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5638311/Videos/Demos/ACA%20Demo.mp4>"
