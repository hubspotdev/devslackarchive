    "text": "<@U02M054M5T6> Multiple things can be improved here:\n\n*Optional*: First, I see 11 forms in the frontend, not three. Maybe you have just three in the backend, but your popup modal load the forms multiple times, that mess up your DOM. Scripts and Stylesheets get multiple times embedded.\n\n*Optional*: The other thing is that your event listener in your code catch all events from all forms. Maybe that work in your case, but keep in mind that you can add a condition that check for the ID of the relevant form, that only the specific form will be triggered. Console.log the event object to get more information.\n\n*Necessary*: And please make sure you disabled the option \"_Pre-populate contact fields with known values_\" in the Marketing  &gt; Lead Capture &gt; Form &gt; Options. Or remove the value from the _lead_source_campaign_ fields manually with JavaScript after the forms get loaded."
