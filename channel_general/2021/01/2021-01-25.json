    "text": "Hi,\nwe're going to host our homepage on HubSpot cms under our company domain. In order to be gdpr compliant, we are required to have the user opt in before setting any (tracking-)cookies, is there such a consent tool built in? I have only found something like it under settings &gt; cookies, but it's only applicable when using HubSpot tracking on 3rd party pages, which is not what we're doing.\nAnd if there's no consent tool built in - where can I adjust the embed code of HubSpot javascript files in order to implement a 3rd party cookie consent tool like usercentrics?\nThank you",

I could not find an app for that"
