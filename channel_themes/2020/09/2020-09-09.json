I believe it is possible, but I can’t seem to find any documentation on syntax or anything. Basically, my custom module has a field group, non-repeating, and I am trying to set an image field inside of that field group when I pass the module into the {% dnd_module %} options. Is this possible? Does anyone have any experience with this?",
