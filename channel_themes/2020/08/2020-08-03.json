But if the client drags it to the content the section of course is not full width. Is there any way to pre set the section or something for a specific module so that when the marketer drags it it looks full width too?",

You use CSS to preset all of the section padding and margins but like you said that is across the board and not module specific.\n\nI have usually opted to set the consistent padding in theme settings for sections and then have content editors override that to 0 if they need a full width section instead of the other way around."
