Since we don’t have a JS way to make a graphql call from the browser (at least with auth?) you’ll have to do a full `window.location` page refresh to force the server-side graphql to be re-evaluated.\n\nUnless you go down the path calling an external service/serverless that makes an API call to HubSpot (from client-side JS).\n\nTo be honest our story about doing a server-side data fetch on the page load and subsequent client-side data fetches/updates (especially for the same data) needs improvement."
