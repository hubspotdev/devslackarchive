    "text": "<@U01D4JTE8R4> - Follow this:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/speed>\n\nIt lists everything I did, except the critical CSS.  I started from the boilerplate which already gets really good scores and then tweaked to fit the look I wanted then as I built I did everything in the guide.\n\nCritical CSS wasn’t a must for my site, but I wanted to reduce CLS further (this was an issue with my own templates and not the boilerplate) and have most of my CSS be loaded asynchronously.\n\nI made a critical-css.css file and did a HubL include, to include it into my base template within a `&lt;style&gt;` tag. Then in that file I included CSS for layout and some of the aesthetic stuff like background colors to reduce what changes between initial load and when the stylesheets kick in."

    "text": "Hi all. Has anyone noticed weird behavior when editing a drag and drop page if `button:before` is used in a theme’s css files?\nI placed the following code\n```button:before, .button:before {\n  transition: transform .3s ease-in-out, -webkit-transform .3s ease-in-out;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  content: \"\";\n  z-index: -1;\n  background: {{ button_bg_color }}; // this can be any color, doesn't have to be a variable\n}```\nin a theme’s `theme-overrides.css` file and it changes the HubSpot context menus. Is this correct behavior? Should my code affect the HubSpot CMS menus?",
