    "text": "Hi I am not sure how easy it would be get find some help on this via message, but I am happy to try out.\nI am aiming to have JS components being built and deployed on merge to master and I have added the following in my git yml file:\n```      - name: Build JS components\n        run: npx <@UDA553DRD>/cli@3.0.12 upload funnel-project funnel-project\n        shell: bash```\nThe git action for build completes successfully but HubSpot does not receive it so the autodeploy is not triggered.\n\nAlternatively I have also tried to connect the repo and the master branch to the projects settings in HubSpot, in that case a build gets triggered but fails after a few seconds with the following:\n```Commit details couldn't be fetched from GitHub. If this continues with your future commits, please reach out to HubSpot.```\nMy hsproject.json file look like this:\n```{\n  \"name\": \"funnel-project\",\n  \"srcDir\": \"./funnel-project\",\n  \"platformVersion\": \"2023.2\"\n}```\nSee screenshot for my project structure (I had to move to the root of my repo the `hsproject.json` because HubSpot did not find it when I linked the git repo)\n\nThank you:pray:",

Can that be ignored, leave only autodeploy flagged, and use git action only?"
