    "text": ":wave: hi <@U38EZFVFE>, thanks for the feedback!\n\nas you’ve seen, files uploaded to a file property from within the CRM are marked “hidden” (not searchable or publicly visible)\n\nwe’re investigating improved integration with the file manager, which would be a natural extension, but there are some tricky corner cases that still need to be figured out. from the product manager on the feature:\n\n> We understand the need for better integration between file properties and file manager. The reason for the new behavior is due to the customer need to ensure that any files uploaded to file properties that are protected by <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/properties/restrict-view-edit-access-for-properties|field-level permissions> and can only be accessed by users with permissions. Since HubSpot’s file manager does not have a separate concept of user permissions, we could not reasonably ensure that files uploaded from the file manager would only be viewable by users with the correct permissions. This is why files uploaded to CRM file properties are ‘private’."
