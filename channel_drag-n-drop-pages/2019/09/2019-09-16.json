However! I think what you’re probably interested in is the new drag and drop HubL syntax? If so, that’s accessible here:\n\n<https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-tags/dnd-areas>\n\nThat’ll be available to you now even if you’re not ungated for anything new.\n\nThere’s another beta signup that <@U6W3H6YN8> is running that, when it’s ready, will give you access to raw assets in the design manager, and access to the new global content editing experience. No definitely timeline on that yet, but we’re pretty close."
