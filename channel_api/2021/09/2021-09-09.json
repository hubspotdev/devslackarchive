I am looking for the data related to blog and landing-page stats, for instance:\n• Views\n• Sessions by source\n• CTA Views, Clicks and Rate\n• entrance/exits\n• Time on page\n• Bounce rate\netc.\n\nI'm seeing a table for form_submissions but I don't believe thats the whole picture. Any thoughts?",
