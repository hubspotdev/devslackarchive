    "text": "Hey guys, so i submitted a request to include the \"Design with Canva\" option inside HubDB as well. We have a lot of images on our site that come from HubDB and i'm sure a lot you must be doing the same. It'd improve the efficiency a lot if we could just design and save the images without leaving the HubDB interface. If you feel this \"feature\" is needed then please vote on the following link.\n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Use-Design-with-Canva-in-HubDB/idi-p/319661>"
