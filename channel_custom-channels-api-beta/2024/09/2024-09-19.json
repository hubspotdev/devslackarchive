    "text": "Hello everyone :wave: This is Samy from <https://app.HubSpot.com/ecosystem/19997099/marketplace/apps/whatsapp-HubSpot-integration|Rasayel>\n\nWe are experimenting with the new Custom Channels API. We created an app with scopes: `conversations.custom_channels.read` and `conversations.custom_channels.write` .\n\nThen created a test account for that app, but when trying to connect we get the following error:  \"Authorization failed because this account doesn't have access to the scopes required by the app. Please contact HubSpot support.\"\n\nWorth mentioned that the issue isn't with the OAuth flow itself as we already have it working but we just added these two scopes, for more info that's the App ID: 3534852, Test Account ID: 145175307\n\nDo you guys can assist us on this?",

I wonder if it has to do with some changes we made in making these scopes more broadly available as we shifted from private to public beta. I've forwarded on to my development team to investigate. No timeline yet but will keep you posted!"
