The idea was that the Lambda function then returned the pdf data back to the serverless function in its response, which then which in turn returned it to the browser.\n\nI have actually achieved the result I wanted  by the serverless function returning a 301 redirect with a signed url to the lambda function so the lambda function then returns the pdf data directly to the browser rather than via the original serverless function."
