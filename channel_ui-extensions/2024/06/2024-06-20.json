This may help with consistency of the row width and also increase readability. Does that help? Feel free to follow up with any feedback / use cases"

I've tried messing with some header and cell width parameters, but it looks like the table is in some UISection__ScrollWrapper that does not have width 100% set. Am I missing any parameter that I could use to do this?",
