You can catch them and they are being logged, but not everyone has the time to regularly check if something went wrong. We thought of sending ourselves an e-mail that included the logged error message / the function in which the error happened.\n\nThere is a \"send internal email notification\" block in the workflow, is there a way to make use of it in a repository / sdk?"

You need to type one letter, wait for it to search, then type the next letter. Very annoying for a search that already is a pain to use and typically returns far too many unrelated items.",
