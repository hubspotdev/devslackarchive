Where can I find a mobile solution? Can anyone help or point me in the right direction?"

I am not a full stack developer, but have learned enough to understand most API and JSON concepts  to get through most of the OAuth process. I’m currently transferring my HubSpot hapkey to OAuth 2.0. I’ve pulled everything into Visual Code Studio and created all key and client IDs within the dotenv file. I’ve been stuck for 3 days trying to understand how to configure redirect uri.\n\nWhen running yarn it takes me to the HubSpot OAuth 2.0 Quickstart App in my browser. No issues installing the app and selecting my HubSpot developer account which contains the app I created. When I chose the dev account I get ’Couldn’t complete the connection. The redirect_uri doesn’t match the client registered redirect_uri.”\n\nI’m not really sure how to configure the Install URL (OAuth) and Redirect URLs that are listed in the Auth tab in the developers app in HubSpot. Any help is greatly appreciated!",
