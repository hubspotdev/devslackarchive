    "text": "Hi everyone, I wanted to update the workflow I use to automatically validate emails with kickbox, but since twilighting from the O-Auth API to the private apps, I've been having trouble with getting it to work.  Here's a link to the code specifically that I use <https://gist.github.com/jackcoldrick90/cfdceb271cf14be70e441c6ee79849ef>.  In the place of where HAPIKEY is used, I have a secret linking to a private app, and then for KICKBOXAPI I created a secret that connects to our kickbox account's API, but I haven't had much luck with getting things to move through.  This leads me to think that the likely culprit could be our HAPIKey, as previously the Kickbox API would have been working the same. That being said, I'm not sure how I should go about and updating the HAPIKey so that this custom code works once again?",
