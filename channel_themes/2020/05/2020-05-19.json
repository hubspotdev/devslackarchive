Is there a slicker, perhaps more HubL-y way to handle this?:\n\n```{# AOS #}\n{{ require_js(\"<https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.js>\") }}\n...\n...\n{{ standard_footer_includes }}\n{% require_js %}\n  &lt;script&gt;\n    if(!AOS) { \n      ..load local copy\n    }\n  &lt;/script&gt;\n{% end_require_js %} ```"

If they update their logo while this theme is still in use, they won't be able to put it on their site without contacting my employer for support.\n\nA perusal of the documentation shows that image fields are supposedly only supported in modules now.  I'm more than a little miffed that a feature that had been functioning perfectly fine for a month after the launch of Themes got removed."
