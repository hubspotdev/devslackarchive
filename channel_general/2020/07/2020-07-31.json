This also blocks all _anonymized_ traffic. Does anyone know a better way to implement a cookie notice that follows the EU guidelines but is not limited to HubSpot cookies (like the HubSpot cookie notice)?",

I’ve already read the Oatuh flow and tested it with the example app but I want to do it with my company’s login page (similar to any other integration)\n\nI appreciate any guidance on this.. I feel a little lost sometimes."
