    "text": "I think the FTP is pretty nice for quick copy/paste of modules and files between portals.\n\nI compile js/css outside of HubSpot within my own dev environment and then use transmit to upload the compiled files into HubSpot using ftp.\n\nI dislike using the design tool html/css/js component packaging style of doing things because it simply lacks scss and switching over to building scss using hubl macros isss not what I’m going to do :smile:\n\nI’m not really complaining. Just explaining it out for you <@U7SL518D6> so you can gain understanding from my perspective.\n\nI havent had the time to get to know the localdevbeta yet but will do in the next initiation of my next project."

    "text": "Totally understand. i think once you try the CLI you'll find its a better experience than FTP.\n\nIt has a webpack plugin to make working with compiled files easier. You can also just set your files to `watch`.\n\nThe CLI also enables us to give better error messages, with FTP you can't always tell why an upload failed.\n\nThere's an ongoing beta for raw assets, enabling you to upload files like .scss files. We dont convert the .scss to css. But it enables you to store the files in the design manager. Making it easier to work with scss and tools like babel"
