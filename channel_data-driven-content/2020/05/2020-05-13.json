I would set the product title to be the page-title\nI would do the same for the URL path but obviously make it URL safe.\n\nAs for how you could get the data into the HubDB and do it in mass, one idea is export as CSV, use google sheets or excel to clone the values from product name to page title. Then for url you could use a function to convert the product title to URL safe.\n\nThere are a lot of ways you could do it, this is just one example that’s less technical"
