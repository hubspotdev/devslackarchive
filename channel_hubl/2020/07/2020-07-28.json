    "text": "Hello all, I have tried to find an issue similar to this but haven’t had luck on this particular issue:\n\nWe have a HubDB table and we are pulling data from that table to display on a landing page.\n\nSometimes, when we add items to the table, the page pulling the data is updating just fine. Other times, the page never updates with the new items. It isn’t automatically clearing the cache as far as I can tell. It’s not even a matter of waiting – the cache doesn’t update even after several hours or even a full day.\n\nany thoughts?",
