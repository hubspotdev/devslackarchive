    "text": "Hello all -- I have a client that I've worked with that is looking to hire a developer full time (as employee) for a few months. You would be working on custom modules in HubSpot, other HubSpot work, and would need to have the ability to help integrate APIs.\n\nI'd imagine this is serverless functions in the cloud, using node to connect the HubSpot site with other data points to provide data to the HubSpot site.\n\nThe client is a really awesome dude and I've loved working contract over the past year with them but I don't have the time to work on these things with my current workload. If you are interested, reach out and I can hook you up with some more details and an introduction",
