    "text": "Hello, I am struggling with styling my custom horizontal menu for a page template. I'm not sure whether to change the display property for the .custom-menu.primary class, and if so, to what, in order to get the ul menu items to stretch across the entire viewport horizontally. I've tried a bunch of different options (justify-items, etc) but nothing has worked. Any insight (including info about if the overarching HS styles are interfering with this) is helpful, thanks!"

I’m trying to copy a custom module to a portal in a test account, and getting an error that the account doesn’t have the required permissions for the asset. My permissions on the test account are superadmin, and I’m able to copy multiple other custom modules with dependencies and varying types of fields, but I keep getting the error on the particular one I’m trying to copy over, and I’m not sure how to pinpoint what the trouble asset is in that module. Has anyone experienced something like this?"
