    "text": "<@U7X5W7GAK>\nreally depends how the code snippets were implemented on the wordpress site, one way you could do it is before importing the blog find and replace say a wordpress shortcode that wraps the code with a div with a class. Then use a javascript library to make the code syntax highlighted and whatnot.  Another way is to use the |replace() filter on the blog content but that’s prone to more problems than going in and replacing the shortcodes.\n\nIf the code is not placed in the blog posts content but instead in some kind of widget area or part of the template, you could export that data and when importing it import it into a rich text field and have that rich text field be inside of a div with a class, then target that div with javascript and use whatever highlighting tool you want.\n\nAnother option if the code is all html, css, and JS, then I’d honestly recommend using codepen and embedding the code that way. It will make it more future proof and gives viewers more ability to play around and better understand the code. Paying for codepen pro(which is pretty cheap) allows further visual customization so the embed can look however they want to fit their site.",
