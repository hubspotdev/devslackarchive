    "text": "Hey Partners, I would love some advice on building a HubSpot API integration with a custom application for contact and deal management. We have started with a basic API call to create a deal based on a form submission on the application. The goal would be to have a 2 way sync between both systems, as a data element changes in one system, it would update the other. If a deal is updated in the system the application would be updated. We are currently sitting at about 150 custom properties in our application outside the standard contact &amp; company information and outside of the transactional data - e.g. timestamps. I would love to talk with someone who's got some experience in building a full integration before we get started. We're planning development to start in September.",
