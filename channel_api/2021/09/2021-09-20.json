The API call limits are associated with HubSpot APIs if you use and external source there are no limits on the HubSpot side"

Can someone fill in column C please on how to treat each event of status.  Options for each even/status are Valid/Invalid/Skip. Skip means the event/status cannot determine if email is valid or bounce. Thank you!",
