    "text": "I'm running into an issue where an email address stored in a contact property can't be modified using the `|split` filter.\n\nThe following code:\n\n```{% set email = \"<mailto:john@gmail.com|john@gmail.com>\" %}\n{% split = email|split(\"@\") %}\n{{ split }}```\nWill render this: `[john, <http://gmail.com|gmail.com>]`. A sequence with two items, everything before the `@` sign, and then everything after it. Likewise, if the email address is entered using a Text field in a Drag and Drop email like this:\n\n```{% set email = module.email_address %} // user enters '<mailto:john@gmail.com|john@gmail.com>'\n{% split = email|split(\"@\") %}\n{{ split }}```\nIt will again render `[john, <http://gmail.com|gmail.com>]` if the value of the field was <mailto:john@gmail.com|john@gmail.com>.\n\n:warning: However, if the value entered into the field is not a plain text email address, and is instead a property that contains an email address like `{{ contact.email }}`, then the value rendered is `[<mailto:john@gmail.com|john@gmail.com>]`. Which is a sequence containing just 1 item because the `|split(\"@\")` filter did not work on it. Similarly, neither `|replace` nor `|regex_replace` work either.",
