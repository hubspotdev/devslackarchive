    "text": "HubDB Dynamic Pages and GraphQL canonical URL issue.\nFollowing the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/use-graphql-data-in-your-website-pages?uuid=47eb821f-787a-4fb7-8fe3-737716150a02|documentation>, we’re able to set SEO things like featured image, page title, page description and canonical URL, for dynamic pages.\nHowever, the canonical field doesn’t output what we expect.\nOn a page with it active, the href value of  `&lt;link rel=\"canonical\"&gt;` is the same as the page we’re on - and not the unique value set in the HubDB column.\nHowever, the correct value shows in the HubSpot Analytics Code on the same page: `_hsq.push([\"setCanonicalUrl\", \"&lt; here &gt;\"]);`\n\nSo, HubSpot clearly knows about the canonical URL and injects it in the analytics code, but doesn’t include it as a `&lt;link&gt;`  which is ultimately the use case for it.\n\nHave any of you had the same issue, perhaps found a workaround?"
