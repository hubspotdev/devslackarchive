    "text": "Hi!\n\nI’m starting to build a new site for a customer on HubSpot, and been wondering what would be the best way currently available to have pre-production setup. We are going to have the themes and modules in version control, and I know that with eg. GitHub actions the changes can be deployed to the production site easily. I’ve also looked at content staging, but that looks like it does not suit when we wish to do local development to have version control. Then there are personal sandboxes to which it’s easy to deploy things in development, but that one then lacks the real content, settings, navigation and such to which the templates to be updated would apply to.\n\nIs there a way that would allow validating template updates etc. with live site data that would be managed from version control / local dev env? In ideal situation I would like to have eg. a staging branch in GitHub that would be deployed to customer staging environment in HubSpot when changes are merged, and then the changes could be validated with real site data before merging to master.\n\nThanks!",
