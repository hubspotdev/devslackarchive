Do you know if there is a way to do this in bulk? (for example; when I import a list of new contacts into HubSpot it automatically associates them with a company through the company domain name). I am a data scientist so i know somethings about code, but I have never worked with http posts/requests etc, that is why I am a bit lost. Hope you can help!",
