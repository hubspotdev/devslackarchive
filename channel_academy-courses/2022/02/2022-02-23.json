And the Preview of this Module shows as blank. \nI made a quick Screen Recording of the empty code and blank preview link: *<https://www.loom.com/share/17153d5281e64e1483a321c5984c7bb9>*\n\nI cannot find any resources to complete this task successfully. I'm grateful for any assistance! Thank you!",

It will create the fields in a file called `fields.json`\nonce you have set your fields, you will see an option at the top right called *Actions*.  Clicking into that, you will see an option to copy the snippet.  Click that and now you can go over to the html pane and paste that snippet in",
