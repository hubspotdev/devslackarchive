    "text": "I am wanting to connect Linkedin to HubSpot in order to use the Conversions API as documented here <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/ads/create-and-sync-ad-conversion-events-with-your-linkedin-ads-account>\n\nHowever, I'm also sending events via the pixel in Google Tag Manager. How would I deduplicate the same events coming from both sources? Could I send an eventId as a hidden field to HubSpot which then sends this on to Linkedin using the above integration and then also send the eventId with the same pixel event, after which Linkedin deduplicates? I know that's how it SHOULD work but I'm unsure if the native HubSpot-Linkedin integration would actually send the eventId to Linkedin allowing for this.",

    "text": "Hey all :wave: :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI am in need your help with a question related to _associations_ API.\n\nHow can I perform the following action:\n• search for `deals`\n    ◦ with associated `Companies`\n    ◦ that have association label 'lead-from-partner'\n• for those `deals`\n    ◦ set property 'source' to value 'lead_from_partner'\n    ◦ set property 'source level 2' to value 'installer'\n• for `primary contact` of those `deals`\n    ◦ set property 'source' to 'lead_from_installer'\n    ◦ set property 'source level 2' to 'installer'\nI have tried both from a workflow with code custom action, and by creating a private app. The problem with the private app was giving the correct scope access level.\nAny suggestions/input on how to perform the above?",
