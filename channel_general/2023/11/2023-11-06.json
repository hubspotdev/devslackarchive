I am building a customized landing page for a client that they are going to send via email to their customers.\n\nI am able to print the contact information such as Name, address, etc on the landing page by adding the email parameter to the url, for example:\n\n<http://example.com?email=john.doe@gmail.com|example.com?email=john.doe@gmail.com>\n\nThis way HubSpot CMS recognizes the email parameter and I can print on the page contact properties such as {{contact.first_name}} to print \"John\" in it.\n\nLovely feature to generate customized landing pages! &lt;3\n\nThe only issue I have is that our client is a little concerned about privacy and he wants another mechanism so people can't look for the personal information of other emails.\n\nIs there a way to use another identifier in the URL to detect the contact? Hashing the email address? Or something?",
