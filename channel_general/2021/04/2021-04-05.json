    "text": "Hi channel. Happy easter. How do you recommend to design a template? For example, if i have a slider module which needs a certain library, should i import this library outside or within this module? take into consideration that i'd like both my template and my custom module to be flexible for future pages. Thanks in advance for your feedback"

    "text": "Greetings all,\nI’m using <http://ASP.NET|ASP.NET> Web forms for my site, and am integrating with HubSpot. In my Site.Master file, I have the following code:\n`&lt;!-- Start of HubSpot Embed Code --&gt;`\n`&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" id=\"hs-script-loader\" async defer src=\"&lt;//js.hs-scripts.com/XXXXX.js&gt;\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`\n`&lt;!-- End of HubSpot Embed Code --&gt;`\n\nThere are several things that this does for us, including page tracking and a chatbot. However, it does one thing “for” us that we’d much rather do through the API: Contact creation. It automatically creates Contact records whenever new user data is entered. We would like to shut off this feature, but there is no documentation for what features are included in the scripts or how to interact with them.\n\nAny thoughts? Thanks!"
