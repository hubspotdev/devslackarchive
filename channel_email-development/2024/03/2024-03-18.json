Is there code that I could add to make it function properly? <https://www.loom.com/share/40e6bdf253794d0b9ee60fc1ac5b9dbf?sid=67f6eaff-deb8-4013-ab8f-d2e9ba05da72>",

But is the functionality that Melanie mentioned available to edit easily just using a HubSpot menu of some kind? Or is she going to need someone to write code to do this.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Melanie, my preferences page which I’ve only made minimal style changes to, functions exactly how you describe wanting it to. So my assumption is that everyone else should be working like that by default too. And so maybe yours was modified in a way to break that functionality, or there’s an option somewhere that someone checked or unchecked.\n\nUnsure!"
