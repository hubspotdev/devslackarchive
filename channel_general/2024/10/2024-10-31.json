You can send out a Newsletter thats directed to B2B customers or a newsletter directed to B2C Customers, but they are not itself a content type more a criteria."

Then use same-object association to associate them back to the parent deal. Child deals could go through the same sales process as the parent deal. When all child deals close you could mark the parent as closed.\n\nI suppose you could also create a status and/or date property on line items and do something similar."
