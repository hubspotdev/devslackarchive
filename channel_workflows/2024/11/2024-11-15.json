Any ideas or findings ?",

    "text": "Hi, I'm currently getting familiar with workflows and the deployment of custom actions through our public app. To do so, I created the example action \"Create Widget Example #2\" using a POST request to <https://api.hubapi.com/automation/v4/actions/{{appId}}>. This action <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/api/automation/custom-workflow-actions#example-%232|should be available for all workflow types>.\n\nHowever, this action is not being offered in the workflow editor in my test account connected to the app. In the action's definition, the `published` field is set to `false`. Is that why it isn't displayed in my test account? How can I test this action before publishing it?\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/api/automation/custom-workflow-actions#test-and-publish-your-custom-action|The docs say>: \"You can also test the action in your developer portal by creating a workflow in the workflows tool.\"\n\nIs the \"developer portal\" the homepage of my developer account? Where can I find the \"workflows tool\" in it?\n\nApologies if these questions seem trivial, but I'm feeling a bit stuck right now.",

    "text": "OK, I’ve now found two old threads from 2023 about exactly the same issue:\n• <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C019VT42R8X/p1695978625443689>\n• <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C019VT42R8X/p1693575184354839>\nThe frustration with the unclear or outdated documentation existed more than a year ago.\n\nSo, I assume the solution is still the same: Unpublished actions cannot be tested. To test an action, it must be published. To ensure that users of the app cannot see the unfinished action, you need a second app that is only connected to your own test accounts."
