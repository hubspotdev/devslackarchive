    "text": "Hello everyone! my question is related to webhooks. Has anyone used them but the other way around. So the app that I’m using (in this case livestorm) is sending the webhook, but I don’t know how should I retrieve that information. Should I create a workflow as well on HubSpot or should I do it on the backend with a serverless function?\n\nThe theory of it seems more simple than doing requests but confusing to implement. Thanks in advance :rocket:"

It shows references between actions (outputs from previous actions or CRM properties that are used as inputs to the action, or outputs from the action that are used by other actions). Out of curiosity, is there something that you’re hoping to add to that tab?"
