    "text": "Hey Dustin â€” What is likely happening is that there is no subscription form setup. It is created by default only if there is a subscription email setup for the blog (which does not happen by default). To double check you will want to go into blog settings&gt; subscriptions and then make sure at least one is toggled on. If not create one real quick and then the form should show up."
