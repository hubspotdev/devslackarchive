However, I want to be able to create nested comment responses from the api (same as if you were using HubSpot's website for viewing the blog posts).  However, I can't seem to figure out how to create nested comments through the api, or if it's even possible.\n\nI've tried passing the parentId (comment id of the comment being responded to).  I then tried passing the entire parent comment as the parent object in the request body but that doesn't seem to work either.  When you pass the parent object, its returned in the response of the comment that was created, however, when you refetch the comments, the parent to the new comment is actually null.  I've also tried passing both the parentId and the parent object but that didn't work either.\n\nDoes anyone know if it's possible to create nested comments/comments to comments for blog posts via the api? Or could anyone point me in the right direction/where to go from here?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!",
