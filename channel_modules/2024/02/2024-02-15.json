    "text": "Good morning, I have just been using HubSpot for a few months and I have a question about the blog comments module that maybe someone can solve for me. The thing is that in the website I am working on I have a section of blog /article and resources /resources. Both share the same template file where is added the blog comment module block that comes by default in HubSpot. The thing is that in /resources if the comment form appears and in no blog appears and I do not understand very well why.\nI hope someone can solve my question. Thank you very much!",
