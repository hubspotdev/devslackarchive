The repeater field’s “Object sorting label” I want to show both the first and last names.\n\nMy idea to solve this was - add a new field called “full name” with “prevent editing in content editors” enabled, and the default text set to {{module.team_member.first_name}} {{module.team_member.last_name}}\n\nAnd then the “object sorting label” would be set to my full name field instead."
