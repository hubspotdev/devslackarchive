However, we found that if a user sets up 2FA during their account setup and then navigates to Settings &gt; Your Preferences &gt; Security &gt; Remove Primary Method, it basically allows that user to bypass 2FA.\n\nOur concern is that this will be allowed up until some behavior happens (ex. they sign in without 2FA for the 20th and then it requires 2FA to be re-added).\nIs that a feature, bug, or a miss? Our preference would be that they do not have to re-add 2FA."
