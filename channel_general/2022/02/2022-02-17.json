Have a Name field that is a text field that has a default value and always shows in the preview.\n2. Have a e-mail address field that's a text field with a default value. \nFor #2, does HubSpot _not_ allow you to have e-mails as a text field and you have to use the actual e-mail field? I tried the URL field and it'll work for approximately half a second then dissapear from the page. Are you not allowed to expose e-mails?\n\nAs for #1, I can't get a default to show, and when I enter a name in it's returned as a Array. Like it's not even set to be a repeater field but I still have to do: {% inline_text field=\"staff_name\" value=\"{{ item.staff_name[0] }}\" to access it\n\nHoping for some direction on this, it seems like the Module Manager just doesn't keep up with itself or something? It also is picking up some weird phantom fields that I created and deleted but I can still access within the editor and shown in Preview.",
