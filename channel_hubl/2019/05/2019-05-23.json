I'm attempting to inject html content after a page event and needing to that content to include dynamic content from the page. I've seen it said that it CAN be done... but I seem to be missing something on how to actually make it happy. For the sake of an example here is this:\n\n```\n// this stuff lives in the JS portion of a custom module \n\n{% if dynamic_page_hubdb_row %}  // do I need to reference the dynamic nature of this here?\n  const name = {{dynamic_page_hubdb_row.asset_name}};\n  console.log(name);\n{% endif %}```\n\nAnybody have some insight on this?",
