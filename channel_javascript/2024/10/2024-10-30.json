    "text": "Hi Everyone!\nI have one problem with tracking contact's web activity before user is identified (using their email).\n\nI'm trying to track user's activity across two domains:\n\n• Users are starting on our main website <http://www.example.com|www.example.com> navigating through various pages.\n• They are then redirected to our subdomain <http://portal.example.com|portal.example.com>, which is SPA where they complete a form to provide their email.\n• When form is submitted I'm identyfing user with following javascript:\n```const _hsq = (window._hsq = window._hsq || []);\n_hsq.push(['identify', { email: contactEmail }]);\n_hsq.push(['setPath', '/path']);\n_hsq.push(['trackPageView']);```\nAfter this, I get new contact created in the CRM but without any website tracking activities, even without that last 'trackPageView' event.\n\nHas anyone had a similar problem? Or maybe have an idea what I'm missing.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "text": "<@U07S0CV1PT7> - did you get this figured out? Not super familiar with Electron other than it's a framework for making desktop apps. Am I correct in assuming that loading the 'index.html' file is something similar to a 'server side render'?\n\nDoes the 'view' that the app loads actually run HTML and JS when it loads in the clients environment? (like a web browser would). If so, the tracking code should be able to load like a normal `&lt;script&gt;` tag would. The tracking code loads a script loader which in turn loads a few other scripts (controlling chat and tracking). Those separate scripts need to be inserted into the DOM and run"
