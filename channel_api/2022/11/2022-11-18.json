The code below stopped to serve proper email data and is responding with some weird object.\nThis had happened for the second time in the last two weeks. Lastly HS support admitted that dev team was tempering with API.\nThis basically causes my signup demo forms not being redirected properly and loss of $$$ of company I work for. Was wondering if there is a way to prevent from that.\nWhat I have done before is a fallback if `email` variable was undefined then email value is taken straightaway from my signup form but in this last case it doesn't work as response is present but has another structure :confused:\nSo problem now is: response should serve email that user typed in ---&gt; it serves some other data like the response structure has changed\n```window.addEventListener('message', event =&gt; {\n   if(event.data.type === 'hsFormCallback' &amp;&amp; event.data.eventName === 'onFormSubmit') {\n      let email = event.data.data[0].value; // (or event.data.data.email should work as well)\n   }\n});```"
