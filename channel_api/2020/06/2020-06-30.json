It appears that any file uploaded via the “Upload File from your computer” link OR files attached to emails from the conversations inbox, have a property of `hidden: True` in the `/filemanager/api/v2/files/:file_id` endpoint.  I’ve seen a lot of forum chatter about these files not being “publicly accessible” but I find it hard to believe that with metadata attributes like `s3_url` and `cloud_key`  and `alt_key`  that there is no authenticated way to download a file.\n\nHas anyone had any luck with this?",
