    "text": "UPDATE: In case anyone is interested, HubSpot Support got back and said they don't support logging for endpoints right now, only when a serverless function is called via an extension card. Also the issue with the google sheets API was the node system doesn't work normally (you can't use external files as their file path is different?)... and since the Google Sheets API secrets file has secrets that are longer than HubSpot allows in their secrets (&gt;&gt;120 characters), I'll have to take this project to an external source (AWS) :disappointed:"
