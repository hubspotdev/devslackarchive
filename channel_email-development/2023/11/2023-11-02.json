As Gmail clips emails over this size, the calculation of your open rate metrics will be affected. If you want to reduce the size, you can preview your email here to see where it will be clipped._\nOk. Great. I _really_ doubt that, but I guess I have to stop and check that. So I cloned my email and then sent a full production send to just one recipient, myself. A few minute later it lands in my inbox at Gmail. No clipping found. I download the message and open it in <http://Parcel.io|Parcel.io>. Just 70kb. Wayyyy below the 102KB limit.\n\nSo it’s great to know that HubSpot’s clipping warning is wildly and completely unreliable.\n\n:man-facepalming:",
