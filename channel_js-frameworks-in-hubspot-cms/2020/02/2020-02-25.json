    "text": "Hey, thanks for the reply <@UBY1V5ARF>! Sorry for the delay, been OOO for a few days.  So there's not a bug per say, but the graphql seems as though it's limited to the same data you get with a single REST api request. I'm new to graphql, but in my experience thus far the big advantage to graphQL that I've seen is that you can make a single request to get data across multiple relational tables.  For instance, as I mentioned above I was only able to get the ID's of the tags of a post, whereas I believe I should be able to dig down into that tag data and get the name"
