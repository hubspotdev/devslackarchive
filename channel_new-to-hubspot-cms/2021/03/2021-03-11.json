I enabled the modules as Blog Page, but I still can’t see them on any of the blog pages I created whilst I’m on editor mode. I can see them however on Website Pages.\n\nHow can I enable modules to appear on Blog Pages?\n\nThank you very much!",

    "text": "Hi everyone! Working my through HubSpot academy. I'm working on the lesson for setting up the local development tooling, including setting up the test theme. As per the video instructions I ran npx @HubSpot/create-cms-project test-theme in the terminal. As expected, this created a test-theme folder, however the folder is empty. Based on the lesson video, it should contain a whole bunch of files lol. Has anyone run into this problem or know how to fix it? Thanks!"
