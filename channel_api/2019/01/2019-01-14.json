It sounds like the _response_ from VidYard is ultimately what you need to parse in order to retrieve the `UUDI`, which you would then pass back into the contact record via the `customID` contact property.\nWith HubSpot webhooks in workflows, a JSON body of data for the object in the workflow (i.e. contact, deal, ticket, etc.) is sent to the specified URL. The response data for that webhook (i.e. the data from VidYard in this case) is not retrievable inside HubSpot. If I'm understanding you correctly, the way I see this working would involve a middle-tier application:\n1. HubSpot webhook sent to middle app.\n2. Relevant data is parsed by middle app, which then sends a webhook to the VidYard app.\n3. Middle app parses response from VidYard app to get the `UUDI`, then makes API call to update contact in HubSpot with the `customID` value.\n4. HubSpot automation takes care of the rest to send contact the email with a dynamic VidYard URL.\nDoes that sound like what you're looking for?"
