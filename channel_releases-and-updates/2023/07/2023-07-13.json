    "text": "So there's the new release on quotes I see:\n\nNow, one-time discounts, fees, or taxes will only apply to \"at payment\" line items. Note: if you choose Stripe as your payment method, all line items will be treated as \"at payment.\" <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/quotes/use-quotes|Learn more.>\n\nThis is a problem for some clients as they might have a one-time discount for say year 1 or a future dated line item for say \"Onboarding\".  What are others looking at for this?"
