    "text": "Hello everyone! When trying to deploy our react project and theme for the first time we're getting an error because it can't find any module or partial. We're using typescript, when testing it with \"jsx\" files it works well, so it has to do with the way we're using typescript here. Has anyone ran into this issue before? Thanks :pray::pray:",
