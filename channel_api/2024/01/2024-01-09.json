I'd like to ask you about the update of the issue. <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/External-Options-from-API/m-p/784158> The problem is that we can't retrieve options for the fields that are marked as external options. We are using the app and have an API HubSpot integration, but some enum fields are empty. Could we overcome the problem somehow right now?",

As this is not supported by the webhook subscription (from what we can read on the documentation), we are stuck. It looks like we can register one target URL via the HubSpot user interface, but the target URL is generated by Microsoft PowerAuomate autonomously and it's not visible.
