The main one I think being that developers were creating a ton of redundant code for example building most of a site in a hubl or html modules instead of using custom modules. so if you have 10 templates, you’re stating the same thing 10 times. Also the more we use custom modules for things the better the marketplace will be as people will start selling their modules"
