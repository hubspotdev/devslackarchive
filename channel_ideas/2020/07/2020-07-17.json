    "text": "How about the ability to add custom pass-through/proxied pages on a HubSpot site? Allowing an oAuth application to add routes to a site could be quite useful for extending functionality (like adding a edit profile section for user profiles)\n\nWhen the application is installed, it could register routes like:\n\n/dynamic/{page_x} -&gt; <http://myexternalserver.com/HubSpot/{page_x}|myexternalserver.com/HubSpot/{page_x}>\n\nHubSpot could then pass through some contextual information (such as user tokens in the header) which the externally hosted application could use to do some more advanced server-side logic. It could then return HTML or even HUBL which could be passed through HSâ€™s servers and then returned to the user.\n\nNaturally, there are potential performance implications - but adding a timeout could suffice.",
