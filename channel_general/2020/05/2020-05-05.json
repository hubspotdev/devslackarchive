I am having an issue with a property, and it had worked prior but now its not, so I'm hoping for opinions on what it could be or assistance with a workaround. the problem currently is I created a contact property {{ contact.myview }} in the contact profile this is set as a single line text with a specific domain. on the cms side, i have a button with {{ contact.myview }} as the link. it worked for a while now it is not. and I have no clue why, the only variable ist we upgraded to enterprise last week.",
