    "text": "Hi, team, I hope this finds you well. I’m currently onboarding a customer who’s in the Custom Quote Template beta.\n\nThis feature is critical for their implementation, and they have allocated several hours of their internal devs to create and test the templates. But they have not found a way to pull in data from contacts, companies and deals into the quote that is being created.\n\nI’ve done a lot of research on this, but I don’t have the dev skills to guide them to a solution myself. Is there anyway you can help us solve this?\n\nCustomer: <https://tools.hubteam.com/hub-details/9436772/activity>\n\nContext: developers do not know what to use instead of “import mock data” and “import sample data” in order to find the location of the records they’re trying to pull in (see lines 8-10 in the screenshot).",
