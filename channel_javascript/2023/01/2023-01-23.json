    "text": "alright, I am using the `sdk.client.crm.contacts.associationsApi.create` call. based on the sdk, it appears to be using the v4 API `create(contactId: number, toObjectType: string, toObjectId: number, associationSpec: Array&lt;AssociationSpec&gt;, _options?: Configuration): Promise&lt;LabelsBetweenObjectPair&gt;;` . v4 is the one where the `associationSpec`  comes into play.  I have is setup like below, but it's erroring. When I check the logs for my Private App, it is using the `v3` endpoint, not `v4` . anyone else encounter this?\n```await this.sdk.client.crm.contacts.associationsApi\n        .create(contact.HubSpot_record_id, 'companies', associatedCompanyId, [\n          {\n            associationCategory: 'HubSpot_DEFINED',\n            associationTypeId: 1\n          }\n        ])```\nthoughts?",
