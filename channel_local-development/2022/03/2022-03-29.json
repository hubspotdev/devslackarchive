    "text": "Correct, to put it in WP terms <@U038JB86KAT>, while a theme is still a theme, there is no equivalent to backing up “files + database” on HubSpot. The page objects must be built within HubSpot itself and can not be moved natively from environment to environment (though there are some options available using the CMS API endpoints).\n\nRather than building in a dedicated staging environment, I have the best experience using HubSpot’s built-in <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/website-pages/redesign-and-relaunch-your-site-with-content-staging|content staging> tool, where you can stage a copy of a published page, swap out the template/theme, and safely develop and test your new code without affection production."
