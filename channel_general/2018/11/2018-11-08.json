See, you do not need to upload webp images, because they convert all of your images to webp automatically, and serve that version to users if their browsers support it. The way they are doing it the file name is shown as .jpg or .png but the file will actually be a webp image with that file name instead. They’re doing it all server side. It’s bloody magic"
