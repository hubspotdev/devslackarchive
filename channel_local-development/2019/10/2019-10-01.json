Please contact the integrator.”\n\nwhen I change the redirect URI, it automatically changes the OAuth URI so i see that as a match. i have “Content” scope selected, and i’ve also tried it with no scopes selected.\n\nbut the URI the authenticator is going to seems to want to redirect to localhost:3000.  i’ve tried that, and other local URIs. what am i missing. i’m not seeing this covered very well in any documentation.",
