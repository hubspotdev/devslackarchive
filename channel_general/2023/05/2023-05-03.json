The quiz works great but when looking at the page performance Google shows duplicate  javascript file bundles loading on the page. So each form or scheduler embed is the issue. I’ve try to set this up several different ways but I still have not found a solution so I don’t have the same js file loading multiple times. I’m not sure why HubSpot is loading it’s own files in multiple times. I’ve loaded multiple forms on a page before and have not had this issue. And I can’t find any documentation on it or find anything in the HubSpot community website about this issue.\n\nDoes anyone know a solution?"
