    "text": "&gt; HubSpot’s serverless functions are intended to be used to add functionality to your HubSpot site, such as supporting advanced form submissions and pulling in data from other APIs. It’s not intended as a generic computing platform where you would run code unrelated to HubSpot.\nYup, that’s exactly what I’m using it for. Well, it is “code unrelated to HubSpot” in a sense, but this is exactly what serverless functions is for. I’m making an API route that will generate a PDF based on query params, and it will download for the user after they submit a form. I’m doing it this way so it doesn’t have to be saved on the server, and so we can link to the PDF results dynamically in emails as well.\n\n&gt; I’m not sure what you’re buffering a response for, but what I can tell you is that there are restrictions. You’re likely hitting one of them. My guess, memory, content type, or payload is causing your errors. If that’s not it, timeouts.\nI’m returning a buffer response to return a PDF. It’s possible I’m hitting one of those I guess, although it’s a very simple buffer I’m testing with and shouldn’t be causing issues. It works completely fine on localhost using `hs functions server` , but that’s when using my own package.json to declare dependencies; I can’t run deploy though because I’m not in the packages beta, so I’m using esbuild to compile it first."

    "text": "Hi all, I have a question regarding accessing an external API within a CRM Extension. I’m not sure this is the correct channel?\nI need to generate a JWT token in order to authenticate my calls to the external application. However, in order to generate the token, I need a specific library (using jsrsasign from <http://jwt.io|jwt.io>). So I have two questions:\n• is there a standard way to authenticate to an external API using JWT (so I don’t have to reinvent the wheel)\n• if not, how do I import an external library in a serverless function environment)?",
