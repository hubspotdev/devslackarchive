The theme has global partials to set up headers and footers. There's an issue where the header gets shared across each domain but I need each domain to get a different one.\n\nDoes anyone know if this is possible, to have different global modules / partials for each domain?\n\nThanks for your help!\nDavid",

Do you know if this is correct?\n\nThanks!"
