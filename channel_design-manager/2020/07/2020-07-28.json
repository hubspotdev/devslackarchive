Originally I updated the boilerplate css span6 targets to 50% width and removed the left margin.  <@ULHEDPDJ5> was nervous that this might effect other areas of the site, so we reverted these changes.    Currently to get the two columns full width, and remove the padding I'm overriding the CSS in the additional settings of each page."
