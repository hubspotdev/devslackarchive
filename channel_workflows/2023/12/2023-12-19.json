I'd like to now update that same action with some new fields. Unfortunately, the fields should be required. When I try to update the workflow action using `PATCH /automation/v4/actions/{appId}/{definitionId}`, I get back a 400 saying for example:\n```...\n\"subCategory\": \"ActionDefinitionValidationError.BACKWARDS_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE_NEW_REQUIRED_FIELD\",\n\"message\": \"Can't add required field `foo` as this would break existing actions. Please make a new action or make the new field optional.\",\n...```\nWhat is the correct way to go about updating such an action while maintaining backward compatibility? Is the correct process to simply create a new action with new input fields and delete the old one?\n\nThanks in advance",
