This has been operating just fine for months now. We ID'd a new piece of data we need in HS so I created the property and provided to the data ops team to send over as part of the regularly scheduled programming.\n\nHere's the issue, only the new property isn't getting written. All the other properties we're sending to HS continue to get updated, but just this new property is not being populated from the API call. And I'm not seeing any errors on this\n\nIs there a limit to the number of properties can be updated on a contact in a batch? I'm open to any ideas as to what the issue could be. I've asked the data ops team for example body and can provide that as soon as I get it, but kind of at a loss at the moment."
