There's a community post about this that I tagged the Associate Product Manager there to hopefully get some insight from."

Context, we don’t have Operations Hub and your post mentioned _“If you do not have Operation Hub Pro, you could still use this API through another platform that your developers could configure.”_\n\n&gt; I’ve seen the Beta documentation. From his explanation, I don’t understand how we’re able to do this without Operations Hub since that’s the only way to use a Custom code action in a workflow."
