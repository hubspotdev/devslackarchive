    "text": "actually i did get to find an issue - we are going to find the best way to fix this on our end. but for immediate solution - please pass on a UUID as the `integrationThreadId`, the docs say its optional but we might have to re-visit that. when you pass a UUID as an integrationThreadId when you send the first message, it will create a thread and return a `threadId` currently like it does currently - that is the `threadId` in the HubSpot system and not the `integrationThreadId` - and for any subsequent messages you can use the same UUID as `integrationThreadId` to make sure all messages are published to the same thread.\n\ni will update the thread once we fix it on our end. thanks for flagging."

    "text": "Dear <@U07L87JHRHB>,\nYour intuition was absolutely correct—it was an authorization issue. I was trying to publish the message using the token of a private app installed in the same portal ID, and since it had the `conversations.custom_channels.write` permission, I thought it should work.\nThank you so much for your invaluable help—I truly appreciate it! :blush:"
