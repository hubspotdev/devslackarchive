    "text": "So I've made some templates for emails using HTML + HubL that come with Drag and Drop zones and modules pre-configured. They're basically placeholders for non-technical staff to modify, move, replace, etc as they see fit, though we want to try and frontload as much of the design work as possible. One thing that's a little irritating is that I noticed when you're making emails in the \"Email\" section of the dashboard, there's a \"Style\" tab where some padding is applied to the modules by default. Is there a way to make that disabled by default in the template? I didn't see anything in the documentation that would let me.",
