We'd like to integrate the API in order to have the call recordings, but we'd like to have the 2 separate audio tracks and not 1 MP3 file that integrates the 2. We've understood that we have to split the audio file ourselves, but we don't know exactly how to automaticaly associate each audio channel to a person. Thanks",

(during this step, how does the application know which audio data to separate/mute out for each voice?)\n\nI am thinking a reference for each voice needs to be created prior to the process that splits the audio, so that you could have each channel linked to the reference that was created, associating it to the correct person..."

I am not sure if there any API which only list the parent entity only and not other language variation if there is a filter to get blogs without variation then it would be great"
