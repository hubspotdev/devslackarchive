    "text": "fetch is creating a secondary directory for me.\n\nin the directory lubrizol_lfp, I have a directory `design_mgr` and `HubSpot_config.yml`.  (we work on tons of things at once, thus fetching the entire design manager)\n\nI cd into lubrizol_lfp and run `npx hs fetch / design_mgr`. this has always worked just fine in the past, fetching the DM tree into the directory.\n\nsince upgrading yesterday, it overwrites changed files and skips matching files as usual, but also fetches the HubSpot DM root DIRECTORY into  `design_mgr` — so now I have a second copy of files at `lubrizol-lfp/design_mgr/design_mgr`.\n\nthis became a problem when watch wrote that second directory into HubSpot, and a colleague started searching for templates and unknowingly used the duplicates from the second directory, which I later found and deleted, leaving her stuff without templates.\n\n<@U6W3H6YN8> Possible to fix? or is there a flag I can put in to stop creating the recursive directory?",
