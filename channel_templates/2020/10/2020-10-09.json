    "text": "I’m stumped at what’s going on. I have a module with a boolean field that shows or hides content in . The module preview works as expected, and previewing the landing page with the Preview button shows the proper behavior. However, when I make a change with the form fields on the left, the Preview on the right doesn’t always update. Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn’t. Is there a click event that I could listen for to trigger a reload of the Preview panel on the right?"

    "text": "Hi guys, I'm brand new to everything HubSpot and I'm not even sure if this is the proper channel to ask this but I'm wondering how I can modify the \"template\" of a blog post and by template I don't mean the view that renders a post but more the model of a post, the data.\nFor my project we have a Blog property that should contain the estimate in read time for said blog post, now that information should be displayed in the listing template as well as in the blog detail view. HubSpot does the same in their own blog (see <http://blog.HubSpot.com|blog.HubSpot.com>) and I was wondering how I can replicate that since it can't be part of a module right? Since I also need to access that data in the listing template. Any help or even pointers to guides/turorials are welcome, thank you!"
