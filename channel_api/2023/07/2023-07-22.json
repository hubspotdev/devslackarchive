    "text": "Hi guys, please let me know if this is the wrong channel to ask this question. I have an app I use to communicate with a specific client's HubSpot account. I use it to update deals, so it requires certain scope permissions. Now I need to update these permissions to include contacts, but according to my app's settings, the app has no permissions at all. This is weird because if this was the case, I wouldn't be able to communicate with my client's HubSpot data at all, but I update their deals on a daily basis. The problem is that I need to know which permissions my app is currently using (I set the permissions a long time ago) so I don't accidentally remove any required permission, which would break my existing code. Is there a way to know which permissions my app actually has?",
