    "text": "Would be really great if we have control on the html output of default blocks, not only the content blocks also for rows, columns, header, body, footer wrappers etc. This way we could choose if it's interesting use bootstrap or make our own local blocks for each project and for example start to using CSS grid. I know we can 'hack' it and make it work. But if we could have more control in the html marktup we could clean the html output and improve it :)\nSo in summary, have the wrappers (column, rows etc) as an editable block will provide us perfect control to improve without limitations and keep working with the visual editor :)"
