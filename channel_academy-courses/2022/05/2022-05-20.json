    "text": "HI Matteo, I'm a fan of this <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/key-concepts|CMS Overview> page. It includes sections on how Themes, Templates, and Modules fit together, and also a section on HubL. Here also is a link to the main <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/key-concepts|HubL> page in the docs.\n\nBesides the docs, the CMS for Developers course you're taking is probably your best bet. <https://academy.HubSpot.com/courses/cms-best-practices-for-developers|CMS Best Practices for Developers> is also a recent course that launched that might be helpful.\n\nIf you're just looking for some code examples, the <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/tree/main/src|HubSpot CMS Boilerplate Theme> is a great starting point.\n\nLet me know if this is helpful.. happy to provide some additional resources if you need them."
