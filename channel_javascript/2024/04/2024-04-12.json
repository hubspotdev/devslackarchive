    "text": "Basically I’m trying to create some function that allows marketers to make page level changes to forms without needing to create a new form for every little thing. Right now we have 300+ forms and it’s too hard to manage. I’d like to have 1 form for each campaign type (ie: webinar, IRL event, demo, etc) instead of them creating a unique form each time. The problem is that sometimes they need different fields on that form like “choose your t-shirt size” etc. My idea was to pre-populate a hidden field on the page that captured the url that form was on and then create a dependent field visibility rule for that url value. This was pretty easy to do in marketo and we used that “last_form_fill_url” field for everything. I’d like to be able to give marketers the ability to set page level form rules without needing to know any kind of JS."
