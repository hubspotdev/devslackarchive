Instead it is automatically picking up the name of an existing quote and using that template and showing the Buyer step. This is not happening on all deals, only one in particular. Any ideas??

However, when I transfer the theme settings to the `field.json` file, an error occurs related to the 'fontid'. Without the 'fontid', the custom font doesn't function properly. Any help would be appreciated!",
