    "text": "I have an app set up to sync changes from HubSpot to a third party, and from the third party to HubSpot. When data is changed on HS a webhook is sent to the third party. The third party also sends webhooks when there is a change on that side. When a change goes from third party to HubSpot via the HubSpot API, that change is sent back from HubSpot via webhook. Anyone know which datapoints in the HS webhook payload I can check against to prevent duplicate syncing? Thanks!"
