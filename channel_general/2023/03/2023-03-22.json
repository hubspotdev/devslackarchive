The problem is if they are placed next to each other (in this case on the front-page hero) they overlap with each other instead of wrapping in tablet view, before actually wrapping on mobile. Is there anything I can do to fix this so the CTAs don't overlap? I would rather not have to change the media queries for the whole theme."
