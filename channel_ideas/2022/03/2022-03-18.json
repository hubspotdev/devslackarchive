Fair enough.\n\nBut what about when _*customer*_ changes their mind and wants to re-subscribe?\n\nIt’s not a bug, it’s missing feature then!\n\nBasically, we want to allow customer to control their subscription preferences via _our_ app (integrated with HubSpot via API). There is no way to achieve that if your API prevents controlling. How customer can re-subscribe without using e-mail (imagine that they already deleted all marketing e-mails)?"
