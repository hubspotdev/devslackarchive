    "text": "Hi <@U02BDDLB35F>! If you working with design tools, you can copy the template/modules by right click on the folder and select copy to different account. In case of assets if they are in the design tools its also possible, if they are in the filemanager the only way you can transfer them via cli. Pages can´t be moved between accounts.\n\nHere is a documentation for the cli part:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/local-development-cli>"
