I have a sticky header on the webpage, and I've also tried applying JavaScript for the sticky header.\n\nHere’s the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#test-ab\" class=\"btn btn-blue mb-0 btn-xl\">CTA</a>\n\n<section id=\"test-ab\">\n```\n\nMy header has a total height of 114px, with 40px hidden during scroll and the remaining 74px staying sticky.",
