That is why some of us are really interested in a community sourced (non hs related) event would be a really great thing for everyone.\n\nI have some more information in my linked in post that I made after talking with some developers at Inbound and I also have a sign up place where I can start seeing who would like to be involved. Please read the linkedin post and then fill out the form if you are interested in helping or just attending, even if it is virtual!
