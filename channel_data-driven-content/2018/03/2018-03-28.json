I have a project I’m currently building that required server side filtering and multiple hubdbs, I probably query the database up to 4 times under the right circumstances. I could see someone building a similar or more complex system might have to do more.I feel like if you hit 10 it’s reasonable to say you probably have some ways you could optimize how you’re doing things.\n\nOr quite frankly maybe hubDB isn’t the right solution to the problem you have at that point."
