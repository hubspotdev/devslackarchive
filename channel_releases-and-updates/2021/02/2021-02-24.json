I’m afraid I don’t have an answer for you at this time.\n\nTheoretically though the markdown file should be accessible via a dynamically generated URL like a .js file would be. The main use-case for markdown files in your project is really to provide notes like “We’ve locked this folder because everything in it is fed by a GitHub repository."

GitHub and other tools do render special styles for the files to make them easier to view. We simply display the “code” at this time. We do syntax highlight the code and perform minor visual adjustments.\n\nBecause of the nature of markdown files being designed to be easily read with minimal markup your markdown files are readable even if they contain a lot of markdown formatting.",
