    "text": "Hi there python developers!! I am currently using the HubSpot-api-cli 3.4.2 for invoking the APIs for my project. Right now, our team has decided to work with marketing events. Although I do not see the \"marketing-events\" in any of the cms/crm packages in the github repo here:Â <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-python/>\n\nIs this because Marketing Events is still in beta version in HubSpot? I have thought about a work around where I will have to use requests module from boto3 client and make the requests by passing URLs, parameters as shown here.\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/marketing/marketing-events>\n\nIf there is any python dev who is working on marketing events from HubSpot, please let me know your thoughts.\n\nMerry Christmas!!!\n\nThank You,\nManosij",
