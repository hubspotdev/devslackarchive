I'm still mid-way through this project - but have found the best way to export from Gmail for the API is into an xlsx / csv file using <https://script.google.com/home|Google Script> (to save the extra step from .mbox files).\n\nI'm currently in the process of configuring the API so happy to revert back when (or if!) I'm successful."
