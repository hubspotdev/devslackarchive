I would like to select my file (stored on my computer) and use a POST request on '<https://api.hubapi.com/filemanager/api/v3/files/upload>' to push it to my HubSpot FileManager. So far,\n• I tried to use &lt;input type=file&gt; : not working, error during rendering\n• I also tried to use fs.createReadStream(local_path) : error, my file cannot be found -_- \nAny ideas ?\n\nThx a lot !",
