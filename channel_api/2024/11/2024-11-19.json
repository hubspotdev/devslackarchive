    "text": "Hey, I have a question about a difference I found between batch updating and batch upserting in the v3 crm contacts api.\n\nWhen using the Contacts CRM API, I am able to successfully use the `crm/v3/objects/contacts/batch/upsert` endpoint to create or update contacts (I'm using a custom `idProperty` param - email).\nHowever, if I want to just update using the `crm/v3/objects/contacts/batch/update` , I get the following error:\n```{\"status\":\"error\",\"message\":\"Unable to perform update/upsert by non-unique 0-1 property email in portal ID 39874041\",\"correlationId\":\"562ef628-d647-409d-be5f-5b074f827089\",\"category\":\"VALIDATION_ERROR\"}  ```\nExample request:\n```curl --request POST \\\n  --url <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/batch/update> \\\n  --header 'authorization: Bearer pat-xxx' \\\n  --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"idProperty\": \"email\",\n      \"id\": \"testmail@mail.com\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"some_value\": 3\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}'```\nSupport seems to say that this is an API limitation, but maybe someone else has found a way to make this work? Ofc we can manually parse existing emails, and then only upsert those that already exist, but maybe there's a better solution"
