    "text": "Hi All\nWe are trying to fix a strange behavior in tickets associations.\nWe work with specific operations, where after closing a deal a ticket is created. This ticket has the association to company as well.\nThese deals have contact associations. When this contact is associated with more than 1 company, and a ticket is created, the association is switched to a primary company label. In other cases, the ticket could have more than 1 association.\nCould you help me solve this problem??",
