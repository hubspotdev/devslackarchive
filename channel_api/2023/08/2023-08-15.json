HubSpot supports multiple currencies, but to the best of my knowledge (definitely double check this) - you can’t track multiple currencies on a single record using native functionality.\n\nIf you had a coded action running to grab current exchange rates from one of the numerous APIs that provide that data, you could definitely, in theory, keep track of say…a converted deal amount displayed in USD, Euro, and GBP on separate properties. Or even concatenated within a text field if that floats your boat."
