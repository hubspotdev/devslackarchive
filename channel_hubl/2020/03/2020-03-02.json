I’d like to be able to do something like this\n\n```if child.label contains \"Phone\"```\nThen if it contains that string, I’d toggle the visibility of a phone icon. Same with “facebook” for the FB icon etc. The reason I don’t want to use a simple equals statement is that the phone number may change. For example they might set the menu label to `Phone: 1300 999 999` but change the figure in the future.\n\nIs this possible?",
