For example, if your HubSpot account is \"example\", the origination URL for CRM Cards would be \"<https://example.HubSpot.com>\".\n\nRegarding the CORS errors you are experiencing, it is important to ensure that your serverless function is properly configured to handle CORS requests. You may need to add the necessary headers to your serverless function's response to allow cross-origin requests from your HubSpot account domain.\""
