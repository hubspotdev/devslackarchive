I removed node-sass and sass-loader and then the packages installed without issues, but I had some issues when starting the app. Webpack then couldn't use env processes for some reason. Maybe it's webpack setup but I'm not proficient with it so that's why I wanted to check if anyone had a similar issue. :slightly_smiling_face:"
