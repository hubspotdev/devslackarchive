Would be really cool to have a user flow similar to the logo module, where users at the page level can edit the content optionally at the page level, or also could update the content in the page and then click a \"update all instances\" or similar button.",

Haven't had problems with it crashing the design manager, but had problems with marketing people adding huge images such that pages would take 30 seconds to load.\n\nIf instead of a size limit, would be even nicer if there was an image optimizer to reduce sizes automatically."
