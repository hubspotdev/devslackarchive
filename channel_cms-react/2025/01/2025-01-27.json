See screenshots\nWhat's the desired behavior? am i missing something? Is there way to 'force' it to return the default data I pass to group [in localhost ofc]?",

The reason providing the hubl isn't working is that hubl needs to be executed server side so when that code is in an island (client side), the hubl gets processed as a string. You would likely need to use the hubLDataTemplate export to get the HTML for the video and pass that along to your component. I will play around with this and see what I can get working. "

In hublDataTemplate I extract the thank you message and apply hubl's filter `render` . Then pass directly the HTML to the form.\nThe problem is finding the form in the layout. I ended up searching in `content.layoutSections.dnd_area.rows`. Quite nasty.\nIs there a better way to get the form in hubl?"
