    "text": "Hello HubSpot family, does anyone know of an experience mobile app developer? We paid $300K for a mobile app over the course of 5 years with great features, we took it down after COVID. But now with a somewhat new concept, we want to take what we have already built and reframe it into another purpose, yes there would be slight rebranding but we would still want the same features we have already built with more integrations to serve the military community. However, our existing and other app developers are saying we would need to create a whole new app. My mind is blown as to why and if we are picked in the wrong way. Any help is greatly appreciated!",
