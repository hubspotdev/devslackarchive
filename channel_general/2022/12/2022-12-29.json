Am at a bit of a loss as to why this might be. The video sits in a modal lightbox using the folllowing embed - any clues would be massively appreciated, thanks very much!\n```&lt;div class=\"modal-content animate__animated animate__zoomIn animate__faster\"&gt;\n{% video_player \"embed_player\" overrideable=False, type='hsvideo2', hide_playlist=True, viral_sharing=False, embed_button=False, autoplay=False, hidden_controls=False, loop=False, muted=False, full_width=False, width='1920', height='1080', player_id='96231789828', style='', conversion_asset='{\"type\":\"CTA\",\"id\":\"7c78121c-6e85-499b-9c54-95688b8ba50d\",\"position\":\"POST\"}' %}\n&lt;/div&gt;```\n<https://www.getsona.com/>",
