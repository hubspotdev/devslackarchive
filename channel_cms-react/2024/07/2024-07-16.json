    "text": "Hey everyone, I have a bit of a brain freeze moment. I'm using the new `getServerSideProps` function in a module's index to get some data. Basically, I'm making an external API POST request with an `authToken` that's generated after basic auth to the API (user and pass).\n\nNow I need to make the same call but from the Island. Since I can't use secrets in an Island, how can I still use the API POST request function from the server side?",
