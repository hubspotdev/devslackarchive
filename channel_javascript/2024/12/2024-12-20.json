If it is a certain property or through a form submission. \n\nIf it is through a property, then you just need to make sure that is updated when this new item comes in. \n\nIf it is via form submission Iâ€™d like to add a property update to how it starts. \n\nThose are two directions you can go that would provide the least resistance and have minimal time and effort needed"
