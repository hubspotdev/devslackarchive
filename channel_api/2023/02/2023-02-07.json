Also, the call task title shows up as the old call task title, even though for the new call task I called it something else.\n\nFor example, for the task in the screenshot below, I first created it on Feb 5 and completed it, and created a new call task with the same person on Feb 7.\n\nNot sure if this is a bug in the API or by design, but does anyone have a way around this? More specifically, is there a way to see that the task hasn't actually been completed, even though \"hs_taskstatus\" shows up as completed?",
