    "text": "I have a wordpress website with the HubSpot JS website tracking code on the site. Its tracks all the page views, forms, etc\n\nHowever, we just embedded a calculator on the page that is in an <https://outgrow.co/|iframe from a 3rd party> (this also contains form fields and when the form is filled it sends the record to HubSpot which comes up as \"offline sources\")\n\nWe set it up so the tracking code will fire within the iframe but it is not tying together any web activity prior to the calculator form fill. So we miss out on any attribution.\n\nDo you have any ideas on how to make this work?",
