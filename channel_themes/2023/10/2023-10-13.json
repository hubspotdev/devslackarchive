    "text": "Hi all! I'm trying to create a blog theme for my company. Instead of starting from scratch, I've created a child theme of the Growth theme and have been cloning files over as needed.\n\nWhen I edit the CSS files in my theme, changes are reflected on the published blog page immediately, but when I edit the theme files (blog-index.html, blog-listing), I don't see any changes taking place. I've double checked that these templates are loading from my custom theme, so I am not sure what would be the best way to go about developing this theme. It's very difficult when I can't see any changes happening.\n\nThanks in advance for any help offered!",
