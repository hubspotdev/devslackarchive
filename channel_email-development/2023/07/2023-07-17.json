    "text": "Hi! I have a standard use case question. In my email CTA I want to redirect the user to an iOS app (if installed) or redirect to a webpage. I can see possibly two solutions:\n• CTA with a module to capture the click and use javascript to run the redirect or\n• CTA redirects to a webpage which has redirect rules or javascript to then redirect to the iOS app\nDo you feel these are valid solutions? Especially with the first one, I am concerned about CTA metrics being captured.",
