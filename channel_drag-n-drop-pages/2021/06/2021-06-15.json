    "text": "I'm having the same issues and have tried pretty much everything but the options still won't show. At first it wasn't working on Chrome so I switched to firefox then after a while it automatically stopped working there too so then I moved to Edge then about a week later it stopped working there also. Can't see Section, column options at all. It is not extensions related as deleted all extensions from firefox and did a fresh install but still no luck. The options seem to be showing for the rest of my team on both mac and windows, and all the browsers I'm trying to work on.\n\nWhat is weirder is that it seems to work on specific themes only. I thought maybe we were doing something wrong in the theme setup, but the pre existing HubSpot themes on the portals have the same issue. The issue is becoming extremely frustrating as now I'm unable to properly edit pages on any browser."
