    "text": "Hey! I have media queries in my CSS adjusting the padding of modules\nat media (max-width: 400px){\n .lp-padding {\npadding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;\n}\n}\notherwise the style is padding: 50px 100px 50px 100px;\n\nFor some reason the preview of the landing mage on a cell phone with less than 400px is still pulling the main padding, not the at media width. I understand mobile first development and unfortunately due to the template HS created it is built with mobile in media queries...\n\nAny ideas are appreciated. I've tried adding !important and breaking it out into padding-top, padding-left, etc.... nothing has worked so far"
