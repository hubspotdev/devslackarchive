    "text": "Thanks <@U3T21PDBK>! My understanding is that the `property` parameter controls what post data is included in the search. So if I search for “webinar” it would return posts that have “webinar” in the title, body OR tags (or author, description etc). However, what I was looking for is more of a multifaceted search where I could search for posts with a title, description, or body that match “email marketing” AND have a tag that matches “webinar.” I don’t think I was able to solve that."

    "text": "Ultimately my solution was to use the search API to return a pool of posts matching the search term, then use js to filter them by tag in our React component… which I think overall worked out to be a more flexible solution."
