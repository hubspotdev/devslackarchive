    "text": "The Form component is a bit buggy. My learnings:\n• Unless you change the field \"Thank you message\" for the form in the editor, it does not take anything (it ignores the default thank you message of the form you choose).\n• If the \"Thank you message\" contains a link or an image, the message is truncated before the link or the image. For example, if the message is: \"Thank you, _contact us_ for more information\" with _contact us_ being a link, it will just show \"Thank you, \".\nMaybe someone from HubSpot can take a look."
