If anyone or their clients currently use the collected forms tool, we've just released a beta where collected forms will now map to existing HubSpot properties instead of creating new properties: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/getting-started-with-the-HubSpot-crm-free/how-to-use-the-collected-forms-tool>\n\nThis is automatically un-gated to all new portals going forward, but if anyone has any existing customers who already use collected forms in their portal and would like this functionality please feel free to fill out this form and I can un-gate them for this feature: <https://share.hsforms.com/115ljizaGS5q4tsFPc5Fx8g1btlk>"
