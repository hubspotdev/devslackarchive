For an MVP we are considering a CRUD API to allow partners to Create, Read, Update and \"Delete\" a Campaign. We also wanted to consider Data Retrieval. From an Campaign perspective (not so much the assets of a Campaign), what data would you need to retrieve?  What would you do with the data and why?\nIf anyone is interested in a deeper conversation about use cases, please set some time to chat <https://meetings.HubSpot.com/byung|HERE>",

    "text": "I think you’re mixing up the 2 primary discounting mechanisms when working with the API. Discounts at the line item level are dictated using one of 2 properties: hs_discount_percentage (for percentage based line item discounts), or “discount” (flat discounts).\n\nThe discounts created, stored and retrieved as dedicated objects via a dedicated endpoint are only used for quote level discounts, as far as I’m aware. So within your example, you wouldn’t try to set a discount using an associations array. You’d just add it as a value using the appropriate line item discount property, as described above."
