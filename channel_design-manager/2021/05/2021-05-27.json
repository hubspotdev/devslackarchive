I am brand new to HubSpot as of today, how can I execute the code and run console logs and such in design manager(trying to see the data objects and variables). Or do i need to set up my local environment and connect the CLI for that. I am the only dev so you guys are my best resource as of now! Any help would be appreciated.",
