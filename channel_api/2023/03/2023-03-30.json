I'm TravelgateX Product Manager, so let me maybe give you some user context and more information about the problem we are (desperately :sweat_smile:) trying to solve here :\n• We have integrated HS API into our Website and right now, the conversations thread is displayed in one single \"box\" with lots of emails one after each other. This is obviously a very bad UX, and on top of that, this generates lots of difficulties in terms of tickets management for our Customer Care team. I'm adding a screenshot below this message with an example of how our thread is currently being displayed in our Website integrated with HS.\n• So, the problem-to-be-solved is basically to have this thread, linked to a specific ticket, look like a \"state-of-the-art\" thread, with comments one after another, even when the comment has been sent by email to our Customer Care and is retrieved through HubSpot. Actually, what we're looking for is exactly what we see when dealing with tickets with HS support, I'm also attaching an example of what we're looking for to be able to expose in our website, in the second screenshot below.",
