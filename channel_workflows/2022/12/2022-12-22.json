I am relatively new to coding and this is my first custom code in HubSpot, so this might be a stupid question. However, if I add logging, where does this logging show up? Where can I see it? Thanks a lot in advance",

If you click \"Details\" right under \"Back to workflows\" in the top left corner you get to the summary of enrollments etc.\n\nClicking \"Action logs\" there will show you which actions have been triggered and next to each of them (when hovering at least) you get a button to see details.\n\nThat's where any logs will show, as well as the output fields. I usually keep some logs in different parts of my code, at least when my workflow is new, to make it easier to backtrack when something went wrong."
