There are two aspects - An in-person auction for items, and then a fund-in-need paddle raise. So we were thinking looking to do a registrant page w/in HubSpot... so I'll need to have those registrants that \"won\" the auction, and did a paddle raise flow over from whatever platform we choose (and connect with the registrants). We would also want to have a payment option available.\n\nNow that I'm typing this up - I'm thinking we may need to do the registrant page in the event platform (to allow for the payment for ticket purchase) and house the CC info for the auctions..."
