Always seems to be a good 1-2 second delay on coded CTAs where the CTA loads the image fallback and then it loads the coded version. You can see an example here: <https://www.virnigmfg.com/> in the hero section with the Request a Quote and Find a Dealer CTAs."

So, I have say 14 blogs in “Resources” and I click on that tagged category I only see 13 on return? However, when I look at the inspect code the “filter-linked-count” is showing the exact amount of blogs. Not sure where the issue is happening?"
