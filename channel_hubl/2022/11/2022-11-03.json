    "text": "We’d like to get the label of a choice field option. However to our understanding it’s not possible?\n\nScenario:\n\nA sorter + a list of products.\n\nOn a product the editor can select multiple use cases via the choice field (fx. “House &amp; Villas”, “Cardealer”, “Appartments” etc.). This would be the labels and the values would be “villas”, “cardealer” and “appartments”.\n\nThe thought was then to populate the sorter with the choice field labels added on a product and then some JS to create a hide/show function per use case.\n\nWe could set the value equal to the label, however the language is not english and choices can contain spaces and ampersands etc.\n\nIt seems this exact issue was requested back in 2019, but it seems that in 3 years nothing has happened regarding choice labels: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Choice-Field-Value-vs-Label/td-p/451572>"
