    "text": "Hi guys! I hope things are going well for you. I am looking for someone who already knows how to use the HS and how to create a website as a developer. I have a problem understanding the concept of it in general and have no idea how to begin. The reading and videos on the website are too much content I do not really have time to go through right now. Is there anyone who would be able to make a quick online call with me and help me to answer my questions? Not too much maybe 20min or such?\n\nI have experience with VS; html, css, js ... I need HubSpot for my student job. Thank you for your time!",
