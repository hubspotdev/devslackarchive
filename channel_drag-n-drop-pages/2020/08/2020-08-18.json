    "text": "What is best practice for nesting a custom button module inside of a Theme module? Attempting to nest the custom button module inside of a Theme module renders the \"module is disabled in this context\" error in the design manager - the alternative I suppose is to add the button markup directly into the Theme module and allow the editor to select the button style, button position, button text etc, but this feels redundant as these editing options are already available in my custom button module. Any thoughts?",
