Would be really helpful to understand how things should be configured etc as I’m unsure if there’s any quirks to be aware of in building components for the HubL fields etc. If anyone has anything on this I’ll gladly buy them a :beer:.",

I've been doing this using a third-party framework on my website (it tracks sesssion, duration, interactions and many other stuff) but I'd like to know if I can do this whilst using HubSpot only. I've read some info on HubSpot's marketing and events API, which can get me some data with the Web Analytics route, but it's still in beta phase and there aren't many variables in this route as there are in the framework I've been using already.\nKind regards :heart:"
