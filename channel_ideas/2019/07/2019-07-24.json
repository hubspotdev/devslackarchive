It requires discipline/training to write CSS one way only.\n\nOne possible way to work through this if training is not an option is to have a raw.css file that they can update.... then monthly you pull that code out and add it to your less files and send them an email saying you have done so.\n\nLESS and SASS makes things more difficult but should be embraced unless you get a mess."
