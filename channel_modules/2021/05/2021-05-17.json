    "text": "Hi All,\n\nUrgent assistance needed and heavily appreciated if someone can suggest a solution or point me in the right direction.\n\n*Context* - Creating media bridge integration using the new media bridge api.\n*Problem* - When embeding videos via embed_field if the videos provided have an “hs_oembed_url” of a youtube link works fine when viewing it in Module “design-previewer”. When I say works fine, I mean the left hand panel shows the preview and “size” options and right hand panel shows the embeded video. However, if I put in my own video with correct Oembedd structure, it loads the video correctly on the right hand side but ends up with attached error on the left hand side. Does anyone know what the left hand side expects from Media URL ?",
