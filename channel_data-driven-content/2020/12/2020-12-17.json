    "text": "The Right ER with HubDb for a cars database. Hi!, i´m creating a cars catalog within HubDb and i´m not sure if this  is the best solution  for it.  So i will have  table1.- with brand names, Table 2.- will be  brand_name01 and all the details ( columns) i wish to have, table 3.- with brand_name02 and all the details (Columns), iterate until last brand_name.\n\ni will use dynamic pages in order to create the catalog. URL will be like <http://domain.com/cars/brand_name01/uuid|domain.com/cars/brand_name01/uuid>.\n\nif i need to update the catalog i can use API and Serverless if need it.\n\nIf i also have the same catalog as an object products/services how to mantain the syncro between HubDb and the Object?\nthanks in advance for your feedback :wink:"

    "text": "Hi! We have a HubDB table with images in it. When used from HubL and with the `resize_image_url` or just by doing `&lt;img src=\"{{ img.url }}\" withd=\"400\" height=\"200\"&gt;` HubSpot seems to turn the URL of the image to `https://.../hub/XXXX/hubfs/name.jpg?width=400&amp;height=200&amp;name=name.jpg`  which works with scaling.\n\nWhen fetching the rows with JavaScript from the HubDB API the returned image url is `https://.../hubfs/XXX/name.jpg` and when served from this path the scaling does not work even with the query params applied. Now we could change `/hubfs/XXX/name.jpg` to `/hub/XXX/hubfs/name.jpg` dynamically but this seems really error prone if something changes in HubSpot.\n\nCan we somehow get the API to return the URL as such that it can be scaled with query string parameters?",
