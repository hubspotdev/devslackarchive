    "text": "Hello, Im having some issues with HubSpot form not rendering in Wordpress with Barba.js.\nSo i have 2 pages, transition from page A to page B does not load the form. it has the\n&lt;script&gt; hbspt.enqueueForm({ portalId: xxxxx, formId: \"xxxxx\", target: \"#hbspt-form-xxxxxx\", region: \"eu1\" }); &lt;script&gt;  and the &lt;div class=\"hbspt-form\" id=\"hbspt-form-xxxxxx\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; but nothing inside this div.\nBut if the page B is reloaded the form is there. Is there any option to do something like hbspt.init()? i tried hbspt.forms.create({}) but got an error hbspt.forms.create is not a function.\n\nThank you.",

That often happens if you're deferring the Form JS script but have the call/reference to the `create` method somewhere in the page and not modified to wait until the dependency is loaded."
