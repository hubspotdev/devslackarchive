Or even some type of validation on the images…where you can set the min/max width and height and if the user doesn’t upload that size, it errors. ACF for Wordpress has both crop and validation and it’s SO nice. Users don’t read the tooltip or inline helper text if you recommend the image size there. Can’t trust em! :smile:"
