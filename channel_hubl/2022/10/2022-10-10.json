I have been working on this email for the past week with no luck :sweat_smile: This is my first time trying dynamic content in a HS email.\n\nI have a HubDB table uploaded and am trying to get info from the table to appear in my email for each recipient. TL:DR, we are sending emails alerting members of their new local reps, and have 40+ reps. I cannot spend my time building 40 unique emails, so this was the solve. Just trying to problem-solve getting their rep’s name to appear in the email. Would love any and all help and suggestions here!\n\n```{% set query = \"agm_name__eq=\"~agm_name %}\n{% for agm in hubdb_table_rows(54884801, query) %}\n{% set agm_name = contact_agm.name %}\n&lt;span&gt;\n&lt;p color=\"#FFFFFF\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;\"&gt;\n{{ agm_name }}         \n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n{% endfor %}```"
