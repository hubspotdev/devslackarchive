    "text": "<@U7SL518D6> <@U015550V6C8> I did it. I've made a module which contain my classes (ie classes names) and I choose to apply my class on a block (drag and drop area), a section, a container, a column, or a row in a colum. In my template, some javascript parses all classes and elements and insert classes on elements. It works like a charm, even if it would be easier to choose classes not in a separate module, but in the tab of the element (screenshot below). It's super easy to change a style on many pages, and I don't have obsolete classes when I delete an element (module, column, section, block). My classes names are like: \"padding small\", \"padding medium\", \"padding big\", etc. and are in groups of styles.",
