    "text": "Hi there, I have a client with a use case for a custom card that displays some contact data, an image and some static html data. That part I have been able to tackle, but they also need to be able to print just those components. I'm fairly new to react, so I'm just learning that window.print() isn't going to work, so I'm attempting to use <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-to-print|react-to-print>, but so far no luck. Just wanted to check to see if there were any limitations as far as third-party packages like this one go when used in the HS CRM, before I dedicate more time to troubleshooting. Thanks for your time!",

The TLDR is we don't allow any 3rd party UI components and we restrict access to many browser APIs (like window you mentioned) So if I'm understanding right.
