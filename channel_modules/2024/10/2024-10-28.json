The question is, I would like to show a dynamic image in my automated workflow emails and whenever I change the image design, it should be automatically updated in all emails that are using this module without any manual human touch. What is the ideal/safest/easiest way to do that? Creating a module via design manager? If yes, what would be ideal HTML code for this?\n\nThank you in advance",

    "text": "Hey <@U06P496Q6LE>,\nthere are a few ways you can achieve this.\n1. replacing the image in the file-manager\n    ◦ most easiest solution\n    ◦ no custom code required\n    ◦ You'll loose the previously used image everytime you'll update it in the files manager\n2. creating a global module in the design-manager\n    ◦ It could basically be just an img-tag\n    ◦ super easy\n    ◦ Updates to this module are done in the global module editor\n3. create a HubDB\n    ◦ quite overkill solution for something like this, but possible\n    ◦ you'd need to create a custom module with an img-tag and add the HubDB column as src value\n    ◦ everytime you'd change the path in HubDB, it would automatically update the module\n4. Create a custom module and a variables file in the theme\n    ◦ Like HubDB it's kinda overkill\n    ◦ Will require a custom module which imports the variables file and set's the variable as the src value\n    ◦ You'd need to update the image path in the variables file if you like to change it\n\n The default code for option 2 could look something like this\n```&lt;img src=\"{{module.image.src}}\"&gt;```\nFor option 3:\n```{% set row = hubdb_table_row(HUBDB-ID, HUBDB-ROW-ID)  %} \n&lt;img src=\"{{row.image}}\"&gt;```\nFor option 4:\n_variables-file:_\n```{% set image_path = \"PATH-TO-IMAGE\" %}```\n_module:_\n```{% import 'PATH-TO-VARIABLES-FILE' %}\n...\n&lt;img src=\"{{ image_path }}\"&gt;```"
