    "text": "Hi <@UFE1D9UU8>,\n\nA theme is basically a collection of resources. Those resources include Modules, Templates and the various underlying CSS and JS files that are responsible for making them work and function the way they do.\n\nFurthermore Themes allow you to create specific `modules` intended for use on the templates your theme includes. In addition to this it's also possible to create `Theme fields` which allow you to define settings that will take affect across all of the templates contained within the theme.\n\nThere are a few really good resources that help to explain things in a little more detail. You'll find them below:\n\n<https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/building-blocks/themes>\n\nand\n\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/website-pages/create-website-content-using-a-theme>"
