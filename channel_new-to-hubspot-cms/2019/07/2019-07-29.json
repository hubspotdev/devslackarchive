    "text": "&gt; 2) What is the grid HubSpot uses based on? Is it Bootstrap or something else?\n\nHubSpot's drag-and-drop editor relies on Bootstrap 2. You're able to use whatever framework you prefer using \"Coded Templates\", however, you may lose a little of the drag and drop functionality.\n\nI feel community developers use 1/2 DND and 1/2 coded templates.... really depends on who the end user is of the pages.\n\nSide note on CSS - You CAN use SASS/LESS/etc locally using the <#CLJJXGTC0|local-development>"

    "text": "Luke,\n\nThank you for the information. I started coding my navigation and footer modules with the base brand styles and was so very happy to see the SAAS/Less for CSS.  This is a best practice I use outside of HubSpot and am happy to be able to continue it here.\n\nThe other question I have is in relation to common files and templates.  I feel like there needs to be a higher level \"site template\" that contains the css and js files needed for your site as a whole. It feels weird to me to have to associate base template files (main.css for example) to every template page.  It would be valuable to be able to set this once in a site template and be able to assign page templates to the site template to automatically acquire these files. Is there something in Settings that I have missed that will do this? Thanks so much for your time and insight."
