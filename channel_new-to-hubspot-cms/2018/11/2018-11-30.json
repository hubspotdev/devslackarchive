I'm new to HubSpot but already like that a lot.\n\nI've got a question regarding the e-mail signature. Is it possible to have a dynamic email signatures?\nWhat I would like achieve is to be able to edit a simple HTML code just once instead of copying and pasting each time on one another account. I was wondering if there is an option to have like a snippet thing ? :grin:\n\nAny answer or solution will be much appreciated :grinning:"

    "text": "Hey Kamil, welcome in! I would suggest making a custom module that is changed via a choice field. Create a list of options in the module for potential senders then in the HTML/HubL editor set up some logic like this:\n\n{% if module.sender == \"Employee 1\" %}\n    &lt;HTML for Employee 1's signature /&gt;\n{% elif module.sender == \"Employee 2\" %}\n    &lt;HTML for Employee 2's signature /&gt;\n... and so on for the rest of your options\n{% endif %}\n\nThat way the email senders don't need to mess with any code when composing their emails :slightly_smiling_face: Let me know if any of that doesn't make sense!"
