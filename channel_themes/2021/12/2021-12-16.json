I'm pretty sure theres no required specific dimensions for marketplace. The important part is that the image used helps differentiate one template from another.  They are used primarily for template selection and section selection in the UI.\n\nSection templates - my recommendation is to use the chrome inspectors node screenshot tool to capture just the section itself regardless of size. (If you use chrome, obviously use the equivalent feature for your browser of choice.)\n\nThe screenshots should be taken on desktop."
