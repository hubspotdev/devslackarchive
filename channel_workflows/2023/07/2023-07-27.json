Any one can point me to the right direction?\nAlso could this be due to associationTypeId ? which is just a random number (that doesn't current exist in the list of associationtypes. I tried to create an new association label between deals/quote or quote/line items or quote / quote template, but that does not seem to be possible.\nThanks :pray:",
