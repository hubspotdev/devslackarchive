I have a integration with an `external website`, I wrote some javascript code and I uploaded to the `HubSpot Files`, but when I have a lot of traffic on that external website the Javascript code is not working correctly, does somebody know if is it ok to use `HubSpot as CDN` or it's better if I change the CDN to `cloudflare (example)`?
