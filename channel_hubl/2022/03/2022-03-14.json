Are dynamic calls possible for properties?\n\n\nFor example, in PHP I can do this: `$object-&gt;{$numberVariable}`\n\nSo, is this at all possible in HubL? `object.custom_property_{ numberVariable }`\n\nIf not, I am about to make one of the largest, most horrifying CMS templates ever. I would love some feedback!",

I do usually go for `pprint` (which I know you said you’ve tried), but if it’s just for debugging, I also check the “Developer Info” in the sprocket menu. I have a <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa|chrome extension> that formats the JSON, which helps quite a bit.",
