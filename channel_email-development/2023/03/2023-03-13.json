    "text": "Hi there! I'm working on integrating the HubSpot Transactional Email API into my Node.js project to send account verification emails, but I'm having some trouble getting started. Is there a HubSpot developer who could help me out or point me in the right direction?\n\nHere's what I've done so far:\n- Created a HubSpot account and obtained an API key\n- Installed the \"request\" and \"request-promise\" npm packages\n- Tried to select the transactional-email scope in HubSpot, but received an error message saying it's unavailable for my account\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",

They are running email from the HubSpot portal (parent company) and so each company had initially had a subscription in settings.  They want to have each sub company to have sub-subscriptions (newsletter, products, spring email).  Obviously there is no way to make a 2 level deep subscription tier in settings and currently all companies subscriptions show up in the email preferences page.  Is it possible/advisable  to do website pages for each company that only show the sub-subscriptions for the specific sub-company and store the sub-subscription yes/no on the contact object?  If possible that would be a delight moment for them but I fear its a custom job or not happening."
