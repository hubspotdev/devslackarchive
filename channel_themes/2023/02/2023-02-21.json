For some reason when I click on the Global Header of my theme (to edit it) the header doesn't appear once I'm in the Global Editor.\n\nIt's _possible_ I deleted the section containing the global header by accident at some point? :thinking_face:\n\nAnyone have an idea on how to get the Global Header back? I haven't published the update so the header still exists on the site, it's only \"missing\" when I attempt to edit it in the Global Editor",
