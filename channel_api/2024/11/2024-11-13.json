Basically, I would expect HubSpot to auto-fill this property, but it is not reflected on the call object. When retrieving the call, we see `hs_created_by=null` . Also, on the call table in the HubSpot UI, the “Activity created by” col says “No user”.\n\nThe calls do log with the correct `HubSpot_owner_id`. Does anyone know why the `hs_created_by` property would not be set?\n\nThanks so much!",

I can use a search but not a direct ID fetch.  For one the prop has to be created using API to get a unique value as that option doesnt exist in the UI for products. Secondly for search to work it cannot be hidden. I seem to recall in the past that it had to be available in the global search to work as a custom ID field but I dont see a way to set that using the API. A bit baffled",
