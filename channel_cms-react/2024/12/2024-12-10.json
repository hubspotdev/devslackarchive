There is a problem:\nAfter the first `npm run deploy` everything works as normal\nBut if you make changes in the `templates` folder and then deploy, the build and deploy are successful, but when selecting templates, the templates are *missing*.\nIf you make changes in `components`, for example in the Header module and do not make any changes in `templates` after the first deploy, then everything works as before.\nI create a copy of the template only with a different name and still an error\nIn general, the problem is only when changing templates and subsequent deploy\nDeployment of other projects also does not display templates until you delete everything and do the first deployment\nMaybe someone knows what the problem is?",
