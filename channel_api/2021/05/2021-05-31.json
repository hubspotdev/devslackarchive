I was able to do that for standard objects using the OAuth and now I want to extend the capabilities to custom objects.\n\nMy question is that, will I be able to load data to custom objects using standard APIs, or would I need to enroll in the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/custom-objects-schema-pilot|Custom Objects OAuth Pilot Program>? The user will create the custom object on HubSpot and we just want to load data into it.\n\nPS: We are building an ETL tool and the features of loading data would work for multiple companies",
