Our team is trying to put a theme on the marketplace, but there is an error in the source code, the community manager suggested that the error causes the Google console to loop and seems to be related to \"Module compatibility with themes\". But how can I specifically find out the location and type of the error so that I can fix it? Validation does not end and it is impossible to see the error. I used cms-react, maybe I wrote in the wrong thread, I apologize in advance",
