    "text": "this seems like an easy answer, but i’m having trouble finding an actual answer.\n\ni’m writing a lambda that eventually will post data to a contact record. First step is to retrieve the contact. (I am not posting at this time.)\n\nI have a very rudimentary “gate” form: Enter email address and submit. I can see the hutk cookie update every time I submit this form with a different address.\n\nThere are four contacts in the sandbox portal. One has two associated email addresses; the others have only one.\n\nWhen I fill out my form with one of the “two-address contact” addresses, and use that new hutk in a Postman test with the API endpoint and my sandbox key, I get the correct contact record. When I fill out my form with any of the other three contacts’ email addresses, and use those hutk values in the Postman test, I get a 200 response with “is_contact”: false.\n\nI would understand this if it were returning ALL contacts as false, but only some? I have worked through this repeatedly and gotten the same results every time. Any ideas?\n\nFor the record, I am not logged into HubSpot as an admin in the browser I’m testing this lambda in, so my admin record is not interfering. Also, I have cleared HS cookies in the Inspector many, many times.",
