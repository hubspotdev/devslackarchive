Would anyone have any ideas of tips on the best way to edit an application listed in the marketplace and test it before publishing?\nI have an app in the marketplace and I would like to edit it. Before editing and submitting it for review by the HubSpot team, I would like to test it internally with several people. Does anyone have any advice on how to do this?
