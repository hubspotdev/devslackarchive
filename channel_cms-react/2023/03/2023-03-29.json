    "text": "<@U02LG4AU9JS>, not sure I follow. Maybe you are asking if you can/will be able to:\n• Reference modules inside of modules (at a building-block kind of level)?\n• Have a module contain a D&amp;D area (or similar) so that other modules can be dragged in?\n• (Maybe related and asked before) Be able to reference JS modules inside JS partials?\n• Something else?\nAs of right now, I don’t think we are considering the first two bullets very much. But if you have some need or pain there, we’d love to hear more detail! (In another Slack thread/email/call/whatever you’d like)\n\nAnd we hope to enable the third bullet, but we’re not quite actively working on that yet."
