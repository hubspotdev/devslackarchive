    "text": "Hello - I'm looking to understand how folks are implementing server to server integrations with HubSpot where no user or browser is available to provide consent at app install time. In an api key scenario, we provide an api key to auth, and then start submitting requests as needed. In the OAuth2 world a user needs to click on links in a browser to provide consent from my understanding. How are folks accomplishing server to server OAuth2 on public apps in a headless environment?",
