    "text": "Hey all, do you know of a data source where I would be able to *get Monthly visitor numbers and geo of visitors data*? I'd like to match it against accounts we want to go after (small start-up, but wouldn't be able to check one-by-one)\n\nI am building out our ICP and one of the filters would be website visits volume and visitor geo (we need our target accounts to have at least 1.5M monthly traffic with the highest % of visitor country not larger than 85% of total traffic)\n\nI checked SimilarWeb but they seem to require a yearly subscription for $10k+ and I would just need a one-off export of this data.\nDo you know of any other feasible solutions here?"

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.
