So, I also used <http://webhook.site|webhook.site> and then recreated the requests locally in my test environment with a \"transmitter\" script for my receiver. It turns out the reason I wasn't able to validate my requests is because in my script, I was sending the request body in with the python function `json.dumps(...)`. However, this was automatically adding extra bytes of whitespace which made the request not truly match the intended V3 signature when applying the cryptography algorithm. It is working now. If anyone else has similar issues to discuss, let me know."
