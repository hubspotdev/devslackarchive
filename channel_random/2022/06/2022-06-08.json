    "text": "Hi all, we have a client which has set up a subdomain as the main domain (so they use <http://subdomain.website.com|subdomain.website.com> in every communication and also their email).\n\nWe have set the new website on <http://www.website.com|www.website.com> due to these limitations. Now we want to set a redirect from subdomain. towards www., but we cannot set a CNAME within HubSpot, this is already used for the email. What is the best workaround for this to get a redirect in place for the subdomain towards the www.\n\nThanks!!!"
