And I can't wrap my head what would be the best way to build things like news,events,case studies things that require a listing page and a detail page. One thing that comes to my mind are blog categories but I think blog should only be used for blogging."

Still would not consider it to be the nicest thing to have for content editors. And creating one more blog and use it for news and events, case studies would be the other solution I gues. Thank you for your answer."
