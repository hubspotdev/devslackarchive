    "text": "Hi there, I’m new to HubSpot and still figuring things out. Is there a concept called ‘API only’ user in HubSpot? We are planning to build an app to import leads from our platform to HubSpot and as far as I understand (going through different documentations), after the OAuth authentication, a HubSpot user has to login to connect the app with HubSpot.\n\nWhen we built the Marketo integration, the API only user came really handy as in some cases the end-customers will be using agencies to manage their campaigns and leads, and could easily create the API only user for the integration.\n\nWith the agency’s involvement, I was wondering how HubSpot handles these situations when it comes to REST integrations and is there a work-around here?\n\nAny help is appreciated.",
