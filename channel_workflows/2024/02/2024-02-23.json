    "text": "I'm having some trouble with using custom coded steps in a workflow. Sometimes this happens 'Custom code wasn't able to execute, but will retry soon' - however later when it retries there is always an error as it had part-executed the custom coded action but not the last part (it is creating something via API and retrieving an ID - and it cannot create again so the whole thing fails).\nDoes anyone know of a way to branch a workflow based on this message...? It appears I cannot intervene and I can later only branch on success/error of this action.\nEdited to add: The only way I can fix this in the short term is to split out my API calls into separate custom coded steps. not ideal so would prefer a way to resolve the above still if possible",
