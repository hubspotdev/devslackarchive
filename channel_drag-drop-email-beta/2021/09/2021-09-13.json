    "text": "Hi everyone, Have a quick question about HubSpot and Drag N Drop Emails. When using custom HTML coded emails in the HubSpot, how does HubSpot use these custom codes since it can easily rise security issues? Does development team have documentation on it? The reason why I ask is, I have added my own HTML email here and even though it is 80kbs on my computer, gmail clips it.",
