    "text": "Hey all. I'm creating a super simple series of landing pages using the theme 'growth'. I've copied the theme but have not edited a single line of code.. until now. i'm seeing this text breaking issue. Ive used Growth, and several HuBspot templates 100 or so times and have never had this issue. Please see photo of text break issue. please see css i've added to both the main.css and when that didnt work i edited the override css. Please help me i hate this and my client hates this, its so stubborn i dont know why its not working . The modules i'm  using are native HS modules i've used hundreds of times , they do NOT want custom coding - they want something simple & sustainable. * i should add i have tried *word-wrap: break-word;* as well",
