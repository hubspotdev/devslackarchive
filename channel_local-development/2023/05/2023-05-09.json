    "text": "Heya,\nhas anyone tried to localize sytem pages like 404, 500, search result page?\n\nSince they are just 'special templates' without any files like fields.json I don't see a way where the editor can choose what texts should be on them - HS has it hardcoded (f.e. \"Results for \"\" \"). It's possible to add a 'static module' to the template, but since there doesn't exist a UI to interact with the system page it wouldn't do anything. You only access/edit the page via the Settings/Pages/System Pages and select which Search Result Page the domain is suppose to use - pressing \"Edit\" here just sends you to the Design Manager for the template (html) file where you just see the hardcoded text(s).\n\nSoo, are there still no way to localize these pages? Previous posts have mentioned that people end up with using js to detect browser language and set the texts based on that, but then it means they are still hardcoded by us in some form, and if the user f.ex. always have English as their browser language but explore the website in their main language it doesn't really help - they'll the language would differ between 'normal pages' and 'system pages'."
