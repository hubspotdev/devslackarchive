HubSpot provides that to the workers, so declaring it a secret you want to provide is a conflict / error.\n\nOne thing I’m checking on our side though is the error should have been clear to remove that value from secrets, and from the screenshot, it doesn’t appear so clear.\n\nEdit: the error trying to reproduce on my end now looks like this:\n```The secret PRIVATE_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN referenced in the config file serverless.json is a reserved keyword and cannot be used. Create a secret under a different name by running `hs secrets add` or remove it from your `serverless.json` file. ```\nThis may be a recent adjustment, but if you aren’t seeing this warning in the future, do call it out."

Additionally, can this information in the popup be editable?\n2. *Detail Information in a Separate UI Card*: Can information be shown in a different UI card below a custom UI card table, reflecting detailed information based on the row selected in the table?\n3. *Filtering in Custom UI Card Tables*: Is filtering an option within these tables? For example, could a column with statuses be set to display only items marked as ‘new’?\nOther UI Card Related Questions:\n1. *Tabs within a UI Card*: Is it feasible to create tabs within a UI card for enhanced organization or navigation?\n2. *Expand Screen Functionality for Tables in UI Cards*: Can we implement a feature to expand a table to full screen within HubSpot as a popup?\nPopups in HS CRM:\n1. *Capabilities of Popups*: Are the functionalities mentioned above achievable within popups in HS CRM? Do popups offer more flexibility or different capabilities?\nI’d be grateful for your insights, suggestions, or examples from your experiences as we continue refining our project.\n\nLooking forward to engaging with your thoughts!",

    "text": "So a couple of quick points and then I'll go one by one for you.\nFirst popups are just iframes of webpages, these webpages can be HubSpot hosted or just any page. They aren't React Extensions. Iframes and Cards doesn't share state (besides things like query parameters).\n\nWhile talking about state it's important to mention that cards (even if they're in the same project) doesn't share state between them, the permanent state for most cards are HubSpot property or external databases. You can't change something on one card and see the effect immediately on a different card (reload required).\n\nNow one by one:\n\n1. you definitely can trigger an iframe on select of a row (wrap the row in a link component, it would just be one click through), and use the onClick event to trigger the iframe, I would pass the row id to the iframe as a query parameter.\n2. This is really tricky and so the short answer is no, I would suggest just keeping it all in the same card and using some dividers.\n3. Yeah you can definitely build out filters and searches, but you build them custom, it's not as plug and play as an CrmAssociationTable\n4. You definitely can do tabs with CRM cards, but the UI to indicate that you're on a new tab is sometimes a little tricky. I personally like to use the step indicator component, or button rows.\n5. Unfortunately no you can't make a table component full screen.\n6. Yeah like I explained above the iframes (popups) are entirely separate websites so you can build them out however you want."
