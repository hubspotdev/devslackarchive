    "text": "G'day Folks,\nMost campaign management and even attribution software falls far short of getting you a picture of what happened. They either focus only on conversions and not engagements and they don't take into consideration lifecycle stages. And most definitely don't allow you filter out engagements after the intro call or get aggregates broken down by persona.\n\nImagine being able to track the activities that key prospects make across their lifecycle stage. Or analyse activities across all prospects broken down by persona and then only activities before they became a client. It's called Journey Manager.\n\nPlease review us on Product Hunt - <https://www.producthunt.com/products/journey-manager>\nAnd for product hunters, there's a lifetime 10% off discount.",
