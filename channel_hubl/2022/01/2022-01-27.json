I was planning to limit the post inside this statement but seems like it's not possible based on the HubSpot documentation, but the pagination is possible because it says that :\n\n• simple listing is NOT affected by post limit\n• simple listing CAN be paginated\nare there any workaround for this without limiting the posts in the settings? here's what my blog listing code looks like\n\n```  {% if tag %}\n   {# inside here will be the list of tag related articles #}\n  \n  {% elif not simple_list_page %}\n   {# inside here will be the homepage of the blog listing #}\n  \n  {% elif simple_list_page %}\n   {# inside here will be the listing of the /all articles #}\n  {% endif %}```\n",
