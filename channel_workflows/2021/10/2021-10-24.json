We've been multiplying by decimals to calculate commissions, and found out that it was rounding down to be *0 instead of *0.2 -- obviously not good.\n\nI tried with *1.5 and it treated it like *1, so it must round down automatically. \n\nI haven't seen anything documented that you can't format decimals, and it allows you to type them in without warning, so I'm hoping this is just a glitch that can be fixed...?",

    "text": "Just realized it also rounds results of equations with whole numbers.\n\nI divided 8250 by 100 and got 82 rather than 82.5.\n\nSo maybe it's specifically the result rounding that's the issue. Again, can't see this documented anywhere so hoping it can be fixed. Rounding decimals like that will throw off a lot of data."
