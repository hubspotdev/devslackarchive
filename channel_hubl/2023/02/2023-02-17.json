I am trying to modify some style attributes of my custom module, but the  module_attribute tag doesn't seem to work for style attributes. This is the code I am using right now inside the template code. The module is working great in the template otherwise and the normal field attributes work just fine to modify, but for some reason, the style attributes won't display. Have any suggestions?",
