    "text": "Hi Community,\nTesting something here and not sure fully know what I maybe missing. Essentially trying to link HubSpot to \"Random Invoicing System\" The quotes would be created in HS and sent but needs to map to \"Random Invoicing System\" what exactly do I need from the random system in order for this to work? Thinking about using the CRM extension endpoint. Here is a screenshot of the logic....(I don't think there is an Quotes API from HubSpot but essentially it would be to link the other aspects)",
