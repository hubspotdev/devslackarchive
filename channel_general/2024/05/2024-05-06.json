Examples of sensitive information that will be covered by this rollout include government ID number, low-risk financial data, and non-HIPAA-covered medical information.\n\nWhy does it matter?\nEnabling customers to store sensitive data in HubSpot opens the door to more use cases that have not yet been possible for HubSpot users. Now, with sensitive data, users can collaborate effectively across teams, run reports using enhanced data, create segments, and more. With sensitive data, there’s no longer a need to leverage workarounds or keep this data outside of HubSpot.\n\nHow does it work?\nTo store sensitive information in your HubSpot account, users with Super Admin permissions can turn on the sensitive data setting. Once the setting is turned on, you can create custom properties that store sensitive information. Additionally, you can restrict user access to these properties using field level permissions."
