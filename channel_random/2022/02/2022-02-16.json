    "text": "Hello,\nI'm new to HubSpot development and not sure in which channel to ask this question, so i'll just try it here:\n\nWe're currently developing an integration for one of our customers.\nThis integration needs to save some preferences for it to work. I'm right now redirecting the user to our site after the installation, where s:he can adjust the settings.\nBut when i installed for example the \"Shopify\" integration, i had the oppurtinity to set some things up while installing the integration without leaving HubSpot.\nHow can i achive the same behaviour for my integration?\nOr, where can i find resources explaining how i can implement it?\n\nso basically, i'd like to have advanced options for my integration in HubSpot. Ideally accessible via the integration settings page.\nIs this possible for third-party integrations?"
