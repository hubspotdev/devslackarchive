I've added the blog field (`blog`) to the module and I'm looping through with a conditional statement to only loop through 3 but there seems to only be 1 item in `<http://module.blog|module.blog>` so I'm just wondering how this is meant to be done. Thanks!",

Please make this content private or contact the module creator.```\nDoes this mean I can't use the Deal object type in a programmable email module or is there something I can do to allow deals in public content?\nAlso, I'm very new to HubSpot. Is there somewhere to view more detailed logs?",
