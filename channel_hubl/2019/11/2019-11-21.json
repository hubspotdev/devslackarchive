    "text": "Any pointers as to the best way to force a redirect within a page?  Or, ideas around this: my client is using 'blogs' for their resource library - i.e. a blog for white papers, case studies, etc. - and they need to have a resource that shows up in the listing page which, once clicked on, redirects to a page on the site. My thought was to add a \"destination page\" field to the blog template, and then if that's set, redirect to the specified destination. Thoughts?"
