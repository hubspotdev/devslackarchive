Each \"Set\" will contain 2-4 \"Programs\" - another custom object. I am trying to display the associated Programs for a Set using <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/functions#crm-associations|crm_associations> but I cannot for the life of me find where the 'association type id' for 2 custom objects that is required. Any thoughts / ideas / suggestions?",

E.g. if I am viewing /blog I want the title to be \"Blog\", but if I'm viewing \"/blog/tag/events\" I want the title to be \"Events\".\n\nI've already built a custom blog_listing module - I just need to get the correct title at the top.",
