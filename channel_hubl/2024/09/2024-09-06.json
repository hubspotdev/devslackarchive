I am currently working on mambership forms and I'd like to know how to manage multiple languages.\n\nI know that there are some values I can pass directly in the member_register (for example) properties. I can then use {{ content.language }} and get these values as such:\n\n{% member_register \"my_register\"\n            email_label={{email_label}},\n            password_confirm_label={{password_confirm_label}},\n            password_label={{password_label}},\n            submit_button_text={{submit_button_text}}\n%}\n\nHowever, the generated code has more text that I'm not sure how to manage through HubL. Is there a way or should I just use JS?"
