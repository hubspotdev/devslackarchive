    "text": "You have to comply with trademark laws. A user should never confuse your app for the app you’re connecting their account to.\n\nFor example If you’re not Google, your name should not imply you are.\n\nI’d consult a lawyer that knows trademark law if you intend to use the name of a third party in your app name or any marketing materials.\n\nAlso HubSpot’s App Marketplace is not actively vetting whether you have license to use a trademark, that is your responsibility. For example if you named your app “Nintendo” HubSpot’s app marketplace could theoretically allow your app in, but Nintendo would have legal right due to the trademark to come after you. I’m not a lawyer, I can’t provide legal advice other than tell you go talk to a lawyer.\n\nWhat I’ve seen though in tech in trademark disputes in the past (not specific to HubSpot) the owner of the trademark typically wins in court all profits you ever had while using the trademark, as well as potentially additional money for damaging the value of their trademark. If your business used their trademark for a long time, this could bankrupt your entire business."
