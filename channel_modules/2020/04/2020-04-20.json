    "text": "gah! this is so close. by fetching another module, I realized the design tools add a `\"tab\": \"CONTENT\"` property to fields. I tried setting this to `\"tab\": \"STYLES\"` to which I got the error `Cannot deserialize value of type com.HubSpot.content.model.customwidgets.fields.group.Tab from String \"STYLES\": value not one of declared Enum instance names: [STYLE, CONTENT] (line:-1, column:-1)` and upon setting the type to be STYLE it accepted it! alas, those fields are now no longer under “options” but “styles” remains disabled. SO CLOSE! <@U6GNQ7JBU> if you wanna throw a little momentum behind this, I think it’d be so useful! in my case, I’m giving my users the ability to pick from a set of classes to apply margin, etc with predefined values"
