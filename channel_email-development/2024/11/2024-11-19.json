    "text": "hey all, i'm currently working on an integration for email subscriptions using the `communication-preferences` API. we needed to allow users to resubscribe after they've unsubscribed, so we used the new V4 endpoint `<https://api.hubapi.com/communication-preferences/v4/statuses/batch/write>`\n\nfrom what i understand, this should allow us to do what we need to do. issue is our connected app doesn't have access to the scopes for this endpoint, and we can't enable it in the scopes either.\n\nany ideas why? i've contacted tech support already and they've sent me here... so any help appreciated!",
