    "text": "Hi ,\n\nI am totally new to the HubSpot,node JS etc.\nAnd I was also facing same type of issue.\nBut today I have found my answers and below were the options that I have checked and corrected.\nIssue: In the network tab of the page, response was totally blank.\nSteps I have followed:\n1. Debugged the serverless function containing js file to make sure that my axios.get(url) is returning data.\n2. Corrected the secret api key to get the api key val in the url of-axios.get(url) , not as undefined.\n3. After doing all these corrections I have updated the returned response(from the axios.get(url) ) data-type into json(.then(respnse =&gt; respnse.json())) in my- await fetch(url, requestOptions), in the HubSpot module.\nAnd all of these steps has resolved my issue.\n\nThanks &amp; Regards,\nMohesh Borah"
