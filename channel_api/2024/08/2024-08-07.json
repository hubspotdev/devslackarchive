    "text": "Hi guys! I have a question about the crm.objects.contacts.write scope, specifically in relation to contact deletion permissions. We have developed an app that does not require permissions to delete contacts at a practical level, but does need permissions to modify the content of certain CRM contact properties. The admin user of our client does not want their HubSpot users to have permissions to delete contacts, which is part of the scope of the app due to crm.objects.contacts.write. However, the app does not delete contacts or need to do so. Is there a workaround for this, or do we need a different scope?",
