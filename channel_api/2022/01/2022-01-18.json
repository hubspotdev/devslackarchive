    "text": "Hi fellow developers,\n\nWe recently migrated our 2600+ pages website to HubSpot. Most of the pages were created through `POST /cms/v3/pages/site-pages`, with parameters for a dozen components in the `widgets` property.\n\nIt all works fine. But now, at a particular spot, 1000+ pages need to have another component rather than the one in the template.\n\n1. If the page has been edited in the CMS editor, then a `GET /cms/v3/pages/site-pages/&lt;id&gt;` returns a fully-fledged `layoutSections`. From that JSON tree, I can edit to whatever I need :tada:\n2. However, if the page is still pristine from import (and most of them are), then `layoutSections` is empty and I'm stuck. I would not like to go down the rabbit hole such as: create another template for this particular use case, assign it to these pages, update the `widgets`, etc.\nI read <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C2YHAHB6K/p1623701945281600?thread_ts=1623701592.280400&amp;cid=C2YHAHB6K|this helpful thread>, but could not find anythng. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/cms/pages|The documentation (esp. the \"Edit Draft\")> is also enlightening, but does not answer this particular issue.\n\n:arrow_right: How to API-trigger the generation of the `layoutSections` for pages where it is empty?\n\nThanks a bunch for reading all!",
