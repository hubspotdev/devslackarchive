    "text": "curious as to what you all do when you have a module that needs something like a checkbox set. I have a repeater of clients, and its items can fall into one or more of five industry areas. Can’t use a Choice field because there could be more than one industry area for a client…. unless i use a choice/boolean field for each area.\n\nthe ultimate intent is to filter on these industry areas, so i would prefer not to let people type things in a text field and risk a typo that skips a client"
