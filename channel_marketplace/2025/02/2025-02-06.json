    "text": "Hello everyone! I am looking for some advice. This is my situation: I have built an OAuth/Public App as I need the app credentials and also the custom timeline event templates functionality.\nHowever, we offer this app/integration to only certain customers who are on specific pricing plans. Meaning that we don't want the app to be listed/published in HubSpot.\nI've just found out that it's possible to get the app listed, but with the \"Contact Us\" type of plan. That would be ideal if this prevents people from installing the app, is this the right approach in this case?",

That's why we need the Auth portion in place/configured and the same as the Timeline Event Templates.\nWe offer the HubSpot integration with a 3rd party provider, which requires this app information, and the connection is configured within this provider as well."
