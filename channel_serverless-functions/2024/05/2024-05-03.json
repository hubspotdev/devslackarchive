I wanted to know the difference. In the end, I'll need the serverless function I'll create for a layer of an external API call with an API key that I don't want to expose.",

    "text": "Hey all, couldn't see a dedicated channel for this but probably the closet thing to my question. I've been working with <https://app.HubSpot.com/docs/23254724/guides/crm/ui-extensions/quickstart|UI extensions> and have two <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/ui-extensions-overview#:~:text=A%20UI%20extension%20is%20built,customized%20through%20their%20included%20fields.|serverless> functions set up. They both require some common functions from a utils folder. When I am developing this locally all seems to work perfectly fine, however when I deploy the extension I'm getting errors in the logs saying it can't find the module. I've put some screenshots below of my deployment and the error message. So wondering if it's possible to have a folder structure like the below deployed for these or if all of the logic needs to reside directly in the serverless function? I couldn't find any examples of this kind of thing <https://github.com/HubSpot/ui-extensions-examples|here>, so leaning towards it not being possible but just thought I'd check in case anyone has come across this before. Cheers :slightly_smiling_face:\n```response from get-fields: {\"status\":\"ERROR\",\"message\":\"[runServerlessFunction]: The serverless function 'get-fields' failed to execute: Cannot find module './utils/getParams.js'\\nRequire stack:\\n- /var/task/test.js\\n- /var/task/HubSpotHandler.js\\n- /var/runtime/index.mjs.\"} ```",
