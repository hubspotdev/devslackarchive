    "text": ":rotating_light: The HubSpot Export API Allows for the Export/Reading of everyone single object type (140+) :rotating_light:\n\nThe HubSpot object API currently allows you to read certain object types `[CONTACT, COMPANY, DEAL, TICKET, PRODUCT, QUOTE, LINE_ITEM, FEEDBACK_SUBMISSION, NOTE, MEETING_EVENT, CALL, EMAIL, TASK, COMMUNICATION, ENGAGEMENT, QUOTE_TEMPLATE, TAX, DISCOUNT, FEE, COMMERCE_PAYMENT, POSTAL_MAIL, ORDER, GOAL_TARGET, CART].`  (There's a couple towards the back of this list that will give you an idea about the possible future of HubSpot) Which is a massive bummer if you need to do a portal migration or if you need to build a (non HubSpot) report on a unsupported object. Say for example you want to pull all the sequences and all the related data for sequences (open rate, clicks, etc) from HubSpot, well until this discovery you couldn't. But now you can get all this data (every object and all the data from every object) out of HubSpot using the exports api.\n\nExample using sequences:\nPOST\n`<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/exports/export/async>`\nBody:\n```{\n  \"exportType\": \"VIEW\",\n  \"format\": \"XLSX\",\n  \"exportName\": \"Sequences\",\n  \"objectProperties\": [\n    \"hs_bounce_count\",\n    \"hs_click_count\",\n    \"hs_completion_count\",\n    \"hs_created_by_user_id\",\n    \"hs_createdate\",\n    \"hs_enrollment_count\",\n    \"hs_error_count\",\n    \"hs_folder_id\",\n    \"hs_lastmodifieddate\",\n    \"hs_meeting_booked_count\",\n    \"hs_merged_object_ids\",\n    \"hs_object_id\",\n    \"hs_open_count\",\n    \"hs_read_only\",\n    \"hs_reply_count\",\n    \"hs_sequence_id\",\n    \"hs_sequence_name\",\n    \"hs_sequence_step_executed_count\",\n    \"hs_unenroll_count\",\n    \"hs_unique_creation_key\",\n    \"hs_unsubscribed_count\"\n    \n  ],\n  \"objectType\": \"0-58\",\n  \"associatedObjectType\":\"0-59\",\n  \"language\": \"EN\",\n  \"publicCrmSearchRequest\": {\n  }\n}```\nThis will create an export of all the sequences in your portal and all the related data for those sequences (also the associated Sequence Enrollments (HubSpot creates an object every time you enroll a contact in a sequence), that's the 0-59). You can then use this data however you like. To pull properties for use in export requests you can use this endpoint: `<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/schemas/0-58>`  or the `<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/0-58/properties>` endpoint (although this one sometimes blocks you) (the 0-58 in this and the request above is the object type id (sequences in this case), DM me if you want a complete list (HubSpot asked me not to share this publicly))\n\nIt is possible that this ability to export system data is a bug on HubSpot’s side, but until it is patched, the HubSpot Export API remains a powerful tool. (@HubSpot if this is a bug please just DM me about the bounty)",
