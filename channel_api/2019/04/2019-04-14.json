    "text": "Hey <@UH52DMK3Q> Very strange.  I assume you are using this endpoint to update the deals? <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/deals/update_deal>  Do the contacts related to the deal closed automatically transition to “Customer” in the lifecycle stage when you make the API call?  I’ll investigate on Tuesday (we are closed Monday for the Boston Marathon).   It’s possible the campaigns tool is taking a shortcut via the UI rather than reading off the source deal data directly, but I’ll confirm after I check back with the engineering team."

    "text": "Hi <@UFBNA9K9A> Thanks for looking into this. I've raised a ticket in the account too and I've just DM'd you an example deal that has been set to won through the API.\n\nWe're using a third party app (Cdata) as the sync tool but I've looked through the data returned via the API in Postman and can't see anything wrong with the deals that have been updated.\n\nIn fact, I've returned all the deal properties after closing the deal through the API (where it is not attributed to the campaign), and then opening and closing the deal through the UI (where it is now attributed to the campaign). I then diff'd the results. And they were the same (except for the timestamp on pipeline stage).\n\nSeems a bit strange. I'll DM you an account and deal ID so that perhaps you can take a look / forward to the engineering team."
