    "text": "Posting this in here as well as <#CJ5DN6RKP|email-development> because it is HubL related :sweat_smile:\n\nHello! I am looking to better understand what might be going wrong with the module I have created for line-items being inserted into a programmable email.\n\nI have this code that works wonders:\n```{% set line_items = deal['line_items'] %}\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  {% for line_item in line_items %}\n    &lt;li&gt;\n      &lt;h4&gt;{{ line_item['name'] }}&lt;/h4&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Quantity: {{ line_item['quantity'] }}&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Price: {{ line_item['price'] }}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n  {% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;```\nBut when I try to add something that will multiply the quantity by the price in order to get the _total_ it makes the template in-usable. I was using something like this:\n```&lt;p&gt;Total: ${{ line_item['quantity'] * line_item['price'] }}&lt;/p&gt;```\nHowever this seems to be the issue. Any time I try to get the module to do math on the values.",
