    "text": "Hi, I’m using the new Node client 10.2 in local and calling:\n\n```HubSpotClient.crm.lists.membershipsApi```\nWorks like a charm, but then when I try to use it in a code block in a workflow this crm.lists.membership is not available, I gt this error:\n```ERROR\tUnhandled Promise Rejection \t{\"errorType\":\"Runtime.UnhandledPromiseRejection\",\"errorMessage\":\"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'membershipsApi')\",\"reason\":{\"errorType\":\"TypeError\",\"errorMessage\":\"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'membershipsApi')\",....```\nIt looks like deployed client version in workflows is 10 but not the last minor release 10.2 which includes the crm.lists new API. Could someone confirm it please? Thanks\n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Node-Client-version-10-in-Workflows-has-not-crm-lists-available/m-p/898055#M69955|Community Thread Issue>"
