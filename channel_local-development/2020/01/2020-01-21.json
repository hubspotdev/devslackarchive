If I try to serve it locally, I see not-rendered HTML (as if the Hubl processor doesn't works).\nWhen I try to upload these to next-to-production test account - I have problem with JSONs files upload (same issue with CLI and FTP).\nI think here is a key - maybe generated modules with JSON files are dependent to the mother-account, where they are generated was.\n\nDo you know another way to making a changes of production pages not on the production (only for tests pourposes)?"
