New here and still learning the basics, but wondered if anyone might be able to help troubleshoot an error I've been facing when attempting to configure a *deal* *tab* *CRM* *card* using `CrmAssociationPropertyList` to show its associated Line Items (with end goal of being able to amend Line Item properties from within it).\n\nI keep being faced with the following error, and the Log Output saying \"Unable to initialize extension\". Any ideas on why this error might be showing would be hugely appreciated!",
