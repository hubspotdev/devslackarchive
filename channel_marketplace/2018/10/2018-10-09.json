BUT, at this moment in time... we're far from that right now. I'd estimate 7-10 business days.\n\nThe reason there is a delay is because we manually check every single item submitted to the marketplace (check it meets guidelines, try to break it, stress test it, make sure it's marketer friendly,etc). This is a very manual process, however, it ensures we hold a high standard of good quality items in the marketplace.\n\nI know we've been getting a flood of new submissions since opening the marketplace to offer Custom Modules -and- as Jon mentioned above, the manager was out of office for INBOUND and then his wedding+honeymoon. So there's a bit more of a delay right now. Appreciate your patience!! :pray:"
