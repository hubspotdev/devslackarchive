    "text": "&gt;  But if you put in a 30 second wait, don’t they all delay in parallel?\nYou might get better behavior with a random component in the wait time, so that stochastically the calls _roughly_ obey the rate limit.\n\nNapkin math: If your burst limit is 150 calls per ten seconds and you have 4k companies to update, those calls have to be spread over 27 ten-second intervals (approx 5 minutes).\n\nIf you randomly assign each call a delay 0 ≤ t ≤ 270 seconds, most of the calls should succeed on their first go."
