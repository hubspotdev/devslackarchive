My picture is 520 x 404 px, but when uploaded to HubSpot the dimensions indicate 78 x 60 px.\nI tried to narrow down the issue and found out that if I change the shadow of my rectangle from 20px to 10px I get the correct dimensions on HubSpot. So any images I create in Sketch that has a rectangle with a 20px (or bigger) shadow, and that is exported as SVG (optimized or not) gives 78 x 60 px dimensions in HubSpot… Did anyone ran into a similar issue?",
