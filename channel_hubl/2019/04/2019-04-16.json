    "text": "I'm working on a blog template that would allow the publisher to show an image gallery module on a per post basis. In the head of the template I've placed this code:\n\n {% boolean \"gallery_toggle\" label='Show Image Gallery', value=False, no_wrapper=True, export_to_template_context=True %}\n\nThe template had an existing HubSpot Image Gallery module. I added this wrapper to the module:\n\n{% if widget_data.gallery_toggle.value == true %}\n&lt;!-- HTML to show when checked --&gt;\n{{ html }}\n{% else %}\n\n{% endif %}\n\nThe code works to show or hide the image gallery. The issue I'm facing is that the images already added disappear! I've reached out to the HubSpot support team and they recommended I post my issue here to see if anybody has seen this bug or has a solution.",
