I am facing few issues while using multiple forms in my template...I have created Layouts of mega menu in a global module where I have given choices to show form,image and menu-links. If i choose form in the first layout and try choosing form in the second layout also...The first form gets loaded not the second one..The second one has the same id as that of the first one..hence creating an empty div..I have attached screenshots of it for your reference....Can you please check?",
