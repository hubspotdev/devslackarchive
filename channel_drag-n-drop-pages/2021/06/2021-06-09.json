    "text": "Hi All.\nWhen using the drag and drop section, if I drag a module onto the page and drop it to the bottom of another section, it creates a new section and adds the module.\n\nIf I then delete that module, it leaves a place holder saying \"Drop Module Here\".\n\nFor the life of me, I can't work out how to get rid of unwanted Columns and Sections.\n\nLooking at the post above, they have a \"Section\" drop down with the option to Delete section. I don't have this feature. How do I enable it OR how do I delete an unwanted section in a DND area?\n\nAll help appreciated. TIA!",
