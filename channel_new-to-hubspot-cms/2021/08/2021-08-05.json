Navigated via browser to the install URL, selected from my list of HubSpot accounts that our company is managing, selected an account and authorized the app.\n\nAt least, that’s what it looked like was happening.\n\nWhat I’m confused about is where in the client’s hub that I used to authorize the app do I see any evidence that occurred? My app isn’t showing up in the ‘Connected Apps’ list. This has been true in three portals where I’ve installed the app. The app works, because I have increased scope access via API, but I can see no evidence of the app install.\n\nThoughts?"
