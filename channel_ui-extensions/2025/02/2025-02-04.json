    "text": "Hi there!\n\nHas anyone used the HubSpot Dropdown component in their UI Extensions app and used the dropdown options to open a Modal?\n\nThe Button components have an `overlay` class, but the dropdown options only work with `onClick` . I'm wondering if I can use a dropdown to have multiple options that open different models. I tried regular React state management but that didn't seem to work.\n\nThanks in advance!",

But you can open an overlay using a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/reference/ui-components/standard-components/button-row|ButtonRow>. The ButtonRow can collapse on smaller screen sizes to give the effect of a Dropdown. Hope that helps!"
