    "text": "Hi Everyone,\nI'm new to HubSpot development and have a couple questions regarding Dynamic pages and CRM tables.\n\nPreviously I've created a couple of dynamic pages using data from tables in the HubDB. This time I want to use our CRM Company table to create a dynamic page. I'm running into an issue though. In the page settings, when selecting the Data Source, it's telling me the page needs to be private if I am to use the Company table. Looks like this is the case for some of the CRM tables, not all.  I couldn't find a way to edit the CRM Company settings to allow public access.\n\nThe page I am creating is a Company directory for the site, and I don't want these pages as private (accessible by password or account registration only), I want these pages to be publicly accessible.\n\nWhat is the best approach? Can I make this table publicly accessible? Should I create a custom CRM table and make it public to use instead. Should I create a HubDB table, and  somehow sync data from the CRM table to it? I'm hoping to use the HubSpot dynamic page setup like I did previously. In this situation, do I need to code it out more manually using the CRM API? All suggestions/help is appreciated. Thanks! :slightly_smiling_face:"
