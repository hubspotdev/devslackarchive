The integration was successfully completed, and I have attached the relevant snapshots for your reference.\n\nHowever, when I try to submit a review on the HubSpot Marketplace, I am prompted with *\"Which account would you like to continue with?\"* or sometimes *\"Create a new account\"* instead of being redirected to the review panel.\n\nCould you please look into this issue and let me know how I can proceed with submitting the review?\n\nIf any one have any idea of this error, please let me."
