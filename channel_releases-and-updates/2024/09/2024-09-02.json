It'd be so helpful to track specific parts of the HubSpot. For example, as a CMS developer, I'm interested in changes to the CMS a lot and would monitor them closely. But something that is related to workflows or CRM would be a lower priority for me.\n\nIs there a way to track the changes from HubSpot team by hubs or anything else?",
