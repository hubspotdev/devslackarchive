    "text": "A bunch of my templates had been disconnected from the pages in my test portal... not sure exactly how that happened, but I've been pushing it pretty hard testing with API's and local dev in terms of moving/renaming/deleting/undeleting files.  A handful of the pages that have DnD templates were disconnected, causing an API script I was working on yesterday to not work, and thus me to beat head against wall. I was assuming everything was fine on the HS side because the page looked fine.  But I finally clicked into the page settings and `edit template` which revealed the connection was broken.  It's good the page is cached in case something like that happens in production, but it would be super cool there was some sort of an indication on the dev side. Might not be a problem for a lot of users, but might become more common as people are pushing local dev."
