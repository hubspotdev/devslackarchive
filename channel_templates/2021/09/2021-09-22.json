When I apply the new template to the blog post, this module behaves as if no content was added to it.\n \nThe blog keeps the images and copy that was there with the prior template change but erases the content that was in this module. The module is also custom. \n \nIf I switch back to the old template, the module shows that it has the content within it again. \n\nAny ideas?",
