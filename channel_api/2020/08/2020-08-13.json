When someone translates a form ...does HubSpot create an additional form completely separated from the one in the original language? or is there a connection between both?\nFor exemple for the translated one I can't see any connection to the one in the original language. Am I wrong?\nI would like to grab all the forms from the api and save the ids in an external DB."
