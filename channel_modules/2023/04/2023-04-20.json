As there are multiple borders shown, it looks like something is rendering, but the actual content has problems. So what i would look for on each element is styles like \"display: none\". Once you found them, you can look through your theme to see where this style is coming from and remove it, or overwrite it with a more specific selector or the use of the !important keyword."
