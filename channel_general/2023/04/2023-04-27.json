I got the embed code from the HubSpot (I have not changed it) and I added to the react component as following:\n\n `const cta = \"&lt;!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --&gt; &lt;span&gt; embed code here&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --&gt;\"  ;`\n\n Then I use dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute on an HTML element to add an CTA HTML string inside its content as follow:\n\n `&lt;div`\n      `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: cta}}`\n`&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`\n\nI can see the CTA button in the page and when I click on it, first it takes me to this url <http://cta-redirect.HubSpot.com|cta-redirect.HubSpot.com>......, then redirect the user to download a file. It seems the user interaction does work fine but there is no things has been tracking in HubSpot Call-to-action page.\n\nI used the call-to-action in our WordPress site and used to work before, now the call-to-action does not work in our WordPress and React sites as well!\n\nI checked the HTML code for both site (WordPress and React app), it seems the call-to-action embed code is rendered successfully.\n\nAny though why the call-to-action does not work? do you think I need to do somethings in HubSpot call-to-action setting?"

    "text": "Hi ALL good morning! Can anyone help me with this problem I am having?\n\nCRM Object Search API can't Paginate Beyond 10k Results\n\nWe're trying to use the CRM Search API to get objects that match a certain filter criteria, but it doesn't work if the 'after' parameter is 10k or more. It appears we can't paginate beyond 10k results using the search API like we can using the list API. So any filter conditions that result in &gt; 10k rows will return an error on the 10,001th row.\n\nSpecifically, we are trying to make a POST call to the /crm/v3/objects/contacts/search endoint, although this probably the behavior for all crm object search APIs.\n\nFor example, take the following request:\n\nPOST <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search>\n{\n   \"limit\": 1\n}\n\nThis successfully returns a single contact, and gives us a total of 133314 rows. We know there is an issue with the 10k boundary because the request succeeds if the after parameter is 0-9999. For example, this request is successful:\n\nPOST <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search>\n{\n   \"after\": 9999,\n   \"limit\": 1\n}\n\nBut this request is not:\n\nPOST <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search>\n{\n   \"after\": 10000,\n   \"limit\": 1\n}\n\nand returns a response w/ the following body:\n\n{\n   \"status\": \"error\",\n   \"message\": \"There was a problem with the request.\",\n   \"correlationId\": \"d94af07c-61a1-44f7-aa67-1ab2867a2377\"\n}\n\nNote that this behavior persists regardless of the filters on the request, so I have left those out.",
