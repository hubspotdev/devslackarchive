They want to see how feasible it would be to create a membership portal for events in HS.\n\nCriteria:\n\n• On login there is a homepage/dashboard that can pull up event information specific to the user\n• An event progression bar that tracks the status of what forms/details the user has completed\n• A bunch of content pages with navigation \n• Each user’s information is private and only accessible via that login\nWould this level of platform be possible?",
