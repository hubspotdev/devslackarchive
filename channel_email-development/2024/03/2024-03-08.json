    "text": "Hi guys, i just joined the community, im lucky it exists. I've been working on a module for an email template. What I want is that when i load 2 or 3 products in a row, in the mobile view it does not scroll down but rather maintains the structure. Apparently i managed to do it, but when i try it in an email it is completely distorted and does not take the styles.\n\nI will attach an image, please if someone has achieved it, I could use a little help :slightly_smiling_face:\nOne of the images is from the design tool and the other is in the preview of the email in which it is clearly seen that the CSS styles are lost and even in the test email that I sent, the products do not even appear next to it.",
