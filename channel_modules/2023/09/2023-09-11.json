I have a tip for yall.\n\nDon't you hate it when you're coding a custom module and the site's theme doesn't apply to your module?\n\nThere's a simple workaround: Inspect any page on your site and copy the  &lt;link&gt; tag for your main.min.css file. Then paste it into your module's HTML and bam! Your module now has the site's styling applied.\n\n(SEO: module style not showing, preview module style, module css theme not working)",
