All controls within a given `fieldset` are then related. The first element inside the `fieldset` must be a `legend` element, which provides a label or description for the group._"

    "text": "Hey there <@UDJV5B73R>, work is ongoing on an update to our forms that will make them more accessibility compliant. Changing the live forms on thousands of websites which could have CSS or JS dependent on the current way they work could break a lot of websites.\n\nTo prevent that issue the new forms will require a new embed code, as such the team is working hard to make sure they get everything solid.\n\nIf you use the form share pages, and iframes used for form styling presets you’ll find they contain many of the updates that solve the issues you reported. The team started with those versions of the forms as they can continuously iterate without worrying about non-HubSpot developer code being impacted.\n\nI don’t have an ETA on when the new embed code will be released but the team is working very hard and is being very thoughtful in how they approach it."
