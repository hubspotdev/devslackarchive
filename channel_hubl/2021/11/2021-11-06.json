I would likely build it this way.\n\nIf it’s a partial you could use a menu tag and set it that way but its kind of a more confusing UX experience for content editors.\n\nOr if it’s a partial you would want to make it a global partial and then you could make a smaller menu module that just gets reused as mentioned in your image and above, as needed."
