    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI need to send some emails programmatically inside my client app using HubSpot <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/email/transactional_email/single-send-overview?_ga=2.265880271.1167607153.1603096077-341660434.1601888010&amp;_gac=1.204081444.1601889195.EAIaIQobChMIoofno9zc4AIVC7XACh20ZAWxEAAYASAAEgKOSfD_BwE|Single-Send API>. On the doc it mentions we need <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/email/how-to-use-transactional-email-in-HubSpot|Transactional addon> enabled in order to use this  API.\n\nI don't believe my client which is a marketing starter account has it by default - but :\n\n1. I couldn't confirm it (I do believe this should be one of the subscription type of the email option) - but not sure\n2. How much would it cost to have this add on enabled ?\n3. Are there any other alternatives to send HubSpot emails programmatically with a marketing starter account ? (I mean aside from enabling workflow which is an option too expensive for now) \nthanks in advance",
