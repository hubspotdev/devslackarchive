    "text": "Hi everyone! I having some issues with the design manager that I’m not sure how to solve. Basically, after making changes to my template, I press the publish changes button, but it shows me that it has errors and doesn’t allow me to save it. And on the error console, don’t shows what is the error, just *Error: Cannot resolve property.*\n\nAny clue how I can check the error for real and them fix to save? I’m using Clean 6…Actually I used many times the theme, and never happens this. Now I updated for the 6.1 and I can not work on the customizations because of this.\n\nThanks!  cc/ <@UA5DFM7CK>",
