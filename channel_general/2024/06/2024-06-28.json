We hope you get a chance to relax and restore yourselves this summer! \n\nWe’ll be back and raring to go on July 8th :) :palm_tree: :sprocket-dance:\n\n\n",

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.
