    "text": "Hey!\n\nWe are facing an issue when we create a new contact and a new deal through Zapier, it shows the original source in the contact card as \"Offline source\". (Calendly)\n\nIn case someone arrived through Google, Facebook, Instagram or other channels it shows the source which is great but in this case we are loosing the original source that super critical for us to measure from where the lead has arrived.\n\nWe talked with HS support and they were explaining that we need to have some code that will solve this issue.\n\nHave you ever heard about it? Do you think that you have the solution to solve it? (It is belong to Zapier &lt;&gt; HubSpot API)\n\nWe would love to know more than that so we would be able have like a tracking script which track how the contacts were created.\n\nKindly, let me know if anyone knows how to assist!"
