    "text": "\"you will need to create alias css classes for the grid classes used by the drag and drop areas.\"\n\nAnd it's simple. You have to install the bootstrap npm package, you insert bootstrap in your stylesheet (`@import \"nodes_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\"), and then  you just add those lines (do not add HubSpot _layout.css file in your html template):\n\n```.row-fluid {\n  @extend .container-fluid;\n\n  @for $i from 1 through $grid-columns {\n    .span#{$i} {\n      @extend .col-12;\n    }\n  }\n\n  @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {\n    @for $i from 1 through $grid-columns {\n      .span#{$i} {\n        @extend .col-md-#{$i};\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}```\nYou add any breakpoints you want."
