I have successfully created a serverless function to get information about employees. I manage to get the data in console, but we would like to iterate through the employees-data and display it in a list in html (in custom module). Is it possible to get the data in a `hubl` variable, and do a hubl for loop? In that case, how? Or do you recommend any other ways of displaying the data from the API in a custom module?",
