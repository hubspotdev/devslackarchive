    "text": "I apologize if this has already been answered, but I am having an issue with creating a private app and developing it locally using react JS. I am trying to make some API calls, but I am getting an error saying `any of the listed authentication credentials are missing` with a list of credentials. I have my call set up with the correct authentication, and the call works in postman fine, any insight into resolving this? The list of missing credentials is as follows:\n\n```service-to-service\": \"service-to-service not engaged. Metadata for service-to-service request not found.\",\n\"hapikey\": \"hapikey not engaged. hapikey is not present in query params.\",\n\"oauth-token\": \"oauth-token not engaged. OAuth access token not found in request header.\",\n\"vendorkey-gae\": \"vendorkey-gae not engaged. Vendorkey not found in request headers.\",\n\"internal-cookie\": \"internal-cookie not engaged. Cookie not found in the request.\",\n\"app-cookie\": \"app-cookie not engaged. App cookie is not present on the request.\"```"
