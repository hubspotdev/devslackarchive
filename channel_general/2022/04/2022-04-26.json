I’m not sure how that would be called - probably Vendor Price list. As example, if the product A in list A would cost 5$. Then the product A would cost in list B 7$. But the products are exactly the same. It’s more for wholesales or different sales channels. Would something like that be possible and to change it on the quotes? Thx, Thomas."

In future number of publications will grow to more than 30. So technically having a different brand account is not financially sustainable (because of $1000/month is so expensive)\n\nSo Questions are:\n• Can we have more than one custom domain in one single account? If Yes, is there any limit?\n• Can we have more than one EMAIL domain connected into single account? Because each publication has different website and different domains from where we want to send newsletters emails. \n• If yes, is HubSpot the right choice in this kind of business where we have more than 10 publications and in future it will grow to more than 30 publications ? \nAppreciate your insight and expertise.\n\nTIA.\n~Keyur"
