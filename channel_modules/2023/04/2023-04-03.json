If Firefox is in Standard mode then the CTA-buttons are working.\n\nSo try to test Standard/strict mode in firefox to see if the problem is fixed in Standard mode.",

    "text": "Hi Kam Jin, I think you can achieve this by targeting CSS like -      .module a {\n  _/* Add styles for the link */_\n}\n\n.module a:hover {\n  _/* Add styles for the hover effect */_\n}\n\n.module a.inactive {\n  pointer-events: none;\n  _/* Add styles for the inactive link */_\n} .                                                                                 and also To apply the `inactive` class to the `&lt;a&gt;` tag when it is inactive, you can use JavaScript to add or remove the class based on the link function. for example -                   *var* link = document.querySelector('.module a');\n\n*if* (link.href === '') {\n  link.classList.add('inactive');\n} *else* {\n  link.classList.remove('inactive');\n}"

New to this Slack group and could really use some help with a recent idea I had to improve the BOF LP for our agency's website\n\nEssentially what I want to do is replicate a similar version of the multi-step form found on the landing page for the 2022 U.S. Consumer Trends Report: <https://offers.HubSpot.com/2022-consumer-trends-report-download>",
