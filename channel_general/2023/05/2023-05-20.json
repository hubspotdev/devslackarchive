    "text": "Hello everyone, I have never been involved in development before. Upon a colleague's recommendation, I started learning HubSpot, but I got stuck on the \"CMS for Developers\" course. I decided to create a theme using design tools and I have created the header, footer, and all other elements. However, I'm having trouble creating repetition fields. Does anyone have any tips on how to do it? In my case, the same image and text are repeated 6 times, but I need to display 6 different images and texts. If someone who has already passed the certification has a zip file, could you please send it to me so I can see how it's done? Thank you in advance, everyone.",
