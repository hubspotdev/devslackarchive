If column choice I choose for ‘*Columns for choice label*’ is a `select` field in the HubDB table, the ‘*Default HubDB row*’, will only pull `[object Object]` arrays in, as opposed to the list of options in the select field. I tested it with several other previously published tables, and I get the same result each time.",
