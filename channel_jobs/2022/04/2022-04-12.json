    "text": "*!! THIS ROLE IS NO LONGER OPEN !!*\n*!! THIS ROLE IS NO LONGER OPEN !!*\n\nLooking to hire a consultant that I can reach out to for help troubleshooting any errors or speed bumps I run into while learning HubSpot CMS Development. The learning is in the box HubSpot development, nothing fancy. Already have front end dev experience but now Iâ€™m onboarding into HubSpot. Pay is $50 - $100 an hour. Looking to purchase time in blocks (10 hours for example) and work through those as I need your assistance. I can be very flexible with your time and we can work out very reasonable accommodations for this to work for the both of us. Thank you.\n\n*!! THIS ROLE IS NO LONGER OPEN !!*\n*!!
