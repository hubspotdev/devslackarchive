    "text": "Hi there - I have a client using Quoter currently to create quotes/invoices for clients for 3500 microsft skus- we are wondering if we can replicate this in our product/quote builder in HubSpot? anyone have any ideas for process to solve for this use case/ he'd want to create a \"store\" per customer, publish their specific skus and prices, and allow them to \"order\" which would generate a quote for signature- this # of clients this would be for is about 5-10, so in theory could we import the 3500 skus - then clone then for each \"client\" store to input pricing for them that can live on a landing page they can select/create a quote from OR is there a better way to do this?"
