Do you want to use structured data (HubDB tables, CRM objects) as headless data, or unstructured data (regular drag and drop pages) as headless data?\n\nAlso, how do you want to use the data in an external presentation layer? Do you have a build stage in a JAMstack style style site, or do you want to hit an API from the FE of the presentation layer?"
