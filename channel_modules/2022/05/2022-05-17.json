Essentially, my use-case is as follows:\n\nEveryday I have an email that goes out with curated content from around the web. I do this by using the Zapier Push chrome extension to send posts to an RSS feed that then gets pulled into my email. I want to create a HubSpot blog instead and have that push create a new post on my blog with a synposis of the original and a link to it. I’d have a listing page with upvoting functionality so visitors can vote on their favorites everyday."

If there is then add an upvote. If there isnt create a new row for it and add the first upvote.\n\nThen in your hubl when building the page you will need to query the hubdb table and order the collection of blog posts first on the number of upvotes (if it is in the hubdb table) and then maybe on date or whatever you want if they are not in the table"
