    "text": "Hey Developers!\n\nHubSpot customers with Service Hub and Sales Hub Enterprise can now customize the CRM with the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/query-HubSpot-data-using-graphql|HubSpot GraphQL API> to fetch CRM data and its associations for creating custom cards. This feature enables developers to utilize the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/query-HubSpot-data-using-graphql#use-a-graphql-query-in-an-api-request|GraphQL endpoint>, which reduces the complexity, and multiple API calls it previously took to fetch CRM object data and associations.\n\nDevelopers can also use the <https://app.HubSpot.com/l/graphiql/|GraphiQL explorer UI> to make test calls and assist in writing queries. Currently, the GraphQL functionality supports querying for HubDB, default CRM objects, and custom CRM object data.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\nI look forward to seeing what complex CRM customizations you make with this API!",
