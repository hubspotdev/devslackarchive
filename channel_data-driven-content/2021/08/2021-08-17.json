    "text": "I am trying to use CLI to create a new HubDB, I have fetched a hubdb form another portal with `hs hubdb fetch &lt;tableId&gt; &lt;dest&gt;` which creates the .json file locally, I then try to use that same .json file to create the same HubDB using the file in another portal but when I attempt the `hs hubdb create &lt;src&gt;` I get an error: `A StatusCodeError has occurred. 400 - \"Foreign table id must be defined: {name='foreign_key_tag_name', label=Foreign Key Tag Name, type=FOREIGN_ID, id=0, deleted=false, options=[], foreignTableId0, width=null}\"` I have tried to update the json file to use the other table ID I am referencing for the Foreign table, but it still does not let create the HubDB even when changing those references. I was able to create the Foreign table with no issues, its the HubDB using that Foreign table as a reference, how does one define a foreign table when it is already created as a HubDB?"
