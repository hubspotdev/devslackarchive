    "text": "Hi, I'm having issues with the related blog posts module atm, I seem to have mixed results from this code:\n\n```\n{% set tagNames = content.tag_names %}\n{% related_blog_posts blog_ids=default limit=3, tags=tagNames, no_wrapper=True, post_formatter='blog_post_formatter' %}\n```\n\nI used some of the help from here: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Blog-Website-Page-Publishing/Automatic-Related-Posts-based-on-Blog-Tags/m-p/264130> to get the code looking like it is now but what i see is that, sometimes i will have related posts show, and a lot of the times, only one thing will show or nothing at all. So I wanted to know, surely i should always receive 3 related posts with this code? and only if they have the same tag names will they have higher priority?\n\nNOTE: all my blog posts are in the same blog also"

    "text": "Hi Community,\nAnyone experience this before and aware of a better option?The issue is with a RSS feed.\n\nI have been trying some things out with placing html in the xml-feed for the events of a newsletter. First of all, it doesn't seem to work to put divs etc inside the xml-code since HubSpot automatically put all items from the RSS on a new row in the newsletter. The problem is  RSS feed  gets put on different rows through &lt;table&gt;-tags, so we cannot place the items next to each other this way\n\n<http://cultuurwerkt.wezz.io/feed.html>\n\nAs a last resort it seems I would have to trying to put this code directly in the editor by pasting the HTML-source(Hoping to avoid this option)\n\nIs there anyway to get it to look like this?<http://tinypic.com/r/34fo8s6/9>"
