    "text": "Has anyone experienced an issue with modules within global areas reverting to an older instance (could even be the initial default state) without making changes to the module? Perhaps a change to the page, or perhaps a change to other modules within the global area are triggering it to revert?\n\nWhat I’m seeing is old content showing up on pages, but changes were not made to the module. It appears to be doing it by itself. The example I have is there’s a Hurricane Alert module within a global header. This alert can be toggled on/off with a boolean within the alert module. Out of nowhere, the alert showed up on the site in the global header. I didn’t see any changes to that module in the revisions history. I go back into the module, the alert is toggled off so it should not be showing. So why is it showing? I re-save and the alert disappears. Re-saving appears to be the fix, but it’s happened a handful of times now.\n\nI have not seen this issue happen more than once, so perhaps the re-save fix prevents it from happening again to that specific instance."
