I’m trying to use one of them to run another function within that one, but I’m unsure of the syntax, could someone lend a hand?\n\n```function myFunction(modalid,yourID) {\n     run_other_function_(yourID)();\n}```\n\nits that `run_other_function_(yourID)();` part that I’m struggling to figure out. I thought it was `'run_other_function_'+yourID+'();'`  or something but that doesn’t seem right.",
