Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.

We have a list of students including their first name, last name, DOB, and unique user ID (no email address). When the student registers they will enter their first name, last name, DOB, and ID. We need to match the elements with a list, if they do not match they need to be notified. If they do match, then we pass on the information to a list of validated students. Has anyone ever dealt with a scenario like this and if so how did you solve it?  Feel free to DM me with any solutions or ideas. Thanks!",
