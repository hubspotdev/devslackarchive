    "text": "Hi there, Daniele from Italy :flag-it: here. Hope you are doing fine, and that summer is treating you well!\nWe have built a AI-based tool (called Datumo) for cleaning/filling/enriching data in CRMs. It natively supports HubSpot (of course it was our 1st integration :slightly_smiling_face: ). We are currently in public beta, and shall be launching publicly next month. At the moment we are working hard to improve the product and its usability before going public. Anybody curious/interested who wants to give it a spin and try it out? :pray:  Here is the website :point_right: <https://www.datumo.cloud/>\nThanks in advance - and of course feel free to ask me anything in :thread:  - looking forward to getting your feedback!\n(Of course at the moment the tool is totally free to use, no credit card required, no strings attached - and yes, we delete your data as soon as the computation is over.)",
