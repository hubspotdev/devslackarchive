If you don’t know the Ids of the companies you want, you can use the `HubSpot.crm.companies.getAll()` method (<https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs/blob/master/src/client.ts#L186|source>). This will handle the pagination through the responses for for you. The second method is if you do know the IDs, you can do a batch get `HubSpot.crm.companies.batch.read()` method (<https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs/blob/master/codegen/crm/companies/api/batchApi.ts#L264|source>). `getAll` is the more common solution",

Since if any of the records are rejected, the entire batch is rejected, I have to fix them by hand, whereas if I enter them one-by one, at least the valid records get inserted.",

To be honest we thought it was a UX bug since users installing apps would be immediately redirected, bypassing the app permissions screen, without any indication that the app was already installed. So we skipped the re-auth and added messaging with the delayed redirect. But it sounds like this may have also affected your integrations  :confused:"
