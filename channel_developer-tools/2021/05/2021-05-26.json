    "text": "Hello guys :slightly_smiling_face: I would love to know where you import your libraries. For example, when there's a slider module you are going to use many times within the same template, do you import slick-slider.js inside the module or in the general template?\nTaking into consideration that:\n• If i import it in the template, i won't be able to add the module to another flexible template that doesn't have that library\n• If i import it inside the module, that file can be requested many times in one page and slow its load speed (Google pagespeed insights)\n",
