    "text": "When you create a template, there is the file name \"template-name.html\" and a label in the code \"Template Name\" - but as a marketer, when you choose your child theme and then want to search for a specific template by name by typing in \"Template Name\" it returns no results because the search is accessing the file name. If you type \"template-name\" it will show the template. This seems backwards as marketers don't know what the developer called the file in design tools, only what it is called when looking at the label within the template selector."
