This way you can create a `renderButton(arg)` macro and use it in other modules. But in this case you have to copy/paste the required fields to all the modules you want to use `renderButton` macro in. Is there a way to avoid this copy pasting? If there was a way to define `fields.json` as `fields.js` as a JS module, then we could just import the file and merge it to the `fields.js` of the module we want to add those fields.\n\nExample:\n\n```// Maybe use JS modules\n\nconst buttonFields = require(\"./buttonFields.js\");\n\nmodule.exports = [\n {\n    label: \"Some label\",\n    name: \"some_name\"\n },\n  ...buttonFields, \n];```\n",
