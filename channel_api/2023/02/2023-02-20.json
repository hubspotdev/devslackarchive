See solution in comments.*\n\nHi, I have been stuck on this since Friday and would really appreciate some help!\n\nI am trying to use marketing events with my app. I am able to create the marketing event but when I register a user, I get a “200” status “COMPLETE” but no contact is registered. If the contact does not exist, the contact is created, but not registered to the event.\nI use the two endpoints:\n• `<https://api.hubapi.com/marketing/v3/marketing-events/events>`\n• `<https://api.hubapi.com/marketing/v3/marketing-events/attendance/{externalEventId}/{subscriberState}/email-create?externalAccountId={someId}>`\n Am I missing something? Worth noting is that I am doing this on a test account and I have not implemented the API on my application end described in the docs (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/marketing/marketing-events#endpoint?spec=PATCH-/marketing/v3/marketing-events/events/{externalEventId}>) although it did not seem like a hard requirement.\n\nBest regards,\nPhilip",
