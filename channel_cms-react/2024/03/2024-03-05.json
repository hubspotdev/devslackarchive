We output any deploy errors in the logs from the activity stream page (<https://app.HubSpot.com/developer-projects/&lt;portal_id&gt;/project/&lt;project_name&gt;/activity>); that will show any specific reasons that the platform was unable to deploy\n2. Make sure that auto-deploy is enabled from the settings page (<https://app.HubSpot.com/developer-projects/&lt;portal_id&gt;/project/&lt;project_name&gt;/settings>)"

I'm thinking that maybe my folder setup isn't ideal and HubSpot might not get the correct path (although, it is working when first connecting the project to Github)."
