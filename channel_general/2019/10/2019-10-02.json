    "text": "Hi Community,\nCould some provide more insight here?\nI added the HubSpot tracking code and I am able to pull in form submission from many forms on a website. The problem is some forms are multi-step forms so the HS tracking code creates a contact without collecting all the data. What is the best way to fix this?\nI assume I would have to used the forms api endpoint but not sure how I can use this and at the same time prevent HubSpot from creating contacts via the tracking code for non HS forms......"
