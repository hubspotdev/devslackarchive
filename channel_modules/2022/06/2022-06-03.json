My question is, how do accommodate  for desktop and mobile settings in my CSS?\n\nIn default modules, you can set a margin on desktop, and a separate one for mobile, using the Styles tab alone. How do I mimic that in custom modules?\n\nCurrently - if I set a margin in one breakpoint, it remains the same in the other. No seperation at all.",
