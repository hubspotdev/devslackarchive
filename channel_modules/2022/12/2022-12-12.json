    "text": "Hello, would someone please help me understand the responsive breakpoints better? I have set the mobile breakpoint in my themes.json. However, this alone does not allow editors to set mobile-specific values for module style fields. The DnD containers can be modified. But, I would like to mimic the same behavior default modules have for responsive breakpoints. The <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes/responsive-breakpoints|developer docs> don't mention anything about custom modules.\n\nAm I missing some markup in my module.html that allows editors to set different style field values for mobile and desktop? Or, is this functionality only available for default HubSpot modules and DnD components?\n\nThanks for any insight and help."
