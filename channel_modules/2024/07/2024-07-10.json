The modules have Javascript files attached.\n\nWhen a page loads that uses the module, the Javascript files are loaded in the html of the page like follows:\n\n&lt;script src=\"myscripts.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\nI need to be able to edit this so that it appears as the following:\n\n&lt;script data-ot-ignore src=\"myscripts.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIs there any way to do this? OneTrust is breaking core functionality on my pages and the only way to stop it's autoblock is to add the above parameter to the script tag (as far as I am aware).",
