    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have created a webpage in HubSpot with specific modules, text, and images. Now, I would like to turn this webpage into a reusable template so that my team members can select it when creating new webpages and simply customize the text and images. However, Iâ€™m not sure how to do this.\nI already copy the code of the webpage as a HubL to use it and make a new template, I have now a new template but it have just our header and footer, the main part is empty in preview and live!\n\nCould you please guide me through the steps to convert my existing webpage into a template that can be used for future pages?\n\nThank you for your help!",
