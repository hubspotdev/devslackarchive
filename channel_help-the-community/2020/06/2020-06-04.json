I want to get only contacts who have been modified in the last 7 days.\n\nI am currently trying `{% set daterange = local_dt|unixtimestamp - 604800 %}`  to get the current timestamp minus 7 days\n\nthen my query string looks like this: `set foo = crm_objects(\"contact\", \"limit=3&amp;lastmodifieddate__gte=\"~daterange, \"firstname,lastname,company\")`\n\ndoes anyone have a recommendation for a simpler way to do this?   I believe i might be comparing seconds to milliseconds or an actual date string"
