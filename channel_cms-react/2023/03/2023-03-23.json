Several of you have asked for this, so now after you rebuild and deploy you project you can:\n• Create D&amp;D areas and include JS modules in them via HubL\n• Drag JS modules into D&amp;D areas in the page editor\n• Customize JS module field values in the page editor and press “apply” to see those changes\n:thread:…",

    "text": "Note, there still are a few related issues that I wanted to point out:\n\n• Previous deploys of JS modules show up in the page editor to add (we fixed this before but the problem came back, will fix again)\n• Field updates to JS modules in the page editor require clicking the “Apply” button to refresh the whole preview. We want to improve that but might not get to it for a little while.\n• You may need to remove island ID hardcoding (like this <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-js-building-blocks-hello-world/pull/14|hello world fix>) to fix hydration issues when multiple instances of a module is on the same page\n• In some cases id hardcoding inside islands is still necessary (subtle stuff around React `useId` calls from your/library components inside islands leading to hydration errors) but we’re working on it",
