Hope you’re doing well!\n\nI need your help because I’m blocked trying to build an html email template where I need to filter a Hubdb table using contact properties.\n\nWe have an insurance table with insurance rates by make, model, and state but can't retrieve the a specific MakeModel+State's insurance rate from our HubDB table using the contact's Make/Model/State properties.\n\nWe can pull the rate if we filter using hardcoded values or parameters we set manually, and we see the contact properties have the exact same values, but we can't filter the table using those contact properties.\n\nCould you please help me? Thanks so much!\n",
