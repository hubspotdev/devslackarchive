I created an email HTML + HubL template based on the default settings, added `scaffoldSchemaPath: ./test_content.scaffold_schema.json` to the template annotations (didn't change anything else), but it isn't showing up.  (I also tested creating a landing page HTML template, again only adding to the template annotations and using default settings, and I could see that one under Landing Page: Attributes.)",
