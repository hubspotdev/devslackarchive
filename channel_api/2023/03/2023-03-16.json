I have an app connected to a test portal (it appears among the \"connected apps\" on the HS portal, not in \"private apps\", so I guess it is a public app) where I created an event template directly via the UI, along with some custom tokens.\nNow, if I click on \"test call\" I'm presented with the options OAuth or private app for the access token and I suppose I have to use the former, right? Well, where do I retrieve it? Provided it is really possible to test this endpoint from the doc page linked above. Otherwise, does this require to be implemented at the backend level?",

First, what I’m trying to do is create a timeline event template as described in <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/timeline|this doc>. I created a private app and under ‘Scopes’ I selected a ‘timeline’ permission scope only. I’ve made the POST call to create the timeline event template, but encountered this error message: “”This oauth-token (***-***-******) does not have proper permissions! (requires all of [developers-write])“. However, I could not locate these ‘developers-write’ permissions. Where can I enable that, and if someone can point me to the solution here. Thanks a lot in advance!",
