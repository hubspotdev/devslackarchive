Even the createdate is \"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\". The contact list API (v3) seems not returning these records, but I can get it when specifying the object ID. Could someone explain what are these records?",

    "text": "Hi <@U017T1ADGG0>, one solution is to:\n1. Create a `function` that uses `document.cookie` to return all cookies and decode the cookie string. See this example function below. \n```    function getCookie(cname) {\n          var name = cname + \"=\";\n          var decodedCookie = decodeURIComponent(document.cookie);\n          var ca = decodedCookie.split(';');\n          for (var i = 0; i &lt; ca.length; i++) {\n              var c = ca[i];\n              while (c.charAt(0) == ' ') {\n                  c = c.substring(1);\n              }\n              if (c.indexOf(name) == 0) {\n                  return c.substring(name.length, c.length);\n              }\n          }\n          return \"\";\n      }```\n2. Using a second function, pull out the `HubSpotutk` cookie placed in the user's browser by the HubSpot JavaScript Tracking Code. _Note this example below is using the <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/reports/customize-your-cookie-tracking-settings-and-privacy-policy-alert|HubSpot cookie banner> which is optional._\n``` document.addEventListener('click', function(e) {\n            if (e.target &amp;&amp; e.target.id == 'hs-eu-confirmation-button') {\n                console.log(\"Accepted Cookies\");\n                var cookie = getCookie ('HubSpotutk');\n               document.getElementById(\"cookie\").value=cookie;\n               console.log(cookie);\n            }\n        });```\n"
