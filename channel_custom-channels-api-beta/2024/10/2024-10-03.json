    "text": "Hello everyone, I have a question regarding updating custom-channels and channel-accounts object. When sending a patch request to update either, I noticed that some attributes, e.g. `inboxId` in channel account schema or `channelAccountConnectionRedirectUrl` (when set to null) in custom channel schema doesn't change. Is this expected? Thank you :pray:",
