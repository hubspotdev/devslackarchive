However, instead of being empty, it is displaying the property name as a string, so I can't check if it's empty before displaying it. (ex: if a contact has a company on record, `company.name` is set to whatever that is. If a contact does not have a company on record, `company.name` is set to `COMPANY.NAME`. So, `company.name` is never really empty).\n\nI've resolved it using the below, but it seems really clunky. Is there a better way to handle this logic?\n```{% set companyName = company.name is not equalto 'COMPANY.NAME' ? company.name : '' %}\n{% if companyName|length &gt; 0 %}\n   Your company is {{ companyName }}\n{% endif %}```",
