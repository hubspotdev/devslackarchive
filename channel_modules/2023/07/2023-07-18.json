    "text": "Hello, I would like to create a page in two languages. I have been adding translations to the modules using design tools, but I'm unsure how to create a trigger or action that allows users to see the translated modules. I noticed that I can change the default language of the site, and when I choose Spanish, it shows everything in Spanish by adding \"/es/\" to the link. I tried leaving the page in English and creating a script for Spanish users to add \"/es/\" to the URL to get automatic translation, but I encounter an ERROR 404 when accessing <http://website.com/es/|website.com/es/>. How can I create the translations and use them effectively?",
