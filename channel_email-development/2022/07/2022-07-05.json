When I click view the entire message , the email open in new window. The issue here is drag and drop two column module changes to one column module. Is there any solution for this?",

    "text": "Hi Binod, there is not; this is Google’s way of encouraging emails to stay light and simple and discourage lengthy “newsletter-style” emails. When I run into this issue, I try to refactor my messaging strategy such that the email is more of a “preview” of the newsletter (or whatever the current content is) and direct the user to click a CTA to go to the full version on a landing or web page. This also means you’re avoiding unnecessary cross-client design bug risks, as browsers are much more standardized compared to email clients."
