    "text": "Hi everyone. I built a simple workflow with a webhook that enrolls contacts created before a certain date. I de-activated the re-enrollment, yet I still keep seeing HubSpot POST enrolment request to my webhook URL for the same contacts regularly every 10 or 15 minutes. Does anyone know what causes this automatic re-enrollment behaviour, and where I can be de-activated once and for all? Thanks in advance.",
