    "text": "Hi Laura, curious if your dev is starting from scratch or using a theme? A lot of new to HubSpot from WordPress devs view themes differently, but in HubSpot using a theme as a starting point can save a lot of time and money, doing most of the heavy lifting for you, like animation on scroll, etc."

Do you know if there's certain article or URL which you can direct me to, that shows info about how to _prepare_ a HubSpot website for working on mobile (besides desktop platforms). I wonder if there's certain space dedicated in the Edit interface of a page (or elsewhere), or if you need to end up hardcoding `style` into the HTML of certain widgets. Thanks in advance!",

    "text": "Hi Damien. Are you starting your site using a purchased theme or the HubSpot boilerplate?  Most Marketplace themes are mobile friendly. You can also create a child theme from one purchased in the marketplace.  Many of these themes have a child.css or themeoverrides.css where you can add media queries to handle specific style needs. You can also override a module or template by copying it to the child theme and overriding the standard behavior.\n\nCheck out <https://academy.HubSpot.com/> for great courses on how to work with the HubSpot CMS."
