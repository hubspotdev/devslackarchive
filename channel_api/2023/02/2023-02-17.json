I use API and this approach <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Attaching-files-to-object-via-the-APIs/m-p/727943> however it seems like there is a limit for uploading files into the file manager. I have about 3000 files but I am able to upload max 250 files.\nI have noticed that if I attach an external file to the object manually it doesn't go to file manager but stays attached to the object.  Is there any solution for attaching big amount of files to object record via API?",
