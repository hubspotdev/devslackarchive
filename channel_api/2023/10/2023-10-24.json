In the end per HubSpot support the HubSpot Associations History view on an object page does not present all association types only those that are unlabeled. So our PUT request was replacing all the existing associations between contact and company but thereâ€™s no record of it in the history because the association was labeled. Once the primary company to contact association was deleted and replaced, there was no company to meeting association."

I'm using the /email/public/v1/campaigns/ endpoint with no query parameters besides the offset used for pagination. According to a conversation I had with support, automated emails are not excluded from said endpoint, so my last resort is to ask here. Is there anything specific I need to do to get those automated/workflow emails that's not listed in the docs?"
