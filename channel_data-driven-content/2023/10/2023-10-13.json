Now we can have a separate content page with the slug ending `[:dynamic-slug]`  and since this is a separate content page, you can edit in the editor as if its a regular page if you want to add some static modules.\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/use-graphql-data-in-your-website-pages#create-dynamic-pages-using-query-data>\n\n<@U6W3H6YN8> <@U024L8W0MB6> Correct me if I am wrong here."

Still something to be desired from an editing experience, but might be better than what you have today.\n\nIf you want to talk more about this idea, feel free to book me here.",
