    "text": "Hey there <@U018FJJB2PL>, we actually encourage if youâ€™d like to use jQuery that you use require_js or a linked JavaScript file.\n\nEnabling it under website page settings causes it to load across every page on a domain.\n\nLoading at the module level  enables you to conditionally load jQuery only in the modules and pages that need it.\n\nThe other advantage is that the website page settings jQuery is an older version of jQuery. It is recommended to use the latest version for new projects, and that can only be done by linked javascript files or require_js"
