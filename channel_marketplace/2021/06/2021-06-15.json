We are having some issues uploading a Theme in the marketplace, the Theme listing name is taking the name of the folder where the theme is instead of the label on the `theme.json` . Is there a way to change the Theme listing name without changing the folder name? We want to keep it lowercase and without spaces. Thanks!",
