I've been having an issue with the API (in this instance, the v3 company endpoint) where we're not receiving the most up-to-date values for entries.\n\nExample:\nWe created a company called _ABC123_ in 2019 with the country _Japan_. We then subsequently changed the country manually in the HubSpot console to _United States_ and finally to _USA_. But when I make my API call, I'm *still receiving Japan as a result*\n\nAny ideas?",
