    "text": "Hi folks! This is feedback for HubSpot. You have this great documentation of making themes. There is file called fields.json and its documentation (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes#fields-json>). I think your example is missing brackets `[…]` and it is not working right now. Should it be like this maybe?\n\n```[{\n   \"type\": \"group\",\n   \"name\": \"typography\",\n   \"label\": \"Typography\",\n   \"children\": [\n     {\n       \"type\": \"font\",\n       \"name\": \"h1_font\",\n       \"label\": \"Heading 1\",\n       \"load_external_fonts\": true,\n       \"default\": {\n         \"color\": \"#000\",\n         \"font\": \"Merriweather\",\n         \"font_set\": \"GOOGLE\",\n         \"variant\": \"700\",\n         \"size\": \"48\"\n       }\n     }\n  ]\n}]```\nThere were feedback bubble earlier but I can’t see it right now, so I’ll post this here.",
