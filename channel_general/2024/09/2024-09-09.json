We are hoping to utilize an SMS app that unfortunately does have a native HubSpot integration. I am hoping that since this SMS app offers an open API that we can still send some information automatically from the SMS app to the activity log on the customer profile, or create a section on the customer profile for the SMS activity log.\n\nIf anyone here can help, please comment on this post. I am willing to pay for assistance within reason and can provide any context needed for the connections. Thank you",
