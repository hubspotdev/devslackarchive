    "text": "I'm having trouble with the format of the data returned from the HubSpot API.  Using this python script, data is returned - and it looks like JSON: from HubSpot import HubSpot\nimport json\nimport csv\nimport pandas\nfrom pandas import DataFrame\n\napi_client = HubSpot(access_token=\"XXXXXX\")\n\nall_contacts = api_client.crm.contacts.get_all(properties=[\"email\",\"firstname\",\"lastname\",\"adpoint_sync_adpoint_id\"])\n\nprint(all_contacts)But, I can't work with the data.  I've tried dumping it into a JSON file, and I get errors.  I've tried converting it to a string and then to JSON, but can't really work with it.  I've tried dictionaries, data frames, etc.  I either get an error, or I get text output I cannot work with.  Does anyone know what I need to do to use the output?  I'd like to get the properties into a CSV format to insert into a database.",

    "text": "Hi, I am trying to integrate HubSpot with #SAP Open Connectors. For this, I have created a free developer account with HubSpot. The authentication with OAuth2 and defining the scope works fine, I think, because of the trial and error steps I went through following the instruction of this blog: <https://blogs.sap.com/2022/05/12/end-to-end-cloud-integration-using-open-connectors/>\n\nNevertheless, when I try to connect, I get this error message: *Couldn’t complete the connection*\n*The account you selected 1234567890 is a developer account. This app can't be installed on a developer account.* \n\n\n\nSales support told me that the free developer account may be restricted, and I should try the developer community. To me, either I'm missing a small step or this is kind of a chicken and egg problem: a developer account that is so restricted that one cannot try out the API integration. Any ideas? Please help! Thanks!",
