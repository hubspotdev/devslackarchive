    "text": "Hello, has anyone used the `<ToggleGroup>` from the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/ui-extension-components#toggle-group|UI Extensions> component package? Specifically, have you tried to pass a variable (useState) into the value prop to update the selected options reactively?\n\n`const [selected, setSelected] = useState<string[]>([]);`\n`<ToggleGroup value={selected} options={<option_array>} />`\n`<Text>{JSON.stringify(selected)}</Text>`\n\nI know the `selected` variable is getting updated because the `<Text>` component reflects the changes on screen. However the `<ToggleGroup>` only takes the initial value and never updates itself afterwards.\n\nAm I missing something obvious?",
