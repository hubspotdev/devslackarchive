How can I achieve this?\n\nCalling `{% module \"module_1234567890\" path=\"/background_Image.module\", export_to_template_context=True %}` does not seem to work, unless I add `src='<http://image.pg|image.pg>',` which ignores anything going on in the custom module."

We had it working before but now the file structure seemed to have changed today. before it was serving those images under our company domain, but now images uploaded through a HubSpot form are served over <http://api.HubSpot.com/filemanager|api.HubSpot.com/filemanager>. Is there a way to go back to having them served over our domain vs having a redirect serve the image? Its messing up our emails that have an image served through a custom contact property"
