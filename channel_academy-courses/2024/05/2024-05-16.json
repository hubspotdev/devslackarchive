    "text": "Looking for a career change - Curious about being a HubSpot developer\n\nI have a background in Lead Generation. I worked on a Salesforce implementation a long time ago and enjoyed it.\nI'm considering a move out of my current role. I would like to get something that works from home and was looking into getting HubSpot certification.\nFor those of you who do HubSpot development full-time, I have a few questions:\n1. How's that market? How hard is it to find work?\n2. Is remote work readily available?\n3. What's the general starting pay for a developer?\n4. Any advice for someone in my spot? Specific certifications to focus on, etc?\n",
