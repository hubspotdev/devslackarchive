For a login page my end goal is to have when someone logs to WP it checks in HS first to see if the contact exist, check for typos before just creating a contact in HS. Any ideas on the best approach for this?Right now unnecessary contact are getting created in HS....",

    "text": "Hey, <@UEZJ74UN8> :wave: For context on your setup, are you relying on the tracking code to listen for submissions and pass them to non-HubSpot forms (<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/articles/kcs_article/forms/use-non-HubSpot-forms>) or are you actively creating contacts with either the Forms API or Contacts API?\n\nI’d recommend using either the Forms API or Contacts API to create contacts.\n\nOnce you receive the email, you can make a server-side call to the _Search for a contact by email address_ endpoint (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/get_contact_by_email>) to check whether a contact exists with that email address. If you don’t receive a response, you can let the contact creation proceed.\n\nAll this said, can you give me a sense of what an “unnecessary” contact looks like? Obviously, HubSpot de-duplicates by email address, so we shouldn’t be creating duplicate contacts unless the email used is different or misspelled."
