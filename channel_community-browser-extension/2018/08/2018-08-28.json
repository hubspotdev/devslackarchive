    "text": "We’ve hit 230 users of the chrome extension! Woo!\nI will be at <#CBF8XQ57U|> this year, and will be doing a booth at the Developer Science Fair on partner day(Tue, Sep. 4th). Come find me I plan to have a free something for extension users who visit. [Keep your expectations low and you won’t be disappointed lol]. We don’t make money off the extension so this is coming out of my own pocket.\n\nUpdate - the free something may not be happening now I’m afraid I’m still working on it but Monday being Labor Day has made this significantly harder to get vendors to produce what i need in time. I likely won’t know until Tuesday morning the outcome. Fingers crossed, if anyone has ties to a Boston based printing company please DM me."
