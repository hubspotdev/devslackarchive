    "text": "Yeah so that's pretty close, basically webhooks are just like bullets in a gun, (quote button = gun/trigger, zapier = target) when you click the button on the quote it will fire off a webhook and send it to zapier. Zapier can then use that information in the webhook (I would send the deal id through as a query parameter in the url) to run some automations on the deal (mark as closed, send email to owner). This is a really great video explanation: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A54_9nsyc8>"
