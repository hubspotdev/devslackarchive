On the blog, I can only upload one featured image in one size, which can be linked to the blog post as publicly available attribute that I can via custom module in the regular page. HubSpot will not resize the uploaded images and provide smaller versions of it, so if I need some big hero images to be used as a background for a hero section on the blog page, I have to upload it in high resolution, meaning that when I render the list of blog posts on the index page (for example), there are no smaller thumbnail I could use and I have to render full-size images, meaning significantly increase loading time of the site, right?",
