    "text": "Good morning team!\nI am posting here on behalf of our company named Newsletter Glue. We have a newsletter plugin which has already integrated many popular email service providers like Mailchimp, MailerLite, AWeber etc. Our customer install the plugin in their WordPress website and connect with their email service providers. Our plugin offer lots of features like customer can collect their subscribers using our plugin, they can write article in their website but it will be automatically converted in custom email then they can broadcast it to their lists/segments of subscribers. Everything is working using REST API of email service provider. As we have seen HubSpot is most popular and useful in this era, we want to integrate the HubSpot in our system too and we believe that will be more helpful for HubSpot customers. In the mean time, after doing some R&amp;D on HubSpot's API documentation, I could not find any email broadcasting API that sends custom email to a group of contacts. Do you have this type of API already exist or have any plan to create in future? Please let me know. Thank you.",
