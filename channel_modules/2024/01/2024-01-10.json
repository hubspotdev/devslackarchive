    "text": "Hello! I have a setup in with staging and production theme. Production pages use production theme and pages in development use staging theme. Reason for this is that themes (and the pages) contain custom modules that I’d like to be able to work on without messing up the production website. Once I’m happy with module changes I “push” changes to Github, which in turn applies the changes to production theme via Github Actions. This works fine - except for the modules added via DND page editor. When I switch the page’s theme from Staging to Production, page keeps referencing the Staging theme modules - so not good. Any way around this?",

    "text": "Hi all, anyone familiar with how HubSpot deals with possibly missing values?\n\nI have code like\n\n```{% for something in module.my_options.my_things %}\n{% unless something is undefined or something is none %}\n  {{something}}\n{% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}```\nbut the output I get is\n\n“null”\n\n(Meaning the `unless` bit thought that `something` was defined and not none. )\n\nI’ve tried using `pprint` to see the iterable `my_things`:\n\n```SizeLimitingPyMap: {something=[67, 77, null]}```\nbut when I do `pprint` on the item itself like “{{something|pprint}}” it comes back as “unknown”.\n\nOne thing that *does* work is doing `{% unless something == \"null\" %}` - if I do that, the `null` value is not printed… but it seems odd that the “is none” check didn’t catch the null value (I guess null is being converted to a string??)"
