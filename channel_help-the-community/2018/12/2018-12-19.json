    "text": "<@UEW3R63D1> like always it depends on the use-case. If you just want it to be a normal external svg, use it like any other image. If you want it embedded inline, I’ve done things like created coded files and hubl included them into templates, that way I get the benefits of an inline svg, and the benefits of just an img tag basically in the template(there isn’t a ton of bloat to sift through)."
