    "text": "Hey all, new developer here trying to follow the UI Extensions Quickstart <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/ui-extensions-quickstart|guide> — I got to the end of step 2, but when I tried to run `hs project upload`  I got an error saying that my `example-card.json`  file “doesn’t match the associated scheme.” I’ve checked against the example files in the documentation <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/create-ui-extensions|here>, and it looks like it matches. Based on the errors, though, it looks like it wants something in this structure in the “data” object.\n```\"fetch\": {\n      \"targetFunction\": \"string\",\n      \"objectTypes\": [{\n        \"name\": \"string\",\n        \"propertiesToSend\": [\"string\"]\n      }]\n    }```\nOnce I made it fit that schema, I was able to upload the project and begin local dev, but the card itself always errors on the CRM record. Has anyone come across this before/any idea where to find documentation on this? Thanks in advance :pray:",

    "text": "Hi Sejal, just installed the CLI earlier today. As for the beta, you’re probably right. I was thinking of experimenting in a developer/test account, but it doesn’t look like I can specifically enable betas (it says I need to be a Super Admin, but I’m the only user &amp; super admin on the account). Since the UI loaded the Custom tab and a custom card in response to my project, I thought they might be on by default. Any insight? Sorry for the noob questions"
