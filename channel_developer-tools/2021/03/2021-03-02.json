I'm more of a designer but have been tasked with the build. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nWe need a form field that requests info from the user, such as First Name, then moves the user to the next field, then the next, one field at time. We don't want the user to see a long form displayed. We want one question/entry at a time, with a progress bar showing percent completion.\n\nIs there a HubSpot tool/module available for this? Or do I need to use something like Typeform? We're trying to imitate what is seen on the Baby Bathwater <https://babybathwater.com/nominate-a-guest/|website>."
