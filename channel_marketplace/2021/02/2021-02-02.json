    "text": "Hello, I'm curious to know if anyone can help point me in the right direction regarding developing a HubSpot App Integration similar to Live Chat. I don't really have a clear understanding of how to begin. I signed up for Developer Account, Created an App but there is no direction of where to go from there. I would like create an Integration similar to Live Chat but the difference is the Chat Client Interface would communicate with our Bot Service via Webhhook API. I'm not clear on the steps to move forward. Can anyone assist?"
