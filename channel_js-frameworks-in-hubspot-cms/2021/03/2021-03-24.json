    "text": "Hello All - We have developed a content driven website using React JS and want to host it in HubSpot. The backend is within HubSpot itself. We were able to deploy the website and able to preview it as well, but it seems as if the routing within React JS is not working correctly due to which we are only able to see certain parts of the website and not the whole website. We have utilised the boilerplate that is provided on the HubSpot site for this. We are badly stuck as we were under and impression that migrating a site to HubSpot would be without glitches. Any urgent help will be highly appreciated."

We were able to deploy the website and able to preview it as well, but it seems as if the routing within React JS is not working correctly due to which we are only able to see certain parts of the website and not the whole website. For e.g. we are only seeing the header and the footer not the body. Even the header and the footer are not shown correctly and seems the CSS is not getting applied correctly. We have utilised the boilerplate that is provided on the HubSpot site for this.  Any urgent help will be highly appreciated."
