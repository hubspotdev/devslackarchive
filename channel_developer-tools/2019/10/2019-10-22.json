    "text": "As Matt said, nesting modules is not supported, as you wouldn’t have a UI in the page editor for the nested modules.  This would create a poor experience for site maintainers. A developer could work around this by adding fields to the parent module, but that results in a bad experience for the developers. In addition you could unintentionally create infinite loops.\n\nMost of the situations you’d want this for are layout related. To address that we have the drag n drop area tags [currently in public beta] <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tutorials/drag-and-drop-areas>"
