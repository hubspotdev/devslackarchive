I have N amount of contacts coming into HubSpot through contact API daily. I want 80% of these contacts to go into a workflow, 20% into another (or down a different branch).\n\nUnfortunately workflows don't work that way, so need to think of a way to do it outside of HubSpot. Set a contact property to A, unless 5th contact, then set a contact property to B?",

A restart will pick up the deal which caused the crash.\n\nThe script crashed 3 times and we expected to see 3 deals that have duplicates. But, the number of deals which have duplicates are way higher than 3. Looking into each deal, we found that some have 5 copies being created with 1-2 mins in between. However, there always will be only one deal associated products among the duplicated deals.",
