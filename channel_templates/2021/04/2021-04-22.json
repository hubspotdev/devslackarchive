    "text": "Hello, I am trying to correct problems with the files of a template so that they can be minify and optimized automatically by HubSpot. I would like to help with two points:\n\n1) Where can I see all these errors? Sometimes when I open the file, HubSpot shows me the warning as in the image below, but if I write anything on the file they disappear (even if I haven't fixed them). And when I repair one, it indicates that there are no more warnings but after a while it shows another warning (even if I haven't touched anything else).\n\n2) What would be the specific problem in the image below? I didn't understand what's wrong here. Se the code:\n\nOutput:\n```-webkit-transition: background-color .1s 0s ease-in-out, color .1s 0s ease-in-out;\n-moz-transition: background-color .1s 0s ease-in-out, color .1s 0s ease-in-out;\n-o-transition: background-color .1s 0s ease-in-out, color .1s 0s ease-in-out;\n-ms-transition: background-color .1s 0s ease-in-out, color .1s 0s ease-in-out;\ntransition: background-color .1s 0s ease-in-out, color .1s 0s ease-in-out;```\nGenerate from this macro\n```{% macro transition(value) -%} \n    -webkit-transition: {{ value }};\n    -moz-transition: {{ value }};\n    -o-transition: {{ value }};\n    -ms-transition: {{ value }};\n    transition: {{ value }};\n{%- endmacro %} ```\nThanks in advance and I hope this channel is the best place to ask for help.",

    "text": "<@UKEGFH76U> Seems good to me, I can't reproduce your error. You can try to play with the syntax. Use _100ms_ instead of _.1s_ and set the delay to _0_ instead of _0s._ As well try it without delay, the default is zero. And rearrange your values to transition: _property duration function delay_;\n\n`.transition {`\n  `{{ transition('background-color 100ms ease-in-out, color 100ms ease-in-out') }}`\n`}`"
