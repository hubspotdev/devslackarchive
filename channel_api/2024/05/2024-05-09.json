We are seeking assistance with an issue that has arisen following our transition from using Hapikey (v2 version) to a Private App (v3 version) for our API calls. Since making this change, we have encountered a problem with tracking Google and Facebook leads in our HubSpot contacts list.\n\nPreviously, when we used a [specific code], tracking for contacts originating from Google functioned correctly for v2 version. However, after switching to v3 version, the tracking no longer seems to differentiate properly between Google and Facebook leads. Instead, [specific code] appears to aggregate contacts from both sources under a single filter in the HubSpot contacts list, particularly under the \"Original source drill-down 2\" filter option.\n\nCould you please help us resolve this issue so that we can correctly track and differentiate leads coming from Google and Facebook separately as we did before?\n\nThank you in advance for your help and support.",
