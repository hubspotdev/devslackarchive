    "text": "Morning Everyone,\n\nI have a query that I need some help with.\n\nI have made changes to the quotes that it adds 20% VAT automatically on the subtotal of the quote and displays it below the subtotal -&gt; attached screenshot for reference.\n\nSo at the bottom of line items the quote is shows as : Subtotal\n                                                                                            VAT\n                                                                                           Total\n\nHowever, the problem we are facing is that when paying with Stripe, the payment amount is pulled from Subtotal and not the total. Does anyone know where I can make changes so that the payment amount is pulled from the Total.\n\nThank you",
