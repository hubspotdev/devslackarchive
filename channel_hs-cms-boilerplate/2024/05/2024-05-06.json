    "text": "Hi Everyone, I have created a HubSpot form and used it on the website. I have also created a Meeting link with some form fields. When a user fills out the HubSpot form and hits the submit button, the form will be successfully submitted and the Meeting Calendar will open. After that, the user can select the time. Once the user selects the time, the Meeting Calendar form will appear. So, I want the values that the user filled in the first form to automatically fill in the Meeting Calendar form. Is this possible? Thank you"
