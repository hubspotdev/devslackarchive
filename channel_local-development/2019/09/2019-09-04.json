    "text": "I don't think that's something they have quite ready yet... the local server works great for compiling hubl, but I don't know of a way to bring in the surrounding context of the website for an accurate preview of how it will look in the portal.  I believe the best solution right now is to create a dev portal as close to production as possible, and use the local dev tools to work in that.  A few of us have created gulp tasks to make this a pretty smooth process. See <https://github.com/teunrutten/HubSpot-boilerplate> courtesy of <@UGDF9EBPW>"
