    "text": "<@U22PJPGK0> what time was the fix rolled out? i've had problems with JS caching this morning, from 7:30 - 11:30. I had to move my scripts out of the footer of the page and into the &lt;head&gt; section b4 any code that I'd changed showed up. Even then, the (old) presence of the JS in the footer cached for about 20 mins so I had the same scripts duplicated for a while",
