    "text": "I just had a strange thing happen a client was using a js script we built a while back that pulled info from HubDB.\n\nThe issue was when they made a change to a row in HubDB it wasn't reflecting on the front end using: `{% for name in hubdb_table_rows(12345, \"&amp;sub_family__is_null\") %}`\n\nSo after about 30 min of banging my head on the keyboard I added single quotes around the ID and now the results are pulling the latest info:\n`{% for name in hubdb_table_rows('12345', \"&amp;sub_family__is_null\") %}`\n\nAnyone else ever experience this?"
