    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe have created a modules with different fields that act as a settings for our module and then we put a  value on the “template” like\n\n```slider_settings={\n  \"items_to_show_per_slide\": 3\n}```\nbut when we create a page using that template.. the fields are disabled and when we inspect the editor of the page it is showing this error\n\n```Uncaught TypeError: Cannot create property 'items_to_show_per_slide' on string '{\n   \"items_to_show_per_slide\": 3 \n}'```\nso we have tried to make it like this instead without the double quote:\n\n```slider_settings={\n   items_to_show_per_slide: 3\n}```\nand this solves the issue, however we are kind of confused cause on other scenario like this\n\n```style_options={\n      background_color: { \n             \"color\": \"#243241\", \n             \"opacity\": 100 \n       }\n}```\nwhen we create a page with that options declared on the template.. the module is working fine and we are able to edit the options inside the module.\n\nis there a rule in putting a quote on the module field when we are adding a value in the template?"
