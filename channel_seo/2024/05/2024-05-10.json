    "text": "Hi <@U06FY4HGSS1>, I know it's been a few months, but I recorded some thoughts for you here: <https://share.descript.com/view/MnwI0P2pK0u>. You'll need a developer for sure.\n\nI see tons of opportunity for improving performance on your homepage alone.\n\nAs a small starting point, I recommend seeing if you have the ability to lazy load any images found on the homepage that appear below the fold. You may already have that capability within your module's settings without further dev work, and that can have a nice impact. If you don't, some enhancements to those modules would unlock that capability.\n\nAs for a first dev task (of many to follow), I'd probably aim to add `{{ sizeAttrs }}` to the &lt;img&gt;'s in the html of in home-banner-slider.module so images have set width and height. This will help improve CLS and also enable HubSpot's image optimization capabilities can kick in.\n\nExample:\n```&lt;div class=\"img__wrapper\"&gt;\n  {% if module.image.src %}\n    {% set sizeAttrs = 'width=\"{{ module.image.width }}\" height=\"{{ module.image.height }}\"' %}\n    {% if module.image.size_type == 'auto' %}\n      {% set sizeAttrs = 'style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\"' %}\n    {% elif module.image.size_type == 'auto_custom_max' %}\n      {% set sizeAttrs = 'width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" style=\"max-width: {{ module.image.max_width }}px; max-height: {{ module.image.max_height }}px\"' %}\n    {% endif %}\n    &lt;img src=\"{{ module.image.src }}\" alt=\"{{ module.image.alt }}\" {{ sizeAttrs }}&gt;\n  {% endif %}\n&lt;/div&gt;```"
