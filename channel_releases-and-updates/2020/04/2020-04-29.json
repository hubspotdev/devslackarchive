    "text": "*TL;DR  The CMS CLI is replacing FTP*\nFTP is an aging technology from the 1970s that relies on FTP clients we didn’t build. To deliver the best developer experience we can, it doesn’t make sense to continue investing resources in the maintenance of an experience that you’re not satisfied with. Instead, we want to focus on tools that enable you to do your job more effectively and efficiently. We believe that the CMS CLI (Command Line Interface) is one of those tools. FTP support will be sunset on W*ednesday, May 27, 2020*. The CLI supports all of the functionality FTP does and a lot more. We realize that you may not be familiar with command line tools, but we encourage you to give the CMS CLI a try. We built it to be easy to use for developers of all skill levels.\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/cms-cli-replacing-ftp>",
