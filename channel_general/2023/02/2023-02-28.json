In this particular example, all of the existing line items are set to be due at a future date and time.  Since our current system evaluates First Payment as `payment due at checkout` and these items aren't due at checkout, we would expect the returned number to return $0.\n\nThe team is aware that this may cause some confusion for customers and they are working to expand our totals calculations to more appropriately describe payment terms on Quoting. We do appreciate that you've shared this feedback with us and they will keep it top of mind as they continue to evolve this feature set over time."

It's one thing to change things, it's another to make breaking changes ithout notice.\n\nAlthough I fully grok that you can't possibly imagine what myriad combinations of custom templating &amp; coding that people are choosing to use in the quotes product, that just means that quotes needs to be treated like an API and either have versioning so that you can break shit and it doesn't impact anybody on the LTS, or you have to give substantial notice about future changes, deprecations etc.\n\nInstead, it *feels* like HubSpot product is treating quotes like a SaaS product release, which makes sense for products where it's just buttons and clicks and sorting and moving, but the moment that customization and coding come into play, the product is no longer a pure play SaaS and really can't be versioned that way."

Created a Website using a template, created a main navigation, but I can't seem to see where you to make the menu appear on the home page.  If this isn't the right forum for these type of questions, if someone could point me in the right direction that'd be great.  Thanks all.",
