So I tried that method of calling in that CSS file in the &lt;head&gt;, then using a font-family declaration for items using that font. But this method does not work. That font-family declaration I've tried using multiple methods (using single quotes, double quotes, what Adobe says to use, what a HubSpot reference said to use, etc) to no avail. I have not tried just downloading the fonts and uploading into HS yet."
