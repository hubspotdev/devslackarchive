This is a recent issue that seems to have come out of nowhere. Even after removing the cookie banner from the our HubSpot sites/pages, it still appears on PDF version of the estimates. Has anyone faced a similar issue? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!",

    "text": "Probably a bit of a weird question, but does anyone know of a clever way to hide certain functionalities in the HubSpot CRM UI like the 'Sales' tab in the top menu? User permissions do not do the job for us.\nI found that these menu items have a specific ID, so i could hide them using CSS, but I am then looking for a clever way to link the file to the UI that is consequently used by my clients.\n\nBit of background: we work for a semi-governmental institution with a lot of less tech-savvy people. Therefore, I want to hide as much features as possible since they are not supposed to use them anyway.",
