    "text": "I have a email template and a rich text module in it.\nThis module contains placeholder text, and when my API exports an email and its content, it is pulling both the placeholder text and the actual content that has replaced it for that specific email. As you can imagine, this causes confusion since it retrieves two different types of content.\nIs there a way to check how long has the placeholder text been there?\nHow can I identify if there were any other placeholder text before this one?\n\nI want to understand if there is a way to view history for this module in the backend to understand how long this text has been present.\nThis way, our analytics team can set rules to exclude the current placeholder text and any historic ones used for this template"

Each module has its own background color -- here, module 2's background is WHITE, not transparent. or it might be a different shade of blue, gray, etc.\n3. There's an ambient \"wave\" image on top of the background color of each module, but under the content of each module.\n4. There are several wave images to choose from, also they each switch responsively (mobile and desktop versions).\n5. I don't want to build a section for each set of arbitrarily-chosen modules; this could be applied to dozens of combinations.",
