    "text": "Hi,\nIt’s great to this community. I’m new to HubSpot. But I’m facing a issue that I can’t solve. I logged in as a Developer and didn’t go for sending any email. I’m intending to make a new theme so I’ll need to create Website/Landing page with the free tools and CMS account. But it has blocked(screenshot attached). I mailed from the link when the top bar notice had a link to submit a form.\nDo you guys have any idea how long it could take or how I overcome this situation?\nThanks in advance…",
