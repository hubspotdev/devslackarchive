    "text": "I'd personally like to see menu fields get added to Themes.  My specific use case is that sometimes we want a header to be transparent at the top of a few pages on a site, but not globally.  While I can think of a couple ways around this when using a global header module, I think the best end user experience would be to edit that setting in the header module itself.  While yes, the menu field being in there as well would be best (currently we simply hard-code our menus into the header module for clients, but we're wanting to branch out into the marketplace), I think it's pretty easy to wrap one's head around the idea that Theme settings are global settings and choosing your navigation menus there would be pretty appropriate."
