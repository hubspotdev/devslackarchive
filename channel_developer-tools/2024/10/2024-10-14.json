    "text": "Hi everybody, I'm trying to use a workflow to get location data using the google api client.  I've created a google API project and key for the googleapiclient library for python, how should I go about using this to get location data? Examples I've seen in tutorials seem to require installing other libraries, so that's not an option here. Would I have to add services to the API project? Many of those are paid, I'd rather avoid doing that.\n\nI'm new to this slack so let me know if this isn't the right channel for this question."
