    "text": "Hey Shiv theres no need to post this in several channels. This community is very active and you will likely get responses. The majority of the super active folks in this slack are in the western hemisphere. So you will likely get responses during normal working hours for that part of the world. Also its the weekend, this Slack gets quieter over the weekend."
