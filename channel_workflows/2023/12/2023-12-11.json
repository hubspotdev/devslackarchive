    "text": "Good morning everyone! Does anyone have an amazing way to catalog workflows? I'm developing workflows for a nonprofit client with 3 or so major workstreams, turning each automation piece into it's own workflow for modularity but it's starting to become quite a rats nest so I'd like to find a great way to catalog and create a less complex dewey decimal system for this library of workflows. I recognize that HubSpot does provide some organization tools but I'd prefer not to use folders and I also need a way to sequence all of the different parts of the automation. Any suggestions are appreciated! Thank you.",
