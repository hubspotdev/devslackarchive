    "text": "Hi all. Is there anyone who can clarify for me why am I not getting response 207 when using batch contacts creation endpoint?\n```/crm/v3/objects/contacts/batch/create```\nI send 10 data for 10 contacts to the endpoint and I intentionally force an error (I try to send some already existing contacts). However, instead of response code 207 with the appropriate response structure, I receive response code 409 with only the error structure. Is response for status code 207 currently not being sent by HubSpot API or am I doing something wrong here?\n\nThanks for your time",

Is the GET /deals/v1/deal/recent/modified API suppose to bring back deals that have been modified LTE to the \"since\" query param you pass or should it be LT?
