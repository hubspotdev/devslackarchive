    "text": "Hello everyone,\nI have a question about using onCrmPropertiesUpdate. Is it possible to watch for changes in line item properties that are associated with a deal record? Or is onCrmPropertiesUpdate limited to the main object record type that the card is loaded on, such as Companies, Contacts, Deals, etc.?\nIn my current use case, I'm pulling associated line items into a Panel component that contains CrmPropertyList components for each item. This setup allows the sales team to edit properties like price, cost, and other custom fields. I would like to add a component at the top of the Panel that calculates the total price and cost of all line items. While I've managed to display these values correctly on the initial load of the Panel and line items, I'm having trouble getting the total values to update when the properties within the CrmPropertyList are changed.\nAny insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

    "text": "Hey Annie, `onCrmPropertiesUpdate` only watches for changed on the primary object type that the card is located on, not any associated items.\n\nYou could make an API call to refetch those line items in the callback for `onCrmPropertiesUpdate` . Appreciate the feedback :slightly_smiling_face:"
