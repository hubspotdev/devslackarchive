    "text": "*Hey everybody,* \n\nOver time we just recieving some 404 pages with no explanation how we get them. I search and try to find the problem and couldnâ€™t find anything. So maybe someone could help me why we keeps recieving 404 pages. We recieve this in google search console where we try to optimize our website. I build my own theme within HubSpot, but I could not see where it goes wrong.\n\nHere are some examples:\n*<https://www>.***.nl/ui-asset-management-lib/static-1.3331*\n\n*<https://www>.***.nl/feedback-loader/static-1.14406*\n\n*<https://www>.***.nl/MeetingsPublic/static-1.32730*\n\nIf someone know how we get these 404 that would be amazing.\n\nThanks in advanced and have a nice day!"
