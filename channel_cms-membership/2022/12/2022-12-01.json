    "text": "<@U3A4KEWK1> actually I was able to pinpoint the issue much better later on. The problem was a weird interaction with Cookiebot, so that if I would accept or decline cookies from within the login page once loaded (before trying to log in via the login form) that error would show up on the first try to log in. Next attempts would always succeed. Only in this specific scenario did the error occur, that is if I would interact with cookies in other pages the bug wouldn't be there.\nStrangely enough, after dealing for some days with HS support (which wasn't able to help because there was no apparent significant error to lever), the issue vanished, all of a sudden."
