Reading about the recent standardization <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/new-standardization-of-date-formats-for-HubSpots-form-submissions-api#:~:text=Starting%20Tuesday%2C%20November%2030th%2C%202022,be%202022%2D05%2D16)|here> it seems that the date either needs to be in YYYY-MM-DD format or a unix timestamp.\nWe are an integration developer. Is there no way for us to send the date to HubSpot in one format without knowing which date format every user account would accept?",
