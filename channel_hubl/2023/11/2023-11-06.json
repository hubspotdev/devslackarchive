If the row is not set to published then the page should be hidden from the top level index page and should throw a 404 error if someone tried to access the URL for the “detail” page. The first part I’ve got working, but anyone any idea how I can generate a 404 error in HubL"

To resolve this, all I did was create a module with nothing but the fields I needed for this template. I make it so it's unavailable in the page builder UI and then add it to my template and export it to the template context. Everything worked as expected."
