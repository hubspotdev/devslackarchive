    "text": "Hi <@U6URG5205> really sorry for being sluggish here. I did talk to the lists team, thereâ€™s not much we can do here as that limit is in place to protect reliability. They did note that this limit is mainly problematic because of the lists your app is migrating, not so much because of the workflows. So the issue comes into play when you create more than 3k lists for a portal."
