    "text": "Hey everyone, I put together a simple module to pull information from the product line item table to be used in emails.. the `email_each` fuction didn't work for our use case as we needed the ability to sort the records by product name and we couldn't get it to sort with `email_each`.\n\nThe module I put together was working while testing and we were about to implement it, however is suddenly returning nothing and showing up blank in emails... Really scratching my head over this one and hope someone can help! :pray::skin-tone-3:\n\nCode I used is below - any thoughts on why this might be happening?\n```{% set email_list =deal.line_items %}\n  {% for item in email_list|sort(false, false, 'name') %}\n&lt;b&gt;Workshop Date and Time(s):&lt;/b&gt; {{item.workshop_date}} - {{item.start_time_s_}}&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Number of Workshops:&lt;/b&gt; {{item.quantity}} x {{item.delivery_method}}&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Module:&lt;/b&gt; {{item.business}} - {{item.name}}&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Year Level:&lt;/b&gt; {{item.year_level}} - {{item.no__participants}} participants&lt;br&gt;\n{% endfor %}```\n"
