    "text": "Hi everybody!, IÂ´m trying to solve all of my HubSpot API requirements only with serverless functions, and some of this solutions are pretty good, for example: I built a page that creates multiple contacts via ajax, it was so useful because the basic embedded form creates one at a time, but this solution is hosted in the same account that I did my serverless functions query.\n\nI thought that I could solve third part APIs requirements with this tool, the problem is HubSpot always blocks all of this external webhooks to a serverless functions endpoint, I know it because I did the same process, same parameters, same HubSpot API endpoints but with another backend solution (PHP in this case) and works like I need(with serverless functions send me a 403 error), Did I miss something? or Do I need any additional configuration for unlock this external queries?",
