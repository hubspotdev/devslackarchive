But for some reason the module files, i.e the `fields.json`, `meta.json` are not appearing in my FTP client even though the modules according to the design Manager were correctly creating. Can anyone provide more insight/help on this?",

I'd have to learn more about the override toggle, but that also sounds like a good solution if this doesn't work – ideally, it would all happen automatically, but I can see a benefit to being able to do it manually as well. Thanks!"
