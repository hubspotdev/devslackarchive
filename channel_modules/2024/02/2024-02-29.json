We are in the middle of revamping quite a few of the default modules with a big a11y push, but at various paces depending on the modules and upcoming :zipper_mouth_face: updates. Feel free to DM me or post here what you’ve found!"

    "text": "Can anyone give me some advice or hints for optimising loading scripts in my modules? I have several modules that share resources - for example I am pulling in a swiper CSS and JS in to my meta.json file, and I have a few different modules that use those same files. I have applied `render_options` to the CSS and JS but this does not seem to affect `assets` only the module JS CSS file. How do I add loading options to files in `css_assets` and `js_assets`? The autoload option seems undocumented, and doesn't seem to make any difference if its true or false. Any tips?\n\n```{\n    \"css_assets\": [\n        {\n            \"autoload\": false,\n            \"path\": \"../css/ondemand/swiper-bundle.min.css\",\n            \"name\": \"swiper-bundle.min.css\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"js_assets\": [\n        {\n            \"autoload\": false,\n            \"path\": \"../js/ondemand/swiper-bundle.min.js\",\n            \"name\": \"swiper-bundle.min.js\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"js_render_options\": {\n        \"position\": \"header\",\n        \"async\": false,\n        \"defer\": true\n    },\n    \"css_render_options\": {\n        \"async\": true\n    }\n}```\n",
