Once all the actions you want are completed, clear that filed that you set. In a workflow where you want a particular contact to enroll only after it has all the necessary data - put as a trigger that this field is False (along with other triggers). .&gt; But this can be tricky. That's one way. The second way is: Set the workflow that sends notifications to the manual enroll, and add it at the end of the workflow that syncs the data - that at that point the contact enroll in that other workflow. (But only if you use two contact based wf)"
