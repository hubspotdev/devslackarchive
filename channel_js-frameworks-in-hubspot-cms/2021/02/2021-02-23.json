    "text": "I’m not sure how many react modules are in the marketplace. I know there’s a theme that heavily uses react though.\n\nAnyhow I think what you should decide based on is - Is react and all that comes with it necessary for what you’re building?\n\nFor example - say you’re building just a simple button that when clicked reveals some content.\n\nLoading all of react for that would be pointless overhead.\n\nOn the flip side, say you were building a sophisticated pricing and packaging module that calculates the price as the customer marks all of the stuff they need.\n\nThat involves some complicated state, and performing math frequently. That may be a good use-case for react.\n\n\nBasic jist - if you are handling some crazy sophisticated state stuff Yeah, reactjs or VueJS are a great option.\n\nIf you’re not - it’s probably not worth it."
