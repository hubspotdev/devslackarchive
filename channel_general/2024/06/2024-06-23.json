    "text": "Hello <@U03AKL6Q1B2>\n\nLooking at settings, I can see Tools -> Content -> Pages.  This gives me access to say integrate with GA4.  From here I can select the HubSpot managed domain.  It also allows me to select the subdomain ( which again is hosted outside of HubSpot )\n\nNow I can go to Account Setup -> Tracking & Analytics -> Tracking Code and I see a tab called Advanced Tracking.  When looking at this list, I can see my subdomain identified with a type = Hosted - but I don’t think that is correct since the Sub Domain is hosted by SAP.\n\nFrom my understanding, what I need to do is copy the code snippet that is on the Tracking Code and embedded that into my subdomain then it will send to HubSpot Analytic information as well as sending info to GA4 ( note that both HubSpot Hosted site as well as SAP Hosted site are using the same GA4 tag id.\n\nSo under Tools -> Content - Domains & URLs should I remove the subdomain that is hosted by SAP?  Should I remove Shopify hosted sites as well?"
