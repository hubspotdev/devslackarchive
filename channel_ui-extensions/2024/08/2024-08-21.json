I was hoping I could make the following directory structure so I can segment the different features I want to make for each department, but it looks like I can't do what I outlined below because the extensions folder is required, vs pointing to it with a variable?\n\n```ui-extension-repo/\n- app.json\n- sales-extensions/\n-- close-deal-cards.json\n-- CloseDealCard.jsx\n- retention-extensions/\n-- retention-company-cards.json\n-- CancelCompanytCard.json\n- customer-success-extensions/\n-- onboarding-deal-cards.json\n-- OnboardingCard.json\n- ...```\nAfter reviewing all of the samples, it looks like all of them use the extensions directory and each repo will need to serve a single purpose. I would prefer to do it how I mentioned because I would only have a single repo to worry about.",

Storing tokens in context would make the whole process seamless"
