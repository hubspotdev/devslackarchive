    "text": "&gt; The fields available for themes are intentionally limited versus what is available for modules. In general, theme fields are best for CSS related tweaks, and <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/global-content|global content> is better for actual content.  This is to encourage practices that are good for content creators.\n&gt; Example problem: Your company has a tagline. You would consider it to be part of your branding.\n&gt; Problematic solution: You might think to add it to the theme fields, where all of your branding goes.\n&gt; This results in an experience where content creators can’t edit the tagline from the content editor and have no idea why. Instead they need to go to the theme editor.\n&gt; Better solution: Use a global module, the global module could be placed inside of global partials, like your header or footer. Enabling you to have 1 place to edit the content across all of the places it lives. \n&gt; The content creator can easily highlight and directly edit this content being aware it is global."
