    "text": "Hey guys!\nIf someone could share experience on how to extract associations data the best way, I would be super grateful! :blush:\nAs far as I can see there are several ways:\n1. Ingestion via webhooks - only few of associations types covered. Doesn't seem to work for us as as we need some associations that are not listed, e.g., tickets to calls.\n2. Ingestion via API - we're using v3 API batch read and ingest the following relations: deals to contacts, deals to companies, tickets to contacts, tickets to deals, tickets to company, tickets to call. The ingestion takes around 1,5 hours and we're expecting this number to grow with the growth of the data. Moreover, it's not that stable as sometimes fails in the middle of load with SSL error, so that's why we want to optimize it.\n\nAre there some nice ways to handle associations incrementally?",
