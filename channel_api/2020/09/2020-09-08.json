CID has also been added as a contact property in HubSpot.\n\nWe have successfully been doing manual imports using that value to associate companies and contacts.\n\nI would like to import some companies and then import contacts using this CID value to associate the contacts with the companies.\n\nI have been testing importing contacts and companies with the \"imports\" endpoint, but I'm not sure how to make the association work.\n\nCould you please show me how the \"importRequest\" should be setup for the contacts import and let me know if there is anything else I should be aware of? Let me know if my request is unclear. Thanks.",
