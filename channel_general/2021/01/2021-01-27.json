I'd chucked that link over to the team asking about it yesterday.\n\nThere seems to be a notion that other CRMs can expose more than just first/last/sessions through a cookie. Definitely arguments that this could be risky from a DP standpoint, however the guys still want to start personalising website experience based on things like lifecycle stage, deal stage, etc...\n\nIf only we used HS CMS ;)"
