Many, many ways to set something like this up and it’s incredibly dependent on your specific needs. You will certainly need serverless functions, whether it’s HubSpot’s or some 3rd party service to make the API requests securely.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no way to mutate data using HubL alone. Same goes for any API operations that will mutate data…with perhaps a very small number of exceptions."
