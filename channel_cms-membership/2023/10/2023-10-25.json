    "text": "Hey everyone, was looking to get some general direction on a cms hub ticket portal. I am very familiar with HS on the CRM and MA side and have built many integrations for HubSpot before there, but am not familiar with CMS Hub. There are seemingly a lot of different tools and ways to build things in CMS and was just looking for some general direction. I am familiar with the Service Hub portal and there are some requirements that I have that can’t be fulfilled today using it unfortunately. I realistically am just looking to build a portal with\n• login/registration using Memberships\n• a ticket table page showing all tickets for the contact with filtering capabilities (tickets associated to just the contact and for certain contacts to primary company)\n• a ticket detail page (edit ticket, see communication)\nI see there is a <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react-boilerplate|react boilerplate project>, but that looks like it’s legacied now? There are now JS building blocks that look possible? Looks like there is also this <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/dynamic-pages/crm-objects|documentation for dynamic CRM pages> that looks like maybe I don’t need to go a react route? I have also found this <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-event-registration/tree/master|event registration app> which now also looks legacied?\n\nI am really just trying to get pointed in the right direction of what is the most optimized toolset to use within CMS Hub to build an application like this and if there are any sample projects or training/docs that would be helpful.\nThanks everyone!"
