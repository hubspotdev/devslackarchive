Since we are also doing outreaching on behalf of those clients, we are trying to incorporate those campaign data that we run on behalf of our clients into HubSpot as well. So we are able to create and keep all our dashboards in one place for central access. Would love to hear how we might be able to go about it."

Additionally, the tracking code is embedded on the site.\nHowever, I've noticed an issue with the tracking of incoming leads. Despite our efforts, the original source of these leads is being recorded as direct traffic. In reality, these leads should be attributed to paid search (ads properties are not being populated as well...)\nHas anyone ever faced that issue and can assist?"

But none of these events are being passed into the Meta Events Manager. And I also noticed that on HubSpot, it’s saying the last synced events for the Meta lifecycle stages are all in April, even though there have definitely been lifecycle stage events since (and the other platforms have been synced more recently). I have no idea and can’t figure out why this is happening; would anyone be able to give any advice on where to look at, or how to fix this?",

I see that I can make it global from the Design Manager.\n\nI just want to make sure I understand what will happen if I do that.\n\nI'm _*expecting*_ that it will just *replace* that module on every post with my global version, but this is on like 200+ posts so I just want to be super sure before I pull the trigger. :face_with_peeking_eye:\n\nI want to avoid a scenario where I have update every blog post and place the global module instead. If that's the only way to do it that's fine but I'm hoping it'll be easier than that.",

It's located in \"Actions\". you can roll-back almost everything. \n• if you have cloned the module before making it global there's a chance that you could simply restore it. \n• You could leave the \"non-global\" module version for \"testing purposes\" in the template and just hide it with a wrapping HTML(see screenshot). BUT depending on your module complexity and the generated content I'd suggest to delete it from the template once you've successfully moved to the global version(can have SEO and performance impacts)\n",
