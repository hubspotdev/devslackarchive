    "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm in the process of writing down tempaltes for pages created using the Visual Builder in HUbspot. From all my research so far I understand there's no way of adding custom classes to dnd_rows or dnd_columns but I see I have the option of adding a custom class to the dnd_area tag. I see that it's possible to add multiple dnd_areas on a html+hubl template however I haven't seen anything like this in practice yet.\n\nBearing in mind that I NEED classes in order to make sure that when I apply a template to a page and then the user comes in and edits that, the CSS will remain the same for the sections in the original template my questions is: Would it be okay to use a dnd_area for each section of a page so that I can add custom classes to each section?\n\nWhat's your take on this?",
