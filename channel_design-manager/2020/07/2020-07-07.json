    "text": "Hello everyone, since few weeks we saw that json viewer plugins were not working anymore to find variables in json tree via the “developper info menu” HubSpot gives to us.\nWe’ve tested almost each json plugins but we can’t find variables which definitely are in the page. We didn’t notice any reported bug about those plugins via the community so i’m asking there. The only way  to see and find variables now is to turn off each json plugin, this way and even if the interface looks wild we can find our variables. But that’s not really convenient. Few month ago I was finding each variables I needed in this json tree and with plugins.\n\nThank you for your help"
