    "text": "Hey folks! I am new to HubSpot and this is not the right channel to ask but I need some help.\n\nHow can I set up HubDB to automatically create pages based on the number of records added, using data inserted from a third-party service?\n\nHow can I create a dynamic process where adding records to HubDB automatically generates new pages, reflecting the newly inserted data. I tried using `Enable creation of dynamic pages using row data` but this is creating a single page  but I need pages for all the records.\n\nIs there a way to achieve this or do I have to use the `create site page`  endpoint individually?\nAny insights would be helpful. Thanks",

    "text": "Hello everyone,\nDo any of you have a site developed on the HubSpot CMS? We're currently using Webflow, but as part of our website redesign, I've come across numerous articles highlighting the improvements of the HubSpot CMS. Since we already use HubSpot for Sales/Marketing/Service, having our CMS on HubSpot could presumably allow us to further optimize our site, which is aimed at lead generation.\nI'm very keen to hear your feedback!\nThanks a lot :slightly_smiling_face:",
