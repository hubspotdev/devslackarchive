Many of the updates that were made this month are in the beta, we will roll those updates out to the stable build soon!\n\nHacktoberfest is over and they’re starting to send out the swag.\n\nWhile there won’t be swag in it for you (sorry the extension does not make money in any way, so I can’t give it out) - there is still a list of tasks we could use help with, as we work toward making HubSpot even better for developers.\n\n<https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/>",
