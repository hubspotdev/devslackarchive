I'm creating a property group and properties to nest in it using api and I got the error \"Property groups doesn't exist\" when trying to create the first property as in fact, I just created it within the same program. Does HubSpot API need a delay or something between the creation of a group before we can post properties in it? Here's the code:",

    "text": "Hey everyone!  I'm trying to use the SingleSend API to send our order tracking emails to customers but ran into a roadblock in the documentation.  The way I understand this is that everything included in the POST call under custom properties will create a new custom propery in HubSpot -- which I do not want to do (Delivery dates and Tracking Numbers for example).  That said, the documentation does mention other message options but does not go into any detail - nor does it mention how to use this endpoint without creating new properties for all of the information included in the tracking email.  Has anyone else run into this or have suggestions?  Thanks in advance!",
