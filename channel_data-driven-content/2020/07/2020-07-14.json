HOWEVER, in Firefox, the data is displayed in reverse. Just Firefox. I have no idea why FF would read this differently.\n\nIf I use “name” instead of “-name” for the ordering, everything reverses… including FF. So FF is now displaying correctly, but everything else is now Z-A instead of A-Z. Ideas anyone??",

We are going to create a HubSpot form for people to reserve a spot in the event. I would like to update a column in the HubDB whenever a form submission has been made to make sure we never go over the maximum capacity.\nHas anyone found a way to update a HubDB field based on a form submission? I couldn't find a workflow or script to do this."
