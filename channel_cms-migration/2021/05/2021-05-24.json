    "text": "Hi guys :wave:\n\nWe are currently developing a new site for an existing HubSpot client.\nDo any of you have a couple of solutions for the launch process? We have our development site in a Sandbox environment which has completely different data to the Live.\n\nDue to the amount of content in their site, I wanted to avoid anything going down on the Live site during the deployment. My initial idea was to switch the DNS to the development version whilst we fix up the Live site with our new theme, pages, blogs etc.\n\nHowever, they have so many CTAs, Workflows etc which don't exist on our development version so it would still be partially broke. So my next solution was to use Content Staging so stage the new versions to use our new theme. Do you think this would be safe enough without messing with the Live site?\n\nLastly, do you know if there is a way to export/import all of the content from the development version? I have never came across this, the only thing I can see that you can export/import is the blog, HubDB and a couple other bits :face_with_rolling_eyes:\n\nMany thanks!"
