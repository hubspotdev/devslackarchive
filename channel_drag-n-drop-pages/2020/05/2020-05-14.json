    "text": "Hi all,\n\nAny idea how to convert an *existing* page implemented with Drag and Drop template into a DnD page?\n\nGiven that we have existing pages implemented by Drag and Drop templates, and we want to add the DnD area feature to them.\nCan we simply clone a drag and drop template into HTML and add the DnD snippet into it so that we can replace the template of an existing page with that template to have the DnD feature in place?\n\n\nI was not able to succeed in this since a coded template with a DnD snippet is not listed when I want to switch the template.\n `{% dnd_area \"body_dnd_area\" %}`\n        `&lt;!-- generates an empty drag and drop area drop-section --&gt;`\n  `{% end_dnd_area %}`",
