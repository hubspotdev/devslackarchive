But it could be a pb.\n\nHere’s an example :\nI created a custom banner hero module with background, style, text...\n— I would like to insert a custom module “Breadcrumb”\n— I also would like to insert a custom module based on HubDB that get some dynamic information\n\nWhat do you suggest ?\nThanks everyone :slightly_smiling_face:",
