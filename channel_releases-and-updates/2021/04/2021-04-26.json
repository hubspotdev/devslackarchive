This makes no sense, as a common way of integrating external softwares will be cut out of a top-tier licence.\nHubSpot is basically asking 7K more for a feature that used to be there."

    "text": "Oh and I also want to make another consideration: Webhooks used to be parts of the developer portals because of the enterprise tier of them. Removing webhooks from enterprise will remove webhooks from dev portals. The trial is 14 days, so we can just develop and test for 14 days and then we need to start again everything with a brand new dev portal.\nAlso, the new features of hub professional are not testable for dev... No serious work will be built upon these features, as no real devs want to commit on a maximum of 14 days and then start everything again from scratch"

We are switching back to the pro with all the automation part made on app webhooks (which are shitty, but hey, they are still free) because it makes no sense to add 7K for webhooks on a 14.4K enterprise. HubSpot is just losing 9K per year for this bad planned move...\nThink about if it would have been a mrktg enterprise... the difference is 29K per year"
