    "text": "so I have this issue with my slider (tiny slider, the plain javascript carousel i use) and HubSpot forms..\n\nIn my header of the page i have this slider, that is specified by 3 slides with an image, some text etc. but also a form.\nNow, not too crazy right? but when i want to use an infinite loop, what usually happens is that the slider makes clones of these slides and appends these to the DOM. Here is where it gets tricky, because the form is loaded through the DOM, the cloned slides do not possess the created form, while it was not there on the initialisation of the form.\n\nLong story, i know, but is there any way to have my forms in the cloned slides?",
