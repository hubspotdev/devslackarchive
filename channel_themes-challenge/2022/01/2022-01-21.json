    "text": "Hi <@U2H3TT8F2> I have done 1 of my theme and i just want to make sure i have done correctly\n1. Can I link the demo image url in templates and modules from my demo site? Because I have many demos, when I store images in the theme it makes the theme large size.\n\n2. About the submit theme step, first i need to submit the theme in HubSpot asset marketplace then create a project in Devpost with the same name, video, image preview, demo url, descriptions and submit right?\n\n3. Upload theme to HubSpot asset marketplace, i see HubSpot have 2 way to upload theme (Upload theme file, and HubSpot CLI to upload)\nCan i upload theme by click Settings icons -&gt; Website -&gt; Themes -&gt; Upload theme or use HubSpot CLI to upload?",
