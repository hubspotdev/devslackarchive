But they want to provide a newsfeed once someone subscribes where the subscriber can have a portal/newsfeed where they can add their favorite profiles. Is that possible in HubSpot? If not any ideas to use another platform that provides this feature and connect to HubSpot?",

    "text": "Bot question: is there some sort of way to use some HubSpot API to allow a chat bot to pull in information on a clients Dashboard data? For example, we create a bot that a client could go to and it would ask them if they want to learn about how many new contacts were created this month, how many leads have moved on to MQLs, how many blog views they've generated, and other KPIs like that?\n\nMy assumption is that we'd create something that would pull data from HubSpot and then re-assign it as a custom contact property that would then just be displayed as a personalization token (while also assigning those values of those custom fields to the client's records in HubSpot).\n\nI was literally just approached about this my upper management and was curious if someoone else had done this or had ideas about it",
