    "text": "The good news about these new APIs is they all work exactly the same across any CRM object, including companies.  You can find the companies documentation here: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs-beta/crm/companies>\n\nWhile we don’t expect too many breaking changes, I wouldn’t put this into a production app just yet. We’re paying close attention to feedback and reacting quickly (so please let us know what you think).  So far all the feedback has been positive so no changes planned but as more people start to play with these APIs we might want to make some changes."
