    "text": "Hi! We're looking to have a Custom HubSpot API Integration built to have a bi-directional sync with corresponding Airtable tables. The scope will include using many HubSpot objects (particularly deals and line items) and need to be bi-directional with associations as well. Full scope and details can be communicated.\n\nWe have the requirements of the integration mapped with receiving fields in both locations - the integration is what needs to be built. This is a project we need to have completed within a month at the very latest. Budgets can be discussed. We will want to see past examples of HubSpot integrations built. If you're interested, please send me a message and we can set up a time to have a call next week. Thanks!",
