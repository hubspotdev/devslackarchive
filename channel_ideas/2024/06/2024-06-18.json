    "text": "I was just envisioning like a star or something to \"pin\" to the top. For example, when I was working on one page I kept going to this Logo folder in files, but I would have to scroll down and it was hard to find. Doing it over and over for a lot of logos made me wish I could pin the logo folder to top while I was working on this page. Same for the page list, I'm in and out of the same 2-3 pages at a time while working on them. I know you can filter by last update or something but I still think a pin/star would be a nice touch. I'll post something about it when I get a chance! It might also be nice to just pin the home page or other important pages that you come to a lot, even if you haven't worked on it recently."
