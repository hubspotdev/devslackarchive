It also may help you find others experiencing the same issue, and enable HubSpotter’s to more quickly troubleshoot.\n\nHubSpotter’s do hang around here, but it is not guaranteed that one will respond.\n\nIf HubSpot functionality appears to legitimately be having an issue and it’s impacting your portal or work, contact support.\n\nIf your issue appears to be a pretty significant,  please check our status page <https://status.HubSpot.com/>\nIf lots of portals are experiencing the issue, we provide regular updates there to let you know the resolution progress.\n\nIf the issue is related to a developer beta, go to the beta’s slack channel and post about it there. The developers working on that functionality hangout in those channels and you will be directly helping them improve HubSpot."
