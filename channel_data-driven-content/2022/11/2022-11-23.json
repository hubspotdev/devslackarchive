    "text": "Is it possible to add the GraphiQL Explorer to a portal even though they don't have Sales Hub Enterprise or Service Hub Enterprise?\n\nSince CRM Development Tab is part of those products, but GraphQL is available with CMS Pro, it doesn't make sense to nest the explorer under the CRM Development Tab.\n\nI'm working on a project for a customer where we need to use GraphQL and using without the explorer is quite a challenge (especially for custom objects associations). The thing is this customer have CMS Pro but doesn't have Sales Hub Enterprise or Service Hub Enterprise so I can't activate the beta to have the CRM Development Tab.\n\nCan we have the explorer in another way?",
