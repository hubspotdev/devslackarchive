    "text": "Hey Rakel. This isnâ€™t a `sneaky hidden feature` of HubSpot, despite seeming like it. It is rather just a slightly obscure oddity of how theme templates kind of work.\n\nThe gist is that when you make a template file say `homePage.html` if it references `{% extends \"./path/to/base.html\" %}` it is technically, at the end of the day, nestled inside of the `base.html` file. And the oddity that I mentioned above is that you can create a variable inside of `homePage.html` called `{% set template_css = \"path/to/template/file.css\" %}` and it will be picked up and added to the base file.\n\nYou could, alternatively, just call `{{ require_css(get_asset_url(\"path/to/css_file.css\")) }}` directly in `homePage.html` but doing so you have less control over where that css file is injected. This might result in cascading style clashes. But is 100% a valid technique :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nDoes that make sense?"
