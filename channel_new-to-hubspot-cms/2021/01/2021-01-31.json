But when I test same template only in Gmail App then Footer does not show as full width it show only 50%. I have checked media query all is correct. If I view that same template in mobile in browser it looks perfect, this problem occurs only when I view in Gmail app.   Could anyone please help me to find the solution? Thanks!"
