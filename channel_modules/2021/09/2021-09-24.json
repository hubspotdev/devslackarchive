I don't want to recreate table-editing functionality using module fields (it doesn't sound THAT hard, but I bet it's harder than assumed!). What's the best way to go here? Just make a module with rich text that prepopulates with a table as a \"hint\" to the user?\n\nAppreciate your advice, thanks!"
