This <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/marketing-email/why-is-my-email-missing-the-preview-text-widget|article> says the code should be like this:\n```<div\n  id=\"preview_text\"\n  style=\"display:none;\n  font-size:1px;\n  color:{{background_color}};\n  line-height:1px;\n  max-height:0px;\n  max-width:0px;\n  opacity:0;\n  overflow:hidden;\"\n>\n  {% text \"preview_text\" label=\"Preview Text\", value=\"\", no_wrapper=True %}\n</div>```\nwhile the auto-generated template  has already this:\n```    <!-- Preview text (text which appears right after subject in certain email clients) -->\n    <div id=\"preview_text\" style=\"display: none\">\n      {% text \"preview_text\" label=\"Preview Text\n      <span class=\"help-text\"\n        >This will be used as the preview text that displays in some email\n        clients</span\n      >\", value=\"\", no_wrapper=True %}\n    </div>```\nSo, is it important to include the\n```  line-height:1px;\n  max-height:0px;\n  max-width:0px;\n  opacity:0;\n  overflow:hidden;```\nor better to use the `{% text \"preview_text\"` with the label?"
