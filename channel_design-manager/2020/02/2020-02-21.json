    "text": "Ohhh man - Megamenus and HubSpot are notoriously tricky… I am in the tail end of a pretty complex one now. What made the process the easiest for myself is actually making use of the `menu()` function and building out everything myself with some nested for loops to create the structure.\n\nIt works really well and arguably takes equal if not a little less time than digging through all of the default classes and wrappers and what not that HubSpot uses when creating menus. Not to mention it gets rid of all of the overriding work you will need to do.\n\nBut it sounds like youre pretty far in the process already and are just trying to style the third level? What issues are you running into?"
