    "text": "Hi,\n\nI am a NetSuite developer but we do not have Webhooks in our HubSpot subscription, but I hope I can help you forward.\n\nWould you be able to get the HubSpot signature from the header?\n\n*Security <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/webhooks#security|  >*\n\nTo ensure that the requests you're getting at your webhook endpoint are actually coming from HubSpot, HubSpot populates a `X-HubSpot-Signature` header with a SHA-256 hash of the concatenation of the app-secret for your application and the request body HubSpot is sending.\nTo verify this signature, concatenate the app secret of your application and the un-parsed request body of the request you're handling, and get a SHA-256 hash of the result. Compare the resulting hash with the value of the `X-HubSpot-Signature`. If these values match, then this verifies that this request came from HubSpot. Or, the request came from someone else who knows your application secret. It's important to keep this value secret.\nIf these values do not match, then this request may have been tampered with in-transit or someone may be spoofing webhook notifications to your endpoint.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/webhooks>"

I’m having an issue and I believe its a HubSpot bug… I’m using a form inside a custom module and I’m trying to redirect the forms to different urls in different pages that are using that custom module.\n\nI’m using hbspt.forms.create cos I need to add a callback function on submit.\n\nBut whats happening is that the module.form_settings.form.redirect_url is showing empty and I cannot redirect after form submission.\n\nI can change the inline thank you message per page with no issue, but when i select the redirect it shows empty.\n\nAnyone knows what can be going on?",
