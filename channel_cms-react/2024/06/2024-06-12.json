Inside my react app I am using material ui, framer motion, maplibre-gl, react-map-gl, axios, and other libraries. Can I get all the code into HubSpot ? or I am not able to do that ?"

I suggest you re-post to the <#C04AY1H2204|cms-react> channel to get more eyes on your question. The short answer is that yes, you can use dependencies in the React components inside of your HubSpot project using <https://github.HubSpot.com/cms-react/|cms-react>, but you would have to install those dependencies in your HubSpot application, and move the components into it as well. Also want to flag that there is a 50mb limit on project size, which you may run into if you add too many dependencies."
