The company I am working for doesn't have an enterprise level subscription nor do they have the transactional email add-on. Given that info, I am trying to understand if `/crm/v3/objects/emails` will be my best bet, but the documentation page (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/email#tab-2>) doesn't make it clear if making a post request to this endpoint, will also send out the email."

As I was trying both options 'custom code' and 'Send a webhook' I have noticed that the webhook version does not work where the custom code does, prefferably, I would ike to use the webhook version.\n\nOn the webhook version, I get the error `Not authorised!` I have double checked the API Value and it does not contains any empty spaces before or after.\n\n\nThe Custom Code version does work.\nCustom Code:\n```const axios = require('axios');\n\nexports.main = async (event, callback) => {\n  try {\n    // Replace these with actual values or references to workflow properties\n    const firstname = 'Test';\n    const lastname = 'Test2';\n    const email = 'example@domain.com';\n    const Token = 'Bearer [TOKEN]'; \n\n    // API URL\n    const apiUrl = '<https://api-uk.bepreparedapp.com/v1/clients>';\n\n    // Request headers\n    const headers = {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'Authorization': Token\n    };\n\n    // Request body\n    const requestBody = {\n      firstName: firstname,\n      lastName: lastname,\n      email: email\n    };\n\n    // Making the POST request\n    const response = await axios.post(apiUrl, requestBody, { headers: headers });\n    console.log('API call successful:', response.data);\n\n    // Use the callback function to output data for later actions in the workflow\n    callback({\n      outputFields: {\n        result: 'Success',\n        responseData: response.data\n      }\n    });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('API call failed:', error);\n    callback({\n      outputFields: {\n        result: 'Failed',\n        error: error.message\n      }\n    });\n  }\n};```\nWhat is different on the webhook version? or is there something I do wrong?\n\nThanks for any assistance !",

Im currently creating the contacts via the Contacts API once they complete the checkout and land on the confirmation page.\n\nI know the Contacts API does not send over the HubSpotutk with the session details so all contacts get created as *Offline* by default. I've already added the javascript code with the 'identify' call that sends the hubspost session data before creating the user via the Contacts API and also tried creating the contact via the Forms API passing in the HubSpotutk cookie as a parameter but sadly none of those options has made a huge difference, 80% of our contacts still get attributed to *Offline sources*.\n\nI started logging the user's HubSpotutk to see if I could find any informacion and I found that even though in the customer data saved in the HubSpotutk the source is accurate, on HubSpot when going inside the contact it will say *Direct traffic* or *Offline sources.* Does anyone know why this might be?",
