    "text": "here’s my 2¢\n\nThere are undeniably benefits to a physical meetup for a developer day.  No matter what, putting a face to a name and meeting new people makes for better connections and collaboration in the future.\n\nPros of developer day at Inbound:\n- some devs are already going to be there with their agencies.\n\nCons of dev day at Inbound:\n- hotels are insanely expensive\n- HubSpot employees are worn out\n\nI like Nick’s idea about doing it at a different time than inbound, but I feel like we could probably swing it a little better more than two weeks separated.  Developer Day doesn’t need to be an offshoot of Inbound, it can be its’ own unique and valuable event.\n\nI think if we separate it a bit more, it might be able to get the attention and energy it needs and deserves from everyone.  Also, if your company just sent you to Boston for inbound, they’re probably not going to be too keen to send you again two weeks later.\n\nJon, I definitely think you’re on to something with trying to reduce budget as much as possible.  I’m wondering if there are other, more cost effective locations than Boston for an event like this."
