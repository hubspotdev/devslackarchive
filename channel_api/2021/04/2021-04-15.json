Generally most ecommerce integrations with HubSpot would use the <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/ecomm-bridge/v2/ecommerce-bridge-overview|Ecommerce Bridge API> to connect the external ecommerce application with a HubSpot account. Transactional emails for deals or orders would generally be generated from the ecommerce system.   Contacts, Deal and Product information would then be synced to HubSpot using the bridge. Marketing teams using HubSpot can then leverage this ecommerce information to segment the contacts using the Lists tool and use the workflow tool to  automate marketing emails like; abandoned cart, welcome emails, subscription renewal etc."
