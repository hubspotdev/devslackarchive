There is caching for your css files though.\n\nIt does appear though that you are trying to use a theme field for a logo when really you should be using a logo or image field in a module inside of your global partial. That gives the best experience for content creators."

    "text": "<@U7SL518D6> - Thank you, I was wondering what the best practice was for this as defining it as a field was a little odd when previewing. (Sidenote: This is for a landing page that uses a dark background so I need a different logo than our colored logo associated with our main website).\n\nI started with a simple image field in the header global partial, but this same image is used for the footer as well.  I wanted them to be able to define the image once and have it apply in both places.  From a branding perspective, logos, fonts, colors go together to brand a theme, no?"

It’s something we’re honestly trying to strike a good balance on, and it’s not always clear-cut.\n\nIf we go full on “Yes put your logo there” well then you might then think “tagline is used in multiple places, there should be a rich text field for setting that in themes, because it’s used globally”\n\nWhen in reality a global module or global partial  or both used together is really the better option for the content creator."

I jumped into the fields code instead of reading more thoroughly (whoops!). This makes much more sense.\n\nThe rest of the theming has been fantastic. I am able to quickly plug in my html/css that I developed locally and will probably be done with the draft implementation of our landing page by the end of the day, including 12-13 different modules.  Kudos to the HubSpot Team."
