For some strange reasons it does not always work. I guess sometimes it is simply wrongly documented or another type of call is needed\n• a simpler way is by using the requests library (works for both Python and Node JS). Just use the whole url *<https://api.hubapi.com>* + what is shown in the documentation in the title (*/crm/v3/objects/{objectType}/{objectId}* in my case as visible in picture) + ?hapikey= + api key.\nThe second should work for every call :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:"
