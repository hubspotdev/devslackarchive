I’m able to get access and refresh tokens successfully after a user installs my app, but I am doing that in my backend and need to store those in my DB to associate them with the correct user and then store them in localstorage in the user’s browser. after looking through the api docs i didn’t see what endpoint i can hit with an access token to get the userId that that access token is associated with. do you guys know where i should go for this? or maybe there’s a better solution than the one i’m thinking of?",
