    "text": "So the *resize_image_url* function is a god send and its amazing to be able to control image sizes (especially for BG images) at a code level for when clients don't listen and just upload massive images... that said it only fires if an image is 4000 x 4000 or less and i'm finding that it still ignores a lot of my client uploads since many images from Unsplash, Shutterstock, etc exceed this limit. Does anybody else run into that? If feel like if the limit was doubled it would handle 99% of my client image upload issues...",
