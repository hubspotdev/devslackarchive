    "text": "I'm struggling with a module issue, hoping to get some feedback. When we create an image or a logo type of module and we use a png/jpg it works great and we are able to update the height/width which are always forced to be relative heights &amp; widths. What I mean is that if I add an image to a logo or image module that is natively 200px wide by 100px high and I resize the width to 100, the height automatically changes to 50px correctly in the editor.\n\nUnfortunately, HubSpot's editor seems unable to parse the dimensions of SVG files so when I put in an SVG that is 200px x 100px, it always defaults to 400px by 400px (no matter what SVG I use, even if I use one that is 1000 high x 10px wide).\n\nAny suggestions? I get that SVGs don't parse the same way a non-vector image does... but It's a little surprising that HubSpot doesn't allow us to override the relative height/width ratio for images that it can't properly define.",
