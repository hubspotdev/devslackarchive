It's an additional cost to do it (used to be $1000 ($500 for dedicated API and $500 for transactional emails), but I can't find any pricing on the module anymore). Once you have the Transactional Email Module, you can follow these docs to add SMTP tracking to any ESP\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/marketing/transactional-emails>\n\nSince this endpoint exists, I'm not sure if there would be a plan to allow for tracking to be added only with the send still happening from a 3rd party ESP."
