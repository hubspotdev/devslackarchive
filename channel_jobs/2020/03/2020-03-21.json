I created a landing page (below) if you're interested in being added.\n\nI think it could also be nice to build a little network and maybe set up a way to keep in touch. Freelance life can be solitary at the best of times and more so in these crazy times!\n\n<https://www.stephanieogaygarcia.com/get-on-the-independent-freelance-HubSpot-directory>",
