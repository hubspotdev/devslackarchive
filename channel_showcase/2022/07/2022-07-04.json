    "text": "Hi all - we launched “Identity Checks Anywhere” with HubSpot last month. We verify the identity of an individual against their government issued passport, drivers licence, or ID card. In the Finance category this is known as “KYC” (Know Your Customer), but we’re discovering popular use cases among HubSpot customers that include Property (buying, selling, renting), Supplier/customer verification (particularly if the customers are overseas or in a category prone to fraud). Would love to hear your thoughts and potential use cases. Please also give it a try if you’d like (first 3 checks are free, and require no credit card). Thanks! :pray:\n<https://ecosystem.HubSpot.com/marketplace/apps/customer-service/customer-success/identitycheck-855428>"
