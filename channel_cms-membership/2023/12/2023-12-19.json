    "text": "Hi all, I have a question about private CMS pages and SSO management. Is it possible to manage B2C scenarios to give access to private areas to external users related to specific HS contacts (to retrieve contact personal data)? We explored the SSO configuration with Google, Microsoft and OKTA. It seems that we can only be connected to a B2B SSO scenario with an organization (employee oriented). Please, could you give me a feedback or share your thoughts about this case? Thanks in advance."
