But sometimes you run into a “WTF, how do I make TS happy with this?” case that can be really annoying and time consuming.\n\nIf you are good at ignoring editor red squiggles (and or throwing in an `any` type and moving on) then it might be no biggie. But if you are a person that needs/wants to always do things the “right way” or has a hard time ignoring those red squiggles, I’d suggest some hesitance before jumping into Typescript"
