    "text": "Hi,\n\nI am looking to create a file through the files endpoint but am running into issues.\nWhat I want to do is create a new file with text content. I.e. not from a file on the local system.\n\nI am able to create folders, but I keep getting either a 400 or 415 error. It might just be how I'm using the HubSpotClient library.\n\nExample of the code:\n```\tHubSpotClient.apiRequest({\n        method: 'POST',\n        path: '/files/v3/files',\n        body: {\n            \"file\": \"the file contents\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"access\": \"PRIVATE\",\n                \"ttl\": \"P2W\",\n                \"overwrite\": false,\n                \"duplicateValidationStrategy\": \"NONE\",\n                \"duplicateValidationScope\": \"EXACT_FOLDER\"\n            },\n            \"fileName\" : \"new-file.txt\",\n            \"folderPath\": \"/folderCreatedViaAPI\"\n        }\n    })```\nif I include headers, I'll either get a 400 or 415 error:\n```// 400 error        \n        headers: {\n            \"Content-Type\": \"multipart/form-data\"\n        },```\n```// 415 error\n        headers: {\n            \"Content-Type\": \"text/html\"\n        },```\nThere is no code example in the documentation here:\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/files/files>\n\nAnyone able to provide insight?"

I'm working with the *Visitor identification API*, and everything seems to be working fine, I got the token, I'm able to set up the  *identificationToken* and *identificationEmail*, and on the left side of the Conversation Menu, It shows the correct name, but when I open the Conversation, still shows *Unknown Visitor,* and the widget asks for personal information as email*.* Any idea what could be missing?",
