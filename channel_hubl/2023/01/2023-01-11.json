The negative margins can be confusing for non-developer content editors but at least you can find that.\n\nI wish you could add CSS to the editor too, but one cool thing I've learned is that, while you can't add a CSS class to a dnd_section in a template, if you create a \"Section\" file (templateType: section) you can add a CSS class to the dnd_section. So you could create a reusable section called \"Form with overlap\" and add that class."
