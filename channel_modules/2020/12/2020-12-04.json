Any ideas what is up? I luckily had one browser tab open with the old data still available so I could scrape it (there's quite a bit), tried quickly replicating this issue but failed. Quite baffling\n\nAlso the module now is somehow of the opinion that it is present on 0 assets even if the module is present on 10 published pages. I had to go to edit and update the pages with the module present for the changes in the global module editor to be reflected on the live side of things."
