    "text": "Hello all! Question for the group. I have an opportunity to share some massive greatness that can be done w/in HubSpot and developed. However, I'm still working on educating others (as well as myself) as to all the functionality w/in the system. As a Database Architect mindset - what items can you share that would be great to be developed w/in the program to enhance it's usability? I'm looking for suggestions!! I have some ideas - but what have YOU done? (especially w/ a non-profit mindset). I'm sure I don't even know what all it can do yet! Any ideas/suggestions/recommendations would be appreciated!! <#C22PU4LV8|general> <#C26E7JT8V|ideas> <#CCQ7H31D5|developer-tools>"

    "text": "Hello Team,\n\nWe are exploring options to automate the process of calling prospects from our HubSpot contacts. Below is the use case we aim to implement:\n\n1. The user selects a list of contacts and triggers a flow, or the process can be scheduled.\n2. The selected contacts should automatically receive a call from us.\n3. If the prospect answers the call, it should be redirected to the user's contact.\n4. If the prospect does not answer or the call goes to voicemail, the call should be terminated.\n5. After the call ends (whether answered or missed), the status should be updated in the call logs in HubSpot.\nCould someone suggest potential solutions for achieving this? From my initial research, I understand that Twilio could handle the calling part. However, I am unsure how it can be integrated with HubSpot. I attempted to integrate Twilio via *Settings &gt; General &gt; Calling &gt; \"Sign in via Twilio\"* for prototyping, but it requires a Sales Professional plan.\nAre there alternative ways to integrate Twilio (such as through APIs or other methods)?\nAdditionally, we are not limited to Twilio. If anyone has suggestions for other third-party tools that could fulfill our requirements, we are open to exploring them.\nLooking forward to your suggestions."
