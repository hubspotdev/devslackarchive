    "text": "Yea we have always used site search 360 for more complex indexing needs. Most of the time we can get away with the native HS search, I just never dug into how it works until now and am a bit disappointed. But I suppose it also makes sense why they would implement it that way. Maybe a cheap get around could be to impose a percentage match threshold. Maybe it’s also not a big deal for the client. But Its def bugging me hahaha"
