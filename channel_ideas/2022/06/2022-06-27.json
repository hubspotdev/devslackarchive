    "text": "Hi all,\nNew to this slack group and new to HubSpot development.\nI’m looking for a way to automate actions based on contacts viewing documents in Sales Hub. We’ve got Sales Hub Starter and my goal is to automate creating a task for our sales reps when a contact views a document. So far I haven’t found anything in the HubSpot’s API docs that references the documents tool or creating followup actions based on documents being viewed.\n\nSales reps don’t have access to HubSpot; they used to have Sales partitioned access but managed to delete a large number of unrecoverable marketing materials. I found how to sync HubSpot tasks to Salesforce for reps to view and act on, but need a point in the right direction for automating HubSpot tasks (or even just a workflow) once a contact views a document.\n\nOr if I’m entirely off base, any other ideas you all have would be much appreciated. Thank you!",
