Unfortunately, this integration was not built by us so we are not able to debug from our side. Any idea why this happens and how we can fix this issue? Thanks!",

That's what I was afraid of, I was browsing the documentation and I didn't find the way to customize the payload via Private App.\nFor the moment I think I'll go for making the API call that queries the information I need from the contact but I'll explore the other way of Ops Hub Pro. Is this second option compatible with the flow I am talking about? That is to say, receive notifications of modification and send personalized information of the contact but not activate any internal flow trigger in HubSpot. My goal is to be notified to modify via API a field X of the contact based on these inputs."
