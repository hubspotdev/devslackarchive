I have no idea how to troubleshoot this. Since it loads some of the time, I know it's not an issue with the form ID or anything like that. Curious if others have experienced this behavior."

    "text": "they are 3 different forms.\n\nBasically I have a module to make 'tabs' on a page. The module fields are a reoccurring group. One of the fields in the group is a 'form field'. So first I created my forms (3 forms in this case) and then referenced them in the form field.\n\nNo matter what 70% of the time the 3rd form will not load. Even if I recreate a form, it still only displays 30% of the time.\n\nSince the tabs are built with a for-loop, I know that theres nothing uniquely different about the 3rd tab / 3rd form.  There's also no errors in the console.\n\nIts a real head-scratcher"
