    "text": "Hello, quick question about clarifying HubSpot API CRM documentation:\n```crm.objects.contacts.read\tView properties and other details about contacts.\ncrm.objects.contacts.write\tView properties and create, delete, and make changes to contacts.```\nThe documentation gives assumption that using `crm.objects.contacts.write` scope also gives read permissions, but when trying to access object (e.g. contacts) data through API with oAuth authentication request fails with 403 permission denied message, complaining about not having read access. Should both `.write` and `.read` scopes be given when authorizing (<https://app.HubSpot.com/oauth/authorize> with &amp;scope= set correctly) HubSpot data access?\n\nWhat's weird that some of our customers' HubSpot apps / environments work well with just the `.write` scope, but now occurred the first one that requires both of those. Wondering if scope rights were altered lately or there's some app-specific issue here.",

    "text": "*How can I integrate REST API with my product?*\nHello, I want to know the actual process to send an email to a contact list. From the legacy documentation I understand that, I can create marketing email using the API but the email stays as draft. Is it directly sendable to contact list? Or do I have to use single-send-api for sending the drafted email? Maybe for using the single-send-api, I need transactional-email permission. But I faced the following issue when I went for the permission.\n1. Private App: Scope (transactional-email) is unavailable for this account. (I have super admin permission).\n2. OAuth 2.0: This account doesn’t have access to some HubSpot features that are required by this app. Please contact the app developer. (without transactional-email feature, it works).\nAnyone has solution? Thank you!",
