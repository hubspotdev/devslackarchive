    "text": "Hi <@U056K7NBBJQ> I assume that the 3 texts will be fields of type ‘Text’ and the ‘font-size’ of type ‘Number’ – however i would suspect to create an if-clause around the style – to only set it if a font-size is actually set (so if you don’t provide a default it can stay empty and the style-attribute with the font-size would not be rendered. Yet after the variable you would most likely add the metric you want to have there (be it ‘px’, ‘em’ or ‘rem’ – usually ‘px’) – e.g. `{{ module.title_s }}px;`"
