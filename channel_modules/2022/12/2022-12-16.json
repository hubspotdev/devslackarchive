I’ve opted to pass the text field value as a string with a HubL tag inside, since text_field sounds like it’s expecting a string.\n\n```{% dnd_module\n  path=\"../modules/imageBox\",\n  text_field=\"{{ context.text_field or 'Customer profitability' }}\",\n  show_image=false,\n  imageBox_styles={\n    \"alignment\": \"center\"\n  }\n%}{% end_dnd_module %}```"

I've tried updating the module name where it is used in the partial (in hopes that it would pull the updated module code) but that didn't work. It updates outside of a global partial no problem.",
