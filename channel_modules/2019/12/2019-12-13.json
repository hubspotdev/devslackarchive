    "text": "Hi!\nWe’re designing a new blog and one of the things we want to add is ‘content parts’, which we imagine would be premade modules like one on the screenshot below. Is it possible to add those modules to blog posts when creating posts? I don’t seem to find any interface that would allow me to do that. Actually, I can’t even add a ‘Flexible column’ to a ‘Blog template’, which I could do for normal ‘Page template’.\nI don’t know if this is appropriate channel for that kind of question, I don’t see a ‘blog’ dedicated channel.",
