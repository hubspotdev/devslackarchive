    "text": "Sure. Let's take OBJECTS_TASKS as an example.\n\nWhat I am trying to achieve is a log table that essentially looks like this:\n```OBJECTID\tSUBJECT\tSTATUS\t   TYPE\t    CREATED_AT\t        UPDATEDAT\t         INGESTEDAT\n1234566\t   Example\tCOMPLETED\tCALL\t2024-05-28 5:43:02\t2024-05-30 22:00:32\t2024-05-30 22:00:32\n1234566\t   Example\tNOT STARTED\tCALL\t2024-05-28 5:43:02\t2024-05-29 0:00:00\t2024-05-29 0:00:00```\nAt the moment, OBJECTS_TASKS is only shows current values as of last ingested time. This means if you don't have a frequent snapshot running based on last ingestedat timestamp from your target model, you may miss changes.\n\nSo, ideally, using the OBJECT_PROPERTIES_HISTORY, I was hoping to achieve the above which is showing 1 task, and it's transition from NOT STARTED to COMPLETED.\n\nThe issue here is that the OBJECT_PROPERTIES_HISTORY table, would only provide the following when the status changes:\n```OBJECTID\tNAME\t         VALUE\t   \tINGESTEDAT\n1234566\t   HS_TASK_STATUS\tCOMPLETED\t2024-05-30 22:00:32```\nIn this simple example, the solution is simply, I can just track changes of only that column however, in scenarios where there will be multiple columns changes at different times, I would have to create tracking statements for each column.\n\nIdeally, the history table shows the snapshot at row level for the entire object as the first example I provided.\n\nIf the OBJECTS_TASKS was a materialised table rather than a view, this wouldn't be an issue as I could set up a stream on the table to track changes and use that to create a log provided that change track was enabled for the table."
