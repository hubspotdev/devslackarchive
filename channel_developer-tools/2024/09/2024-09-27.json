    "text": "Hi folks. Not sure if this is the right channel or not. Please redirect me in the latter case... :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI have been using the REST API to retrieve various events for contacts. Events like engagements for example. I will use this to do an analysis on our sales and marketing processes.\n\nThe issue is that I can't find a way to retrieve:\n\n- Marketing emails. I have the list of marketing email templates, with their campaigns. I know that I can also retrieve general marketing email statistics. What I really need is the individual events of when the contact received the marketing email, if it was opened and if it was clicked. What makes it extra tricky is that sometimes marketing send emails from the salespeople's emails, so it's not so cut and dried. Sometimes they're sent from workflows, sometimes sequences, sometimes manually.\n\n- Page views. It seems that the only way to get this is from the events API, but it will only let me retrieve it for one contact per API call - I need it in bulk. There are way too many contacts for a per-contact basis (easily exceeding the API call limit). The events API requires me to put an objectType and objectID in the query parameters. Other events do not require this for some reason.\n\n- Ad clicks is the same situation as the page views.\n\nI've looked on a lot of the HubSpot forums, contacted the live chat and nothing has helped so far. Even just somebody telling me it's not possible would at least prevent me from using any more time on this. Appreciate any light that can be shed",
