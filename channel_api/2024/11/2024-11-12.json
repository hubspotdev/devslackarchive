However, when an order was associated with this contact on *October 16th*, my workflow’s custom code should have retrieved the latest 'main deal record ID'  to associate with the order. But when I retrieved it via the API, it returned `XXXXXXXX826` instead. Any idea why this discrepancy occurred?\n\nhere is my code FYI\n\nconst getContactDealId = async (contactId) =&gt; {\n  try {\n    const response = await HubSpotClient.crm.contacts.basicApi.getById(contactId,['main_deal_record_id'])\n\n    return response.properties?.main_deal_record_id;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error fetching contact:', error.message);\n    return null;\n  }\n};",
