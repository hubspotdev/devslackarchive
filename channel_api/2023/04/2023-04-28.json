If a user was to restore in either system, I'd like the restore to occur on the other.\n\nFor the restoration over to HubSpot. It looks like this isn't possible from this 2016 post, has anyone else tackled this or found a way around? I assume I could use the create contact endpoint and HubSpot will restore the contact and data instead - As long as it was within 90 days and not perm deleted via GDPR.\n\nFor the other way, is there a way to pick up when a contact has just been restored in HubSpot?\n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Restore-deleted-contact-with-history-via-API/m-p/233358>"
