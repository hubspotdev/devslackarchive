    "text": "Hey <@U7SL518D6>,\n\nI wanted to ask if there's any update on this workflow? Or is there anything on the horizon you have planned (in the near future) to make this easier?\n\nThe company I work with is still considering to give it a shot to work with version control, but the hassle of syncing between accounts is still a huge potential problem. The goal would be to make things easier, not more complicated.\n\nThanks again for your feedback, I appreciate it! :raised_hands:"

In my setup I use `vite.js` and this is what the config looks like:\n\nvite.config.js:\n```import { defineConfig } from 'vite'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  build: {\n    outDir: 'dist',\n    sourcemap: false,\n    emptyOutDir: true,\n    minify: false, // HubSpot handles minification. So this must be set to false.\n    rollupOptions: {\n      input: 'src/js/main.js',\n      output: {\n        entryFileNames: `js/[name].js`,\n        chunkFileNames: `js/[name].js`\n      }\n    },\n  }\n})```\nAnd the tailwind.config.js:\n```module.exports = {\n    content: [\n        './modules/**/*.{html,js}',\n        './macros/*.{html,js}',\n        './templates/**/*.{html,js}',\n        './sections/**/*.{html,js}'\n    ],\n};```\nThe config files are highly redacted and used just as an illustration.\nThe compiled assets are then imported into the `header`."
