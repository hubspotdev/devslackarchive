Does anyone have any advice on how to *bulk log historic emails* from *Gmail* to *HubSpot*?\n\nSome context - we've recently acquired another company, and are looking for the best way to log and backdate their emails into our CRM (HubSpot). The emails don't currently exist in any other CRM, just in Gmail.\n\nAny recommendations would be appreciated! Thanks in advance"

I have setup the Approval for a Permission Set and generally its working - however, after an approval the user can actually change everything and send the mail without another Approval request. Is this really the current state of it, or is there another setting to properly handle this case?\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance :slightly_smiling_face:"
