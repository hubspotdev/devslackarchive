Is there someone who might be responsible for the github repository \"HubSpot-api-python\"?\n\nI've gone ahead and submitted a pull request with the intention of incorporating a proxy configuration. This change would allow us to effectively utilize the HubSpot library within the context of our proxy setup. <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-python/pull/229>\n\nCould I kindly ask for assistance in reviewing and potentially accepting my pull request?\nYour support and guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!\nBest regards, Vera"
