    "text": "Did something change with using {{name}} as a unique identifier in HubSpot Modules? It used to be a unique class that could give custom styles to each element of a repeater (as one use case example). But now I”m seeing it generates something like “dnd_area-module-2” in all of them, making it NOT unique and breaking a fundamental tool we have to have for modules. Is there an alternative? Was there an update? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
