    "text": "Hey <@U028F34L5KJ>\n\nYou can customize the design for the pop-up form but unfortunately, styling for the pop-up form is very limited. However, if you on your team will able to add to the stylesheet of your site or just the pages you'll have the pop-up form on you can add some CSS to style the form yourself.\n\nSomething like this:\n```.leadinModal.leadinModal-theme-default.leadinModal-v3 .dyno-image {\n    float: none;\n    display: block;\n    margin: 0 auto 10px;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n.leadinModal .dyno-image img {\n    max-width: 100%;\n}\n.leadinModal.leadinModal-theme-default.leadinModal-v3.leadinModal-preview h4,\n.leadinModal.leadinModal-theme-default.leadinModal-v3.leadinModal-preview .advance-wrapper {\n    margin-left: 0;\n    text-align: center;\n}```\nNote:\nWith a bit of CSS styling and overrides, you can get the popup form to look more like a popup. by above with CSS styles should get you in the right direction. It's not ideal to modify a popup for but it does the trick if you didn't want to go with a nonHubSpot solution.\n\nLet me know if there have any other follow-up queries. Thanks!"

I’m curious how you’d expect this to work—do you only care about specifying which properties are included, or would you also want to customize the format of the payload that the webhook action sends?\n\nIn terms of workarounds, if including the extra properties is causing a problem, you could create a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/automation/custom-workflow-actions|custom workflow action> and specify which properties you want in the `objectRequestOptions` that are mentioned in the docs."
