    "text": "Hi question - i downloaded Atlas free from marketplace. I have cloned it and have been editing it successfully until I got to 'blog post' template. Can someone please explain in a simple way how i can make this template more fluid? How can I add the 'sections' and 'modules' to this in the same way i can ALL of the other pages?\n\nI have tried to add code from a module, I've tired adding my own raw code to it.. nothing is showing up, everything i add to it just shows in prod as a white block? Can someone just tell me how I can open up the CMS editor to have more options? I just want to add two modules from the website template . it seems i can't add anything to this? very frustrated.\n\nâ€¢ to add: i'm getting Error:The template can't contain \"dnd_area\" modules. Please remove \"hero_section_blog\" on line 56.      when i'm trying to add a dnd section. How do i get around this????",
