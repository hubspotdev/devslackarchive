Thanks for the heads up <@UD53A9UUR>. <@UCDEM8T63>, eventually the certification will change quite a bit to reflect the new tools and recommended workflows, but I wanted to give folks some time to settle in to the new stuff and also keep an eye on any pain points that show up to inform the content. So long story short: I'd take it now. The new one won't be out until EOY at the earliest."

So basically, as soon as they fill out the form fields and click the button, the popup displays on top of the LP.  I've been playing around with some different code options and it's just not working. Works as a hyperlink in text, but not on the Form CTA."
