    "text": "Hi Chris,\nThanks for your reply.\nWe want to use media bridge to allow our clients to insert autoplay videos into their email campaigns. When users drag and drop the module they will have a view of their existing videos on our platform and when they choose a video to add to the HubSpot email template it will copy the HTML code from our platform not just add a video tag, as it is a custom code to display the video with autoplay in the clients' email.\nTo make it easier to understand I attached a tutorial file. thanks in advance",
