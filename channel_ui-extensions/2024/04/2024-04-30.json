This sidebar can now be customized to display different information based on the user (see <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/object-settings/customize-record-previews|knowledge base article>). With this, you can now build extensions for the preview sidebar as a new location so that users can get the right information from different systems in one single view without having to open the record page, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity.\nThat is also very sweet"
