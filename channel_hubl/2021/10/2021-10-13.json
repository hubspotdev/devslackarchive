But for now, I am sorry we do not teach programming basics here. \n\nAnd please don't get me wrong, everyone is glad to help other developers, we always struggle with something and need from time to time a helping hand. But this is really basic stuff if you don't get it by your own, you will be hardly getting forward with programming custom templates."
