    "text": "Hi everybody! I would like to migrate lists API integration on my project from v1 to v3, but I'm having some issues and I hope somebody of you can help me out here:\n\nAt the moment I'm using the `POST contacts/v1/lists/{listId}/add` to add contacts to a specific list by email.\nFirst of all I create e new contact via email address and some other data with `POST /crm/v3/objects/contacts/`, then I use the previous to add the contact via email.\n\nBy using the new v3 api `PUT /crm/v3/lists/{listId}/memberships/add` can I continue using the email address as \"contact id\"? Is there a way to specify this? At the moment I was only able to store contacts by recordId. Unfortunately I can't find anything about it in the doc.",
