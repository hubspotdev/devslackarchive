    "text": "Hey HubSpot devs,\nthought this might be helpful for those of you working with the HubSpot API :electric_plug:\n\n<https://www.nango.dev?utm_source=slack&amp;utm_medium=msg&amp;utm_campaign=HubSpot-api-devs|Nango> is a new open-source tool to sync data from any external API to your local database with a single line of code: :recycle:\n```Nango.sync('<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts?limit=10&amp;archived=false>');```\nNango then deals with incremental syncs (deduplication, upserts, detecting changes), pagination, rate-limits etc. and pushes the latest data into a postgres DB of your choosing. It’s a self-contained service and there is a quickstart you can try in 3 minutes.\nIf you’re interested, details &amp; the repo are here: <https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango>",
