    "text": "Hey all, question for you guys, *have any of you tried using Zurb's Foundation for Emails with HubSpot*? I only ask because I hit kind of a conundrum.\n\nSo I built an email template with foundation, now I'm in the process of converting it to work with HubSpot. In foundation - I'm not inlining the CSS as it seems like a better idea to have HubSpot inline it, that way the email is easier to edit inside HS. The CSS is all in a stylesheet that gets included into the html email in a style tag, then gets inlined by the HubSpot inliner.\n\nProblem is because I'm having HubSpot do the inlining it breaks once it hits the first media query. HubSpot's inliner doesn't know how to do what the Foundation one does - where it separates media queries into a style tag instead of inlining.\n\n\nOnly solution I know will work is to not use the HubSpot Inliner at all and instead rely on the foundation inliner, the email code will be hell to read in HubSpot, so the only way to update the email will be to use the foundation version to update it, run the inliner, and update the code on HubSpot again.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts?"
