Unfortunately, I can't see neither the `sample text` , nor any editable fields in the left panel (screenshot below).\n\nMy module looks like this:\n```import { ModuleFields, TextField } from '<@UDA553DRD>/cms-components/fields';\n\nexport const Component = () =&gt; {\n  return &lt;p&gt;sample text&lt;/p&gt;;\n};\n\nexport const fields = (\n  &lt;ModuleFields&gt;\n    &lt;TextField name=\"text\" label=\"Text\" default=\"Default text\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/ModuleFields&gt;\n);\n\nexport const meta = {\n  label: 'Hero',\n};```\nAnd I use it in HubL template like this:\n```{%- module 'hero' path=\"@projects/xxxxx/js-package-app/components/modules/Hero\" label=\"Hero\" -%}```\nI even copied <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react/blob/main/examples/hello-world/hello-world-project/hello-world-app/components/modules/TodoList/index.jsx|the example TodoList module from cms-react repo> but it was still showing nothing.\n\nI'll be glad for any help, thanks in advance :pray:",

    "text": "Hello <@UPHA2AUEM> :wave-yeti:\n\nFrom looking at your code I notice a couple things. The first one potentially being the culprit:\n\n1. Your usage of the module in your hubL template has incorrect syntax `{%-`, you do not need to include the `-`. Rather should look something like this:\n```{% module 'hero' path=\"@projects/xxxxx/js-package-app/components/modules/Hero\" label=\"Hero\" %}```\n2. You need to pass through the `fieldValues` to your `Component` in order for changes to the field in the editor to update the rendered output on the page. This isn't causing your issue, but a suggestion to connect the fields to your component :+1:"
