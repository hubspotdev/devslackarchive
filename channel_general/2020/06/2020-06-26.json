    "text": "hey <@U012DUQMS03> it looks like you’re using javascript to fade the page in once it’s loaded.\n\nExcelion_March2020-main.js is adding a data- attribute to `&lt;body&gt;`\n```$(\"body\").attr(\"data-ix\", \"page-wrapper-load\"),```\nThis will be the “flash” - This javascript is included in the footer so the page will load (and appear) then this Javascript will execute (adding that data attribute) which in your CSS has an opacity of 0 - hiding the page.\n```[data-ix=page-wrapper-load] {\n    opacity: 0\n}```\nI didn’t check where this value is actually changed to 1, but somewhere a transition is being added to the page.\n```    transition: opacity 900ms ease 0s;```\nI recommend removing this. I don’t feel the transition adds anything, in fact I’d consider it a usability issue."
