    "text": "Hi everyone! I'm creating a HubSpot Form (using the new editor) and trying to associate \"Contacts\" and a custom CRM object.\nWhen I look at the details of the Review and Update panel, I see two messages:\n`Contact records will be updated if a form submission contains a matching email address. If the email address does not already exist in your HubSpot CRM, a new contact record will be created. This behaviour can be changed in settings.`\nAnd for the custom object:\n`This object doesn't have any associations defined yet. If you proceed, any new or updated records from this submission won't be linked to Financial Plans. You can add associations in your CRM settings now or continue without linking.Learn more about how associations work`\n\nBut my custom object has associations configured with the contacts.\nWhat am I missing here? Can forms and custom objects be associated?\nThanks",
