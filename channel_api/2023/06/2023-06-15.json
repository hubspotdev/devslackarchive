    "text": "<@U01QVR44MEY> Searching through a large number of files associated with various deals can be overwhelming. However, I have figured out a specific solution that can make it easier.\nWhen we attach a file to a deal in HubSpot, it becomes a note or something like that happens because we can show that file in the Deal notes section. By using the notes API, we can retrieve all the notes related to a specific deal. We can then batch read these notes using the `hs_attachment_ids` property.\nTo access the desired file information, we can call the API to get the file by its unique ID. This way, we can quickly find the specific file details we need.\nWith this streamlined approach, finding the required information among a vast array of files becomes much simpler.\nWhat are your thoughts on it? :thinking_face:"
