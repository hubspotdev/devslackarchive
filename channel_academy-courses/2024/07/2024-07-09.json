    "text": "Hey <@U07BDGD8FK8>, <@U07BNLB976Y>\nThe best way to start with hubl is:\n1. go to <http://developer.HubSpot.com|developer.HubSpot.com> and create a dev account(App dev accounts can have several cms developer accounts in them; might be a benefit)\n2. complete the <https://academy.HubSpot.com/courses/cms-for-developers|CMS for developers> certification in the academy (while it doesn't really matter from which account you're doing the theoretical part you should do the practium from a dev account)\n3. register in the <http://community.HubSpot.com|community.HubSpot.com> - and ask questions in the developer channel if you have specific questions. \nAlso - here's a list of \"must-know\" things about hubl that you'll partially need for the certification:\n• <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/if-statements|if-statements>\n• <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/for-loops|for-loops/repeaters>\n• <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/filters|filters>\n• <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/functions|functions>\n• <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes|themes>\n• <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/module-theme-fields-overview|custom module development>\nWhen you're just starting I'd recommend to use the design-manager. If you're more familiar with hubl, you should switch to <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started-with-local-development|local development> and install the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/install-and-use-HubSpot-code-extension|HubSpot vscode addon>",
