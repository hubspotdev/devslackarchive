    "text": "Hi! I'm new to using HubL and am wondering if anyone knows if you can use an If statement to filter the output of HuBL such that if a property _contains_ (not equal to) a certain value (as inputted by a HubSpot user in a field)\n\nI'm just not certain what the proper syntax might be and having a hard time finding this in the developer docs.\n\nTo give an example, we currently have the following If statement written: {% if project.name != null %}\n\nBut if I wanted to use a similar statement to further refine the output so that the project.name _contains_ a certain value, what would that look like?",

    "text": "<@UATE4ATHP> is correct — if you’re comparing against a string, `string_containing` will do what you’re asking for:\n```{# Prints \"bar\" #}\n{% set sample_var = \"kung-foo\" %}\n\n{% if sample_var is string_containing \"foo\" %}\nbar\n{% endif %}```\nIf — instead of a string — you’re checking against a list or array, you’d use the `containing` operator instead:\n```{% set sample_list = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"fizz\"] %}\n\n{% if sample_list is containing \"fizz\" %}\nbuzz\n{% endif %}```\nor, you can use the `within` operator if you need to invert the comparison:\n```{% set sample_list = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"fizz\"] %}\n\n{% if \"fizz\" is within sample_list %}\nbuzz\n{% endif %}```"
