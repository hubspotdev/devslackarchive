    "text": "here guys\nWe have lot of `pre-render` pages in HubSpot that reading data from HubDB, and our content team would update the data in HubDB and the pages are not picking up the changes (guess cause it is `pre-render`). The changes is not often, but it is important that the change to go out within 3-5 mins.\n\nSo it is possible to keep the `pre-render` but we set `prerender` age to refresh in a way like `stale-while-revalidate`\n\nAny advise?"
