The scan is done by <http://sucuri.net|sucuri.net> and the code in question that the scanner found malicious was `&lt;script&gt;var t=new Date;document.getElementById(\"timestamp\").innerHTML=t;&lt;/script&gt;` I'm not seeing this code anywhere in the source code or any timestamp ID throughout the site for that matter. This message was also attached: <https://labs.sucuri.net/db/malware/warning.html_anomaly?2> Has anyone experienced an issue like this before with a HubSpot site?",

So the following code in my footer doesn't load: ```\n    &lt;script src=\"{{ get_public_template_url('Dashboard/assets/js/dashboard-topnav.js') }}\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n```\nHowever, if I copy-paste the JS as an inline tag in the exact same location, it works fine. Any ideas on why it's not taking the public URL as a script src, but works fine as inline script? Thanks for your time!\n(Let me know if I should ask this in another channel, too.)",
