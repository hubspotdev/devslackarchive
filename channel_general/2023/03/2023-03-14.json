They're just properties that would only be used on the preview case study grid, not part of the content of the page itself.\n\nI could create a hubdb table to hold the extra information and then put the link to the full page in the table, but I'd then be editing content in two places, and have to pull out the data from both the page and hubdb to render the feature grid.\n\nIs there a general approach for where you want to feature content from other pages on a different page?"
