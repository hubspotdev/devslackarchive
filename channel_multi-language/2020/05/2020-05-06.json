    "text": "Hi Bayram! I’m not sure I follow — it sounds like you have two brand domains, each with their own language, right?\nTechnically, you can make a template multi-language, but it might be easier to have separate templates, especially if there’s any other variation (such as layout, logo, etc).\nI’d be interested in learning more about your setup, and I could get more specific if we can look at an example. Could you send me an email so we can connect? <mailto:svalsdottir@HubSpot.com|svalsdottir@HubSpot.com>"
