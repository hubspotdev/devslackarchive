    "text": "Hi everyone! I've been working on adding the tracking code to our platform so that users get identified to HubSpot with their e-mails after logging in and so that we can send them directed CTAs using segmentation lists. We have successfully added the tracking code and we can confirm,  by looking at the requests that are sent to HubSpot from the browser, that the e-mails are being correctly sent to HubSpot.\n\nHowever, the CTAs are presenting a strange behaviour. Sometimes they will show up right after the identification with the tracking code, but sometimes they will take very long to show or will never show (after ~5 min.). Using the same login, same browser and same settings we've seen some cases in which in a first logins the CTAs never show up, then after some retries (with new cookies, using the anonymous tab), the CTAs start showing up, but then after some other retries they stop showing up again, even with the CTA configured to always repeat and to show after 1 second in the page.\n\nCan you please help me to understand if this behaviour could be caused by something we've been doing wrong? We've already read the docs (<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/reports/install-the-HubSpot-tracking-code>) many times and can't figure it out."

Using a free HubSpot seat with no record access and having them connect their calendars isn't an option until we get the ability to create custom user properties - the scheduling needs to take into account things like skill level and YoE.",
