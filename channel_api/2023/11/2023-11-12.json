It sounds like the operation the right object key/val you’re looking for would be:\n`importOperations: {\"0-1\": \"UPSERT\"}`\n\nHowever, if you’re looking to have the operation decided based on email (opposed to record ID), I think you’ll want to make sure to set the `columnType`  parameter on the email column/object to `\"HubSpot_ALTERNATE_ID\"` .\n\nMight want to consider using one of the legacy endpoints as well, tailor made for contact upserts, depending on the specifics of your situation: <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/batch_create_or_update>"
