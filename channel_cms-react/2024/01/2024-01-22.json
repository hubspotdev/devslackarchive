So to make GraphQL calls from the browser, you really should wrap it with a serverless function (or some other BE endpoint that makes the GraphQL API call).\n\nA little more on that from:\n\n<https://github.HubSpot.com/cms-js-building-block-examples/reference/data-fetching.html#HubSpot-content-client-side>\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/query-HubSpot-data-using-graphql#scope-requirements>"

I use a “regular” (so, not in a project) serverless function which makes the API call using the Private App token taken from process.env. Then in my project (Island) I call the public endpoint (not the collector as I wrongly pasted above) and I get the CORS error.\n\nIn the meantime, I’ve deployed the project and in production it’s working fine. When the user selects a country from a dropdown, I get the correct response."

We have a favor to ask of you… when you get a chance could you fill out our <https://app.opinionx.co/77cb0d81-9d9b-41e6-ab78-f9c10fadd601|survey on how you'd like us to change/improve JS building blocks>? Many of you have give us lovely feedback and this is our request for a bit more. The survey should only take a few minutes of your time and will be very helpful for us to prioritize our efforts this year.\n\nThe main part of the survey is “stack ranking” a list of potential features &amp; changes, which will not only let us know which things you are interested in but also the _order_ of your preference/importance. Also, there there is an optional free form input to call out other requests we didn’t include on our list (and another optional place for comments and other general feedback if you’d like to send them our way).\n\nThanks again!"
