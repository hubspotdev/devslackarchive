We haven't received any feedback yet and would really appreciate your insights or suggestions on how to resolve this. Has anyone else faced similar issues or found a workaround?\n\nAlso, is there a *Discord* community for HubSpot? If so, please let us know.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!"

It would be a great help and we could capitalize on HubSpot. I can't find any process or solution online please.\n\nThanks for your help"
