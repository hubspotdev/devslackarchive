    "text": "heard back from Steven:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi AJ, the ‘blog_post_ids’ parameter is given so that you can manually choose which blog_post to find find related posts for. A good example is if you have a landing page where you want to show blog posts that are related to a specific post you want. If you pass values to ‘blog_post_ids’ on a blog_post page, the widget will also find posts related to the given ‘blog_post_ids’ instead of the blog_post for the page - so it can act a sort of override. Does that makes sense?"
