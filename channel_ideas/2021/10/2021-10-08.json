That way we could have less complexity and more efficiency. The Module Partials could look the same as normal Modules. Then inside of a real module, one could  \"import\" those partials.\n\nThe Module Partials would not be exposed to the Editor, only the Modules itself.",

    "text": "Hello everyone! Our team is trying to get some support for a couple feature requests to help our clients.\n\n*1. Allowing required fields in HubDB:*\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Allow-Required-DB-Fields/idi-p/491163>\n\n*2. Localization of datetime fields in HubDB:*\nCurrently HubDB datetime fields are all set to UTC-0. This isn't a problem when you are only working with one time zone, but in instances where you need to specifically notate multiple timezones, this requires our clients to do timezone math to figure out what time their event would be in UTC-0 time. If we could localize datetime fields directly in HubDB this would never be an issue.\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Allow-Localization-for-DateTime-Columns-in-HubDB/idi-p/491073>\n\nI appreciate everyone who takes the time to look at these issues and upvote them, we just want to make HubSpot better so more and more folks want to use it and _keep_ using it in the future"

For the most part Macro files can be used to construct relatively dynamic html structures with variables that can be fed into configured spots from fields. CSS can also be conditionally imported into modules from those macro files.\n\nThe thing that would really be helpful here would be creating reusable field.json sections.\n\nIf youre using webpack for any of your HubSpot builds - my team has actually recently created a plugin that will allow you to leverage componentized json that you can import into any module.\n\n<https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jazzyclimber/parachute>"
