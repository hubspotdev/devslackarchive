As a workaround, if you clone the first slide then go in and edit it, you will be able to add images.\n\nAlso, the image gallery module works as intended from a page perspective, it seems the design manager is the only place where this should be happening. Ill continue to keep you updated but please feel free to use the workaround above in the meantime.\n\nIf you have any questions please let me know."

Once I have the templates, modules, coded files, etc., do I just edit them as is? Can I rename them for the specific project? Do I clone them first? I’ve always started my templates from scratch before. Thanks!"
