    "text": "Hey all. I'm in the middle of a custom HubSpot CMS build out (my first) and I'm running into an issue with the Link field type. It appears that the snippet for this field type is incomplete, as it doesn't render an href for users who add a \"Content\" link. This seems like basic functionality for a link field, so this really caught me off guard. This field type is used extensively throughout my project and we are close to launch. How are people handling this in the community? I thought I had a solution by using the following snippet:\n `{% if module.more_link.url.type is equalto \"CONTENT\" %}`\n              `{% set contentURL = content_by_id(module.more_link.url.content_id) %}`\n              `{% set href = contentURL.absolute_url %}`\n   `{% endif %}`"

    "text": "In researching this, I've become aware of a workaround people are using with the content_by_ids() function - grouping all of their ids into an array and passing that in then parsing the results. This does not seem like a great solution either. That function also has a limit of 10 calls per page, and when using multiple modules on a page with that field type, one can easily surpass that limit."
