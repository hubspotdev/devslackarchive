Thanks for tagging me in, <@UCGBUH5TM>!\n\nThe validation steps outlined in this article (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/faq/how-does-HubSpot-validate-email-addresses>) and expanded upon in this thread (<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Inconsistent-email-validation-using-Forms-API/m-p/229191>) are not new, however the team continues to iterate on and improve their implementation.\n\nDespite these checks, it is still very much possible for a “fake” email addresses like <mailto:xyz@abc.com|xyz@abc.com> to enter a HubSpot account if they pass checks 1-4. Due to accuracy concerns, we no longer use Strikeiron.\n\nAt this time, I’m not aware of an out-of-the-box integration which validates email addresses before they are submitted through HubSpot forms or the Forms API. One alternative may be to use HubSpot’s global form events (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/global-form-events>, <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Form-Email-Validation-Block-all-providers-except-one/m-p/266350>) to fire your own validation or call an external service like mailboxlayer (<https://mailboxlayer.com/>)."
