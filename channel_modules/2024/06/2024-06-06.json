    "text": "If you have a field named 'contact' in a module (which is allowed), HubSpot's prerendering feature won't work. This is because HubSpot mistakenly interprets {{ module.contact }} or {{ module.anything.contact }} as a global \"contact\" variable, even though it's a module field. When you check the page source code with ?hsDebugOnly=true, you'll see this message:\n\n\"This page currently CANNOT be prerendered. To improve your site speed and user experience, address the following issue(s): This page uses an uncachable value. ([value contact])\"\n\nIdeally, module fields shouldn't be considered for this, regardless of their names (see: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/cdn/prerendering#hubl-variables>).\n\nThis is something to keep in mind when developing modules for HubSpot. Ideally, this would be fixed on HubSpot's end.",
