    "text": "Hi Carter, this field seems to be working on my end... Are you certain there is actually data populated in that property for the object returned?\n\nIt's my understanding (though I'm not 100% sure so don't quote me on this :stuck_out_tongue:) that `hs_activity_type` contains custom types set up in your HubSpot account, see documentation for <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/calls|Calls> and <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/meetings|Meetings> where it describes that property under the `Create a...` sections in those articles.\n\nIf you're looking generally for the type of engagement (`CALL`, `MEETING`, etc.), that seems to be available under `hs_engagement_type`"
