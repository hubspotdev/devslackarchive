This API supports OAuth 2.0 authentication and you can find more details at <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/auth/oauth-overview>\",\"correlationId\":\"xxxxx\",\"category\":\"INVALID_AUTHENTICATION\"}```\nThe weird thing is that it was working the exact same way on the previous HS portal.\nAnyone has ever encountered this?",

I thought based on <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/cdn#image-compression-optimization-and-automatic-resizing> that the files just needed to be uploaded to the file manager and then I could do something like this `&lt;img src=\"<https://www.mysite.com/hubfs/image.jpg?width=300>\" width=\"300\"&gt;`  but I just get the full size image constrained to that size. Is there a way to actually use the CDN or does the page have to be hosted by HubSpot?"

    "text": "Hi guys!\nDuring the last week I am having problems with the API when I try to get the companies.\nI have built an incremental pipeline with python API, searching only the companies with the lastmodifieddate greater than my current one storaged in my database.\n\nOnce a week we make a total load and the last Sunday we realized that we have much less records. Testing the code and  reviewing the outputs we saw that the filters are not working well for companies.\n\nWe have a search by lastmodifieddate order by lastmodifieddate and the results are usually ordered but in some outputs we have a recent value with the current date and after that record, everything continues normal.\n\nExample:\n\nRecord1 -&gt; 2022-01-01 15:40\nRecord2 -&gt; 2022-01-01 18:40\nRecord3 -&gt; 2022-01-01 21:40\nRecord4 -&gt; 2024-02-21 10:40\nRecord5 -&gt; 2022-01-01 23:40\nRecord6 -&gt; 2022-01-02 00:40\n\nIt is only happening with Companies. With other objects like Tickets, contacts or Deals it works perfectly.\n\nIt is a function code example:\n```public_object_search_request = (\n            self.HubSpot_crm_mod.PublicObjectSearchRequest(\n                properties=self.properties,\n                limit=self.page_size,\n                filter_groups=filter_groups,\n                sorts=[\n                    {\n                        \"propertyName\": self.internal_id,\n                        \"direction\": \"ASCENDING\",\n                    }\n                ],\n            )\n        )\n\nsearch_api.do_search(public_object_search_request=public_object_search_request)```\nIt looks like sort function is not working properly to companies.\n\nSomeone has idea if there is a new bug or something?\n\nThanks for your attention!"
