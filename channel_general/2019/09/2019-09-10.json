    "text": "Great. The old classes are added again when the article gets updated (I just pushed the update button, nothing else). But because the new class adds inline styles, we need to override them with !important. It is not pretty but solves the issue. We still need to update our base CSS. It's manageable, but still... :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nConclusion:\nWe need to keep a mix of old and new classes to \"save\" the video styles for articles that were published before 2019-09.\n\nSuggestion:\nIf it's technically possible, do not add inline styles, instead add them via HubSpot's recommended/responsive CSS. Then we can decide if we want to include them or use our own CSS and apply styles to the class names."

    "text": "Hey Benjamin,\n\nWe specifically chose to migrate from relying on CSS template class CSS to inline styles for responsiveness because not all customers may have the template CSS available, it’s harder to update template level CSS across customers in the case we need to change something, and by using inline styles the video responsiveness becomes WYSIWYG in the editor which is a big plus for content creators. So unfortunately we can’t strip out those inline styles.\n\nIt looks like the CSS you’re adding with `!important` can actually be accomplished by selecting the `Full width` option in the embed video plugin in the Rich text inline popovers (this will set the videos to be 100% width). I would strongly suggest using the functionality built into the embed plugin. This way you don’t need to add\n\n```\n.hs-responsive-embed-wrapper {\n    min-height: auto !important;\n    max-height: 100% !important;\n    max-width: 100% !important;\n    min-width: 100% !important;\n    padding: 0 !important;\n}\n```\n\nFrom dev tool investigation of your blog page in question, it looks to me like the only problematic CSS style is `margin: 45px auto 60px` hooked into the `.hs-responsive-embed` classname because we are setting the inline styles to be `margin: 0 auto`. Right now, if the content creator adds specific spacing using the embed plugin popover those will be overridden by your CSS class because of the `!important` flag, which might confuse the content creators and force them to ask devs to change the CSS classes or understand how CSS specificity works themselves (which they shouldn’t have to). We are investigating a way to _not_ set the margin inline styles unless the values have been explicitly changed which will enable you to _remove_ the !important from the margin. This will let the class-level CSS kick in if nothing was set by the content creator, otherwise the content creator can specifically set margins themselves without trouble.\n\nHow does this sound to you?"
