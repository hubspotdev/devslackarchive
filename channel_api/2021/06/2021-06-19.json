    "text": "Hey - it depends on what it is you want to do and the type of integration. Key things to get started:\n\n1. Get a sandbox account (<https://offers.HubSpot.com/free-cms-developer-sandbox>)\n2. Decide on authentication method - API key vs oAuth. API key is the quickest way and has to be used for certain implementations. It’s essentially a super admin key. For oAuth you need to jump through the oAuth application flow (you can create and app in your developer account.)\n3. Pick one of the v3 (recommended) libraries - <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/overview>\n4. Read up on the CRM objects\n5. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/understanding-the-crm>\n6. Use the deals endpoint - <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/deals> (click the “Endpoints” tab."
