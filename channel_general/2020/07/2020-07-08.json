I've heard that there were some changes in the HubSpot CMS.\nI would like to have your feedback on few points concerning HubSpot.\n1/ Is it possible to integrate Bitbucket in HubSpot?\n2/ Is it possible to have an auto-deployment in HubSpot (pushing stuff that are deployed automatically into the CMS)\n3/ Is it possible to set some limits in the texteditors like avoiding clients to change the font-family or size for exemple. Perfect would be to be able to work with CSS-Classes like a CKEditor would do.",
