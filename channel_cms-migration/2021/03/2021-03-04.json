    "text": "Hey folks, a client is looking to migrate their CRM data from two different HubSpot portals that satellite offices have been using into a single HS portal at their HQ location. I was curious if there are options available that would allow immutable timeline data (activities, events, etc.) to be transferred into the destination environment. I figure that since the source and destination's systems are the same, there may be some option there?\n\nIt would make sense to me if things like analytics events cannot be transferred because they're produced from a different portal's analytics.js, but what about tasks and communications?\n\napologies in advance if I'm posting in the wrong channel, thanks!",
