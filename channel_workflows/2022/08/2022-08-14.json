    "text": "I have a question about documentation and what to keep an eye on. I noticed over the past 48H that the way in which headers are sent to webhooks from signed workflows (version 3 signatures) has changed. For example, the timestamp and signature used to be in \"multiValueHeaders\" and now it just moved to \"headers\". The header keys also became all small caps (like X-HubSpot-Request-Timestamp became x-HubSpot-request-timestamp). My question is : where can we read about these changes in advance so that we don't have to discover them when errors occur down the line and code breaks."
