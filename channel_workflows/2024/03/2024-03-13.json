Just as an FYI, I am a HubSpot lead and developer of the Workflows FE team and this was my ask of the greater community to get feedback on a potential new feature. We’re always on the lookout for ways to solve problems for our customers and given the “learn how to use the Workflows tool” issue has been around for years, we were looking for creative solutions. Templates didn’t have the intended outcome we hoped for, therefore we’re looking for alternatives"

Is this something about API rate limit, or maybe just HubSpot side?\nIt says, Custom code wasn't able to execute, but will retry soon. The WF was run about 4 hrs ago, still the result I'm expecting is not updated. Any help or inputs would be appreciated.",

This is because the code-action is a scaled service and it processes multiple requests using Lambda services and when the workflow scales up, your API request limit per / 10 seconds is reached.\n\nThe good news is that it will retry based on the \"Event\" details but will retry for up to 3-days.\n\nThe work around to leverage Zapier could work but introduces another layer / costs that you'll have to evaluate.\n\nMy suggestion is to run the code externally once and get the data you need for the deals you have in the system and then enable the workflow to be triggered on events moving forward.\n\nI'm going to think on a way to leverage dynamic lists to help with bulk enrollment and maybe there is a way to create a \"queue\"-like system within HubSpot that mirrors the Zapier solution."

    "text": "I’ve gone through the same thing and I did a branch.. and added a delay to each branch before it hit the CCA.. it helped with 40k records enrolled, so like 5 branches, wait 5 mins increments (branch 1, no delay, branch 2, 5 mins delay, branch 3, 10 mins delay etc). And since every private api key has it’s own rate limit, I had multiple steps hitting HubSpot API, I created two and seperated what they had access to. One CCA used one private app, and then next one used another. This lowered the number of retries, it’s bulky but offers a kind of queue too.",
