I am not able to pass dynamic context into a query. I was able to build dynamic pages and use the dynamic object CRM method, but I need to use GraphQl to get associations, and I am not able to do that.\n\nAt this time, I am only able to successfully bind GraphQL queries with collections only and hardcoded filters."
