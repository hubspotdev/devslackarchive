    "text": "Hi everyone! I am a complete newbie and I am looking for some leading or advice, on where to start. I have experience with html, css and js. Recently as a frontend beginner, I found a job, they already have their content existing. Now I try to get familiar with HubSpot and Hubl as a language to write. Do you have any suggestions on how to start? Or where to find examples I can work with?\n\nI already am watching some tutorials and reading content from HS web. That's how I also found this forum.\n\nThank you for all your answers!",

I worked with js, or markup languages in VS like XML or JSON-LD, but this doesn't make sense for me, not yet. I don't know how to imagine or connect it so I would create the needed content. How to connect it to the css styles and stuff like that, what you do in &lt;head&gt; or &lt;meta&gt;, could you maybe advise me where to find leading for it? reading, a course, basically anything would be great!"
