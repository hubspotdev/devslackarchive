    "text": "so far, we actually havent seen any difference in engagement between SS sends and HubSpot sends.

To be fair to SS, our list sends are only 5k to 10k each time, so it's not the biggest population size. I'll hopefully have more information in the coming weeks since someone is working on a full analysis"
