    "text": "Hello,\n\nWhat is your experience, what is the expected average response time of a HubSpot serverless feature?\nI ask because we are experiencing that a simple serverless function (which only has one response) is 400-600ms.\nA function that includes a HubDB call is 2 seconds.\nFor a payment process where we need to send 3-4 API requests in a serverless function, it takes 7 seconds.\nIf we build our own nodejs server, the same calls total 700ms.\nOur question is how to speed up the response time of serverless function?\n\nThanks!"
