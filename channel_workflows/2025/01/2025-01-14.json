For example, if the sequence name is the same as the business campaign name (which is a custom object), I want to copy the Total Enrollments number into the 'Numbers Enrollments' field in the matching business campaign.\nIs it possible to do this through Workflow, with code, directly through HubSpot, or would I need to use an external tool like Make?\nThanks in advance!",
