    "text": "Similar to David's previous request, I'm having a little trouble creating objects in the v3 API. (Yes, I know I could use an older version, but I'm trying to use the new one!)\n\nIn this case, I'm trying to create a company record for `Test Co.`. So if I'm understanding the docs correctly, I'd want to pass JSON that looks like this to the API:\n\n```{\n\t\"properties\": {\n\t\t\"name\": \"Test Co.\"\n\t}\n}```\nHowever, my requests fail and this is the error returned:\n```{\n    \"status\": \"error\",\n\t\"message\": \"Invalid input JSON on line 1, column 15: Cannot deserialize instance of `java.util.HashSet` out of START_OBJECT token\",\n\t\"correlationId\": (redacted),\n\t\"requestId\": (redacted)\n}```\nAm I missing something here?",
