    "text": "Hi everyone, we are seeing an issue where sometimes Googleâ€™s search result snippet is using the wrong content for the description. In this instance, we have a blog post which embeds a Youtube video. While we have a description meta tag in our page head, sometimes Google is preferring to use the Youtube channel uploader attribution. However, this is not always the case. It seems sort of random to us because Google will show a different description for the same article depending on the search query. Please see the attached images. The 2nd, larger image, it the correct content.\n\nThe page in question is:\n<https://www.preventivevet.com/dogs/why-is-your-dog-barking>\n\nIs there a way we can prevent Google from using the Youtube video information?",
