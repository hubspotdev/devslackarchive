These contacts' email addresses get updated on login.\n\nThe problem is that, even though I've manually opted out those personal emails, they still get sent as our newsletter is sent as transnational.\n\nIs there any way to ensure that a user's primary email address doesn't change? Ex, if both are on their record and I make the correct one the \"primary\" one and they log in again...can I ensure that we don't email that personal email address?",
