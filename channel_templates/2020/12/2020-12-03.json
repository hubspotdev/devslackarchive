    "text": "Hi all - I had a page <https://www.geoamps.com/demo|Demo | GeoAMPS> with an old template so I changed it to a new template. However, even though I see the new look - there are some external CSS files that neither in the header nor in the footer but still it is impacting the CTA button on the page. Here is the CSS file that I am referring to <https://www.geoamps.com/hs-fs/hub/432151/hub_generated/template_assets/2022801574/1578803976880/Coded_files/Custom/page/Geoamps_Nov2014-theme/Geoamps_Nov2014-style.css|https://www.geoamps.com/hs-fs/hub/432151/hub_generated/template_assets/2022801574/15[â€¦]s/Custom/page/Geoamps_Nov2014-theme/Geoamps_Nov2014-style.css> . So can any one help how to identify why this taking that CSS file?",
