Obviously also a huge GDPR issue too.\n\nIf you do get somewhere though it would be good to know what you ended up doing"

One of the blockers is that they have become big fans of the possibility to write IF statements directly in them template. I know that you can do smart content but this is very time consuming and we don't have any access controls over lists. Do you know if you can do something similar in HubSpot?",
