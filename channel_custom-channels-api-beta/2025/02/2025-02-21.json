To group messages, I use the `integrationThreadId`, which works as expected.\n\nHowever, I want to ensure that if a user starts a conversation through another channel (e.g., by sending a support request via email), they can continue the same thread within our dashboard (the external service).\n\nIs there a way to achieve this?",
