    "text": "Hi all, got a question related to breadcrumbs. We currently have a custom module for our breadcrumbs with a repeater field. In the repeater field, you can select a page with the page field, I then grab the absolute_url, name etc. to display in the breadcrumb. Each item from the repeater is shown as a ‘parent’ for the current page. But if we update or move one of these parent pages, we have to manually update all breadcrumbs. Is there a better way to handle breadcrumbs when we have multiple parent pages?\nI was currently thinking of grabbing the URL and splitting the URL to get the parent pages, but sadly, there is not function available to get the page info based on the slug (something like `content_by_slug(slug)`.)"
