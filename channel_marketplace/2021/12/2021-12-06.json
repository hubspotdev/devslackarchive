    "text": "That would be the ideal customer solution. The reason for the guideline is because customers can easily delete content from an RTE and there isn't an easy way to revert those changes. For example, if a developer created a button using classes within the RTE, and then a customer deleted that button (perhaps while trying to modify the button text), there wouldn't be an easy path to reverting or understanding what the classes are.\nAs for using TinyMCE - I believe that HubSpot is using the library for all of their RTE instances, but opening up options where a user can define content within the editor could lead to security risks like xss, etc."
