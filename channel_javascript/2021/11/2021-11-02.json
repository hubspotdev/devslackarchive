    "text": "Hello everyone. I have developed a custom conditional multistep form which submits to HubSpot all necessary fields and also after the final submission depending on what the user has chosen on a radio list options he gets redirected to schedule a meeting page in a new tab (and also in the thank you page that i receive by the HubSpot form) where i pass his information via URL in order to autopopulate the meeting form with what he previously filled.\n\nThe strange thing is that there are many cases that the user's first name and last name are twisted which causes problem in the mailing campaigns that are triggered afterwards as we refer to the user by his last name and not first and also causes problem to our call center as they manually have to correct hundreds of contacts.\n\nI have tried to reproduce the issue but i had no luck and everything is passing through correctly.\n\nI attach the function that i create the redirection url :\n```// Function that checks redirect conditions \nfunction appointmentUrlField() {\n\n  if ((fundingCheck !== \"I have money\") || (timeCommitmentCheck !== \"Yes\")) {\n    console.log(\"NO APPOINTMENT\");\n    return\n  } else {\n    if ($(form).valid() === true) {\n      console.log(\"YES APPOINTMENT\");\n      var url = \"<https://meetings.HubSpot.com/tkeck/become-a-dealer>\";\n      var appointFname = \"?firstname=\" + document.getElementById(\"hs-main-form\").querySelector(\"input[name='firstname']\").value;\n      var appointLname = \"&amp;lastname=\" + document.getElementById(\"hs-main-form\").querySelector(\"input[name='lastname']\").value;\n      var appointEmail = \"&amp;email=\" + document.getElementById(\"hs-main-form\").querySelector(\"input[name='email']\").value;\n      var appointPhone = \"&amp;phone=\" + document.getElementById(\"hs-main-form\").querySelector(\"input[name='phone']\").value.replace(/[^\\d]/g, \"\");\n      var fUrlValues = url + appointFname + appointLname + appointEmail + appointPhone;\n      window.open(fUrlValues, \"_blank\");\n    }\n  }\n}\n// Function that checks redirect conditions ```\nI also attach the html code : for the Book a Meeting Button\n```&lt;button type=\"button\" id=\"\" name=\"next\" onclick=\"appointmentUrlField()\" class=\"btn-submit btn-step next\"&gt;Book a Meeting&lt;/button&gt;```\nPlease let me know if there is anything that escapes my attention.\n\nThank you very much",

    "text": "Operations Hub - Using Custom Code Feature - When using the feature, you have to set outputs at the bottom in order to use/reference the variables in other parts of the workflow. However, once you initially add and save your outputs, you CANNOT go back and edit the without the whole feature erroring out and erasing all of your output fields. Thus, you have to redo them all from scratch, as well as any other parts of your workflow that reference these now missing outputs. Anyone else experiencing this issue?"
