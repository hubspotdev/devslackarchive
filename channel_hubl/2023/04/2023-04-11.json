    "text": "HI team, I have a specific cell in one of my HubDB tables that I want to display in an email. I am able to do this quite easily as shown below.\n\nTake advantage of our Auto Loan Financing. Rate = {{ hubdb_table_rows('6110808', 'name=Auto+Loans')[0][2] }} and now is the time to buy.\n\nIt shows the correct rate from the HubDB table. Is it possible to tokenize this in anyways? General staff users cannot code this every time they setup various emails for other rates. I did try a module but that is not inline text with the marketing statement. Any ideas?",
