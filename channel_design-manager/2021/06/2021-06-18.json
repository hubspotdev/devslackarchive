    "text": "It's quite a debate I would say. Many folks are saying \"import the JS in the module\" others say \"import all js always. Since if you load a specific js it requires a new request\". From my experience it's better to load all js at once in for instance the base.html(or similar; which should always be a base for ALL of your templates) of your theme. By doing so you can have/optimize the loading order if there are dependencies. "

    "text": "I think if you are doing preconnects or dns fetches, and you are loading each script individually, the REAL WORLD tests prove that smaller scripts and more of them is faster than one long script. The amount of sockets open arenâ€™t emulated in testing to show what real life performance is.\n\nThis is my opinion above based on how I feel.. I do believe it is highly debatable.
