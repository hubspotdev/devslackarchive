    "text": "Hello, we’d like to implement HubSpot with a new B2C client but we don’t have a lot of IT capacity for us to make the implementation through API calls, so we’d like to know the opportunities available if we implement the user’s ecommerce journey into HubSpot via only the HubSpot tracking code. The idea is to collect users’ data, to then import them to HubSpot, add them to a workflow and start sending them emails to follow up with them. Some of the questions I have are: - by using the HubSpot tracking code, will we be able to track what pages each user has visited and which ones he hasn’t? - will we be able to add a button in the email that will take them back to the page where they left off, in a way that they don’t have to input all the previous data from the pages before? Thanks a lot in advance!",
