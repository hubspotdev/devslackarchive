    "text": "Hi <@U037ZPYEGAF> I checked with our team again and this is where we are with this feature:\n\nDue to our addition of language translation, all strings have to run through our translation service which by default will scan for new labels every 10 to 15 minutes. This is why the untranslated labels take about this long for you to see them. It then takes 2 to 3 days for our translation team to get those labels in every other language.\n\nWe’re working on cleaning up this process so that the untranslated labels can appear faster, but so far this is the SLA we hold ourselves to"
