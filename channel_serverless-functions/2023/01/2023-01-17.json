    "text": "Sorry for the late reply — thanks for the insight Curtis! My original question was not specific to one specific type of serverless function. I’m curious as to any shortcuts you’ve found to make serverless function development more efficient. Are you making edits in Design Manager or locally? How do you find that process to be working for you?"

    "text": "Ohhhh, yeah definitely tripped me up there with CI/CD flow state vs Development Approach with Serverless.\n\nDevelopment is tricky. Not going to sugar coat that. My best advise is you need to emulate your production architecture locally or literally run production replica architecture copies directly in AWS as your development environment. There are always snags between the two.\n\nI like to integrate my IDE directly in with AWS, and develop / push all my changes locally, while having tests that I can quickly run against the updates.\n\nThe question is, how big is your team? Stages in API Gateway can make things nice, but if you're talking with a team of 10+ engineers that could get out of hand fast."
