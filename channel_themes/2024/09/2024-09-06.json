    "text": "Hi all,\nis there a way to define the color for a dnd_section (via editor AND via coded HTML Template for a section)?\nPreviously it was possible (and <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/tags/dnd-areas|documentation> still doesn't state otherwise) to define an `backgorund_image`\n AND a `background_color` . This has changed at some point - leaving already defined sections with unintended issues - which are HARD to come by.\nTo be honest it is a brute-force Method (and from dev-perspective an incorrect one) to add a linear-gradient for plain background-coloring.\nIt is understandable - yet also against proper work - to set this with !important. Just lucky it is not added inline on the section.\n\nThe suggested workaround (<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/How-do-I-customize-a-section-background-color-along-with/m-p/700448#M30684>) via adding a class on section is not flexible - there is no adjustment possible after adding the section.\nThe only (plausible and controlled) way would  be providing a range of classnames as a developer for a section (from which the editor can choose from.\nOr simply enable setting of a color on section-level - or at least a toggle for light or dark coloring.\nEither of theses suggested options would help massively (and get rid of dubious workarounds).\n\nAnd of course: would be nice to update the Documentation so that is clear that you only can add a `backgorund_image` , a `background_color`  OR a `background_gradient`."
