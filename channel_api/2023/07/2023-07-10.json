The form currently creates a contact while being vetted, and then a deal is created and either accepted or rejected.\nWe are interested in finding a way to push the form-filled data to our API once the deal is accepted. The data we would like to push includes fields such as Name, Collection Location, Delivery Location, Vehicle, and potential Price.\nOur goal is to streamline the booking process by integrating their HubSpot form with our booking system.\nIf anyone has any thoughts or insights on how we can achieve this integration, I would greatly appreciate your input.",
