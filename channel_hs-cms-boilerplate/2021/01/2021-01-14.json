    "text": "Hi all! I’m running into a strange error when trying to upload a custom module from my React App Boilerplate. The error is `main.min.js:350 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token` Upon closer inspection it seems like its failing on the final line (line 350)   `\\\\# sourceURL=<https://f.HubSpotusercontent00.net/hubfs/{HubSpotID}/raw_assets/public/{HubSpotFolder}/main.js>` I’m assuming that is meant to be a commented out line and it’s failing on the first character?\nHas anyone seen this before? Since main.min.js is an autogenerated file I’m not sure how to best solve this issue.",
