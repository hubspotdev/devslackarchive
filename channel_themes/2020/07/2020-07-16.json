    "text": "HS THEME BUG: When Cloning a theme.\n\nJust a quick heads up on a repeatable bug that I've noticed when cloning a theme.  The various URL paths don't seem to be \"connecting\" correctly even though the path is right.  For example, below...\n\n`{% extends \"./layouts/base.html\" %}`\n\nThis is the correct path, however the system throws a warning.  As a result in the CMS, many of the features (drag-n-drop) don't work.  To correct this I had to go in and make a subtle change the to the file then PUBLISH, revert that change, and PUBLISH again.\n\nThen the warning disappeared and the Theme worked as normal in the CMS.\n\nLet me know if you need more details.",
