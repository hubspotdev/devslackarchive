    "text": "Hey all, I have a React app essentially built, but was done entirely through local development. The “How to use JavaScript frameworks on HubSpot” documentation really only offers the react boilerplate as a deployment solution, and I’d like to avoid going through another create-react-app and transposing everything from my current directory into that one. Assuming I need to adapt my build, how/in what ways would I need to adapt my build to make it deployable on HubSpot CMS?"

    "text": "<@U01D9RNG540> without knowing how your project is setup it’s hard to give you a specific answer but you can take a look at the npm scripts the boilerplate is using to handle the deploy here <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react-boilerplate#packagejson-scripts>. The `deploy` script is uploads the `/dist` directory via the HubSpot CLI `upload` command, which you can read more about here <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/local-development-cms-cli#upload>"
