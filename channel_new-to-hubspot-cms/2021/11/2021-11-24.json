As a result, I’m trying to identify possible technical challenges related to using HubSpot. I know it’s a strange question to ask, but could you please share any experiences you have related to things like parallax, scroll-based animations, trigger based svg-animations, generative patterns and so on? Basically anything “special” that could be challenging to do in HubSpot CMS. Thanks!"
