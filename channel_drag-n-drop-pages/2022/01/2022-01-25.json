    "text": "Hey, all. What’s the best way to make a simple narrow column within the DnD builder? Say my default 12-column container is 1200px wide. A single column in that container is a bit wide for readability, and I’d prefer say, 800px wide instead. Sans-DnD I would set `max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;` on my container. However with DnD I’m unsure of the best approach. Offets? Spacers? Keeping responsiveness in mind as well.",
