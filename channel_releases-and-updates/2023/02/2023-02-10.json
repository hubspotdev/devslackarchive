    "text": "I’m also adding my 2 cents here since it’s sensitive topic for me. My primary focus is creating themes for HubSpot platform. Frankly, these new requirements feel off. As <@U39DT5YFL> said\n&gt; I don’t really get why theme requirements are dictating how we set up our fields. It won’t always make sense to keep those field types in the style tab.\nDifferent developers and teams have their unique approaches to building themes. Now we are moving to standardization of the process that would limit creativity and lead to everyone being the same on the marketplace. So what’s the point of different creators on the marketplace, then?\n\nCurrently, CMS has its benefits and limitations compared to other site builders based on predefined themes. Because of those limitations, dev teams came up with their own workarounds to get the desired results despite the obstacles. This is where repeaters are a great example. So why is HubSpot trying to limit creators even more with stricter requirements for organizing the stuff inside the theme without addressing the issues that made creators organize the way they organize right now?\n\n<@U2H3TT8F2> would be great to hear some more info on the reasoning behind these exact changes regarding modules and fields. Thanks!"
