    "text": "Hi, We are getting this error message while trying to use the \"Create Email Template\" endpoint.\n\"This oauth-token (XXX) does not have proper permissions! (requires any of [design-manager-access])\"\nOAuth token has access to the following scopes \"content\", \"contact\" and \"OAuth\".\nWhen we try to GET the EmailTemplates, it doesn't throw any error. Its happening only in POST EmailTemplate action when we are using it in API to push content to HubSpot. We have the required scopes/permissions defined as well. Any idea what is causing this and how to resolve? I cannot see the design manager scope in the available scopes in my app connector. Is it only available in paid accounts?"
