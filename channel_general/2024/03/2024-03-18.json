I've always relied on this functionality, super useful, but now it seems broken to me.",

The color/style I have set up in the \"Theme\" for the blog post links does not show up on the different section backgrounds I have designed for the main website pages. So I have set up a few different classes to use on the main website pages depending on the color background but I am wondering what creative way you have used to make it obvious a headline is a link - other than an underline."
