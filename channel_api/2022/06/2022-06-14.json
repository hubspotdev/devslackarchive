The answer to this question is yes, you may check this link to learn more about \"CRM Integration\".\n<https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/guides/crm-integration>\nSet Up Your CRM for Conversion Leads\n<https://www.facebook.com/business/help/279369167153556>\n• I just chated with HS Support and the answer was - it seems like offline conversion events are indeed not the easiest for Facebook to ingest and they do require some form of custom integration\nDoes anyone have experiance with such integration and can help me get things working?"
