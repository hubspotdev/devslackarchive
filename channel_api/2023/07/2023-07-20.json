I’m probably missing something, but there’s nothing that connects the two: nothing in `deals` points to what company made that deal - I’d expect there would be something.\n\nI am using\n```client.crm.objects.get_all(event_type, properties=properties)```\nwhere `event_type` is either ‘companies’ or ‘deals’, and `properties` are all relevant properties that I’m getting with\n```client.crm.properties.core_api.get_all(event_type)```\nso that I also have the expanded user-defined ones.\n\nAgain, not seeing a field that connects between the two collections.\n\nAny knowledgable savior to the rescue?
