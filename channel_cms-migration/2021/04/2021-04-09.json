Does anyone know a way, a script for instance, to transfer blog content from Wordpress to HubSpot? I have given this one a try: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/blog/import-your-wordpress-blog-into-HubSpot> , but the content wont display in my blog post (only metadata) - possibly because the Wordpress blog is also custom made and does not include main content in the post body.",
