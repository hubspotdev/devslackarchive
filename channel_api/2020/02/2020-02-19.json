Once I have the lines, I use the line endpoint to get each line. But some of the results have the \"properties\" field empty (found out that was the products not in library) and some only have the \"product id\" and not the quantity. Am I doing something wrong? *EDIT: Found out! My bad! Needed to add the properties to the url as get params (as it says in the docs)*"
