(<http://forms.hsforms.com|forms.hsforms.com>)\nDue to restrictions for our audience, I'm probably be able to whitelist our landing page domain (<http://x.mydomain.com|x.mydomain.com>) but not the HubSpot domain (<http://forms.hsforms.com|forms.hsforms.com>, which would also be a maintenance burden/hazard)\nIs there anything I can do to make the form post within the original domain?",
