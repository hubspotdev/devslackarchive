    "text": "Hello,\n\nIt seems this might be the right spot for this question. \n\nI’m looking for help/advice from anyone who has done A/B testing with entire workflows. \n\nWe’re working on a test where we’re looking to split a list in two and provide one half a series of emails that includes a discount code and the other half the same series of emails without a code to measure any lift in our CRM/data wharehouse/Tableau.\n\nIn part I believe we’d follow this example <https://blog.HubSpot.com/customers/how-to-a/b-test-workflow-emails-using-the-lead-rotator-or-zapier>\n\nWe don’t really use contact owners so the concept of custom contact owners is also a bit foreign to us.\n\nDo you happen to have any resources related to or know anyone who has experience using Lead Rotator in this way?"
