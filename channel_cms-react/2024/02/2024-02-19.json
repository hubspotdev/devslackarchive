    "text": "Hi is it possible to import an island inside another island?\n\nI have an island 'mother' that imports a JS modal from /modules and I wish to render another island 'child' inside my JS modal.\n\nAssume a react page (mother island) which needs to render a signup island inside a modal.\nMy simplified code looks more or less the following:\n\n```import { Component as Signup } from './../../../../modules/Signup';  // Signup is defined in /islands\nimport { Component as Modal } from './../../../../modules/Modal';    // Regular JS module\n\nconst TestPage = ({ setShowSignup }) =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;Modal&gt;\n      &lt;Signup\n        signupSource='my_test_page'\n      /&gt;\n    &lt;/Modal&gt;\n  );\n};\n\nexport default TestPage;```\nThis is actually working fine, the modal is triggered and the signup island is rendered inside, it's quite cool. However I get SSR issues when attempting to render &lt;Signup/&gt; inside the modal.\nThe most far I managed to get without breaking SSR is the following inside `index.jsx` of Signup:\n\n```return (\n    &lt;Layout&gt;\n      &lt;script\n        type='text/javascript'\n        src='//js.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js'\n      &gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;\n      {/* &lt;Island\n        module={App}\n        hydrateOn='load'\n        fieldValues={fieldValues}\n        signupSource={signupSource}\n      /&gt; */}\n    &lt;/Layout&gt;\n  );```\nWhen I attempt to render the island it breaks.\nAny idea on how I should this properly?",
