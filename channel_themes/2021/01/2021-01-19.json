    "text": "I think there is a bug in the theme settings. I have created to option to set a default border radius for all buttons (`theme.buttons.defaults.borders.border_radius`), I then have a radius option for every corner (`theme.buttons.defaults.borders.border_top_right_radius` etc.), these fields inherit the value of `theme.buttons.defaults.border.border_radius` until it is overwritten. This all works great.\n\nI have then added a group of settings for each button (primary, secondary, etc.). These also have the same radius settings for each corner (`theme.buttons.primary.borders.border_top_right_radius`). This field inherits the value of `theme.buttons.defaults.borders.border_top_right_radius` .\n\nWhen I set the value of `theme.buttons.defaults.borders.border_top_right_radius` everything works great and `theme.buttons.primary.borders.border_top_right_radius` gets the same value. However, when I set the value of `theme.buttons.defaults.borders.border_radius` only `theme.buttons.defaults.borders.border_top_right_radius` inherits the value and `theme.buttons.primary.borders.border_top_right_radius` keeps an empty value. (Yes, I have clicked on reset before trying).\n\nWhat I expected was that when `field B` inherits from `field A` and `fields C` inherits from `field B` the value of `field C` would be set as well when I change the value of `field A`.\nBut `field C` only gets the value of `field B` if I update `field B` manually.\n\nOr am I missing something?",
