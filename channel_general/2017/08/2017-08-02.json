I was trying to do this for awhile and was able to get it all figured out using JS, the only issue is I wasnt able to get the twitter data 1 attribute in the meta tag as I wasnt able to do all the calculations (including counting of images) through HubL and instead had to do it through JS. How did HS go about getting this populated without JS?"
