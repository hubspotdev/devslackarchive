    "text": "Hi Everyone, I'm building a custom card, and I have a test version working, but I initially created it to display in \"contacts &gt; contacts\", the use case shifted, and now it needs to be displayed in 'sales &gt; deals'. I've search and found references to changing location from tab to the sidebar, but not to the deals section. I attempted to just change the objectTypes field from 'contacts' to 'deals'. but when I do I get an error stating the json doesn't match the associated scheme, and to add the fetch and subsequent attributes.",
