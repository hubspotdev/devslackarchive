    "text": "I suppose this may have been answered here already, but I can't really think of how to search for it.\n\nIs there a way to create default / placeholder content for a Programmable email module that depends on a contact property value to run a crm_objects() function to populate the content? Whenever I place these into my emails, it renders as just a blank box. Which makes sense, since there's no content to display yet. But it makes it hard to see if the module has been placed correctly / at all, and hard to move it around.\n\nDoes anyone know of a solution to this?",
