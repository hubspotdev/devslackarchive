For instance, we were hoping a \"Title\" or \"Role\" field would be added so you can show the authors title inside of the company like \"UX Designer\" or \"Finance Specialist\".  Currently the only way we are accomplishing it is by having to add `span` tags into the bio area so we can hide / show the items through css."
