    "text": "Hi all, just wondering if there's something I'm missing with the |float filter. When I attempt to convert a string, \"1.414\" in this case, into a float with the intention of doing math on it (for some font size calculations) it converts to \"1414.0\" in the EDITOR page (so in a rich text module in the editor for example) but on the published page I can clearly see it says \"font-size: 1.414(rem in this case)\". I need to be able to square the value so that's why I'm trying to convert it to a float"
