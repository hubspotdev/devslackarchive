    "text": "wondering if anyone else has run into this issue (or if itâ€™s a concern).\nUsing the PATCH request for route `cms/v3/blogs/posts/{post_id}` and the request body like so:\n```{\n  widgets: {\n    module_159300618883457: {\n      body: {\n        post_type: 'How-to/Guides',\n        product_category: 'Bar Tools'\n      },\n      child_css: {},\n      css: {},\n      id: 'module_159300618883457',\n      label: 'GA Content Grouping',\n      module_id: 31224486274,\n      name: 'module_159300618883457',\n      order: 0,\n      styles: {},\n      type: 'module'\n    }\n  }\n}```\nThis appears to work as intended. However, I noticed in the response body for the given post, the other `widgets` contents had a key:value of `deleted_at: &lt;timestamp&gt;`\nLooking at the edit screen and the live blog post however, no content appears to be missing, my paranoia of potentially deleting some unintended data makes me want to continue testing my script (since i have to update ~500 blog posts using this method).\nAny tips / other devs that have had to bulk update targeted custom modules with the API?"
