    "text": "Hello team,\n\nI need some help with an issue I’m facing. I have a code that I want to upload to HubSpot using a specific template. However, when I try to do it, the template doesn’t appear for some reason. I’m looking for someone who can provide some guidance or explain how I can ensure my template is visible and my code is correctly placed in the body.\n\nI’ll share a video explaining the issue in detail in case it helps clarify things. Any advice or assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!"
