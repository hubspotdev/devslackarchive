Super cool, excited to see what you've put together.\n\nSecondly, we have a small (1-person) team that manually checks and bug tests all submissions. So it takes awhile. They are shooting for 24 hour turn around time, however, with a flood of new submissions + INBOUND Conference + he's on his wedding and has someone new covering ... it may take a little bit.\n\nThanks for your patience, it will smooth out over time and get much faster.\n\nIf you don't hear back in a week, please DM me and I'll dig into it a bit more."
