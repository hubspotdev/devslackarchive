I'm passing in some query_dict values to set the limit but that doesn't seem to work. I keep getting back the same data set as the initial page load. Anyone have any experience with this? Is this something I'm not able to do? I even tried hsDebug=true and bust cache from the chrome plugin. Still getting the same behavior."
