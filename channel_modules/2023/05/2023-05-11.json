    "text": "Hello, a few months ago I asked here about custom posttype, like in wordpress. some people recommended Hubdb and other blog types. But Is it possible to fill the Hubdb with a editor of some sort? I want to have a projects type. But filling each project from the hubdb is really ugly and doesn't work well because it has alot of fields. Is there any way to do this? to fill the hubdb just like a blog?\n\nOur is the best way to use blog listings? But then I got to the problem of how I could only show specific listings?",
