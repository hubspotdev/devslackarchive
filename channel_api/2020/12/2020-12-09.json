I would ask for clarity."

It works in the scene that I use the OAuth link generated in my app, it asks me to give permission for the scope which I do and it redirects me to my app which is great.  My issue is that neither the webhooks configured fire, nor if I go into the account selected do I see a connected app, the screen is blank of any.  What am I missing please?  It should be really straight forward.  Does your partner account need to be active before this works?",
