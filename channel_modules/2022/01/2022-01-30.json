So the option is to ignore the gradient field altogether and just make 2 (or more) color fields and put them in a Gradient group, if you want value inheritance."

The two fields with red arrows were existing and their content renders fine, though the new `text_field` I’ve added (green arrow) doesn’t render its data. Everything is published. I’m new to HS so could be missing something, any thoughts would be appreciated :thumbsup:",
