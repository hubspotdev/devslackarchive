    "text": "Hi. I manage a portfolio of clients that we do a variety of work for. Unfortunately, HubSpot still has not created a master hub where I can see the Reports and performance of all clients in one place. They should figure this out if they want Agencies to better succeed. But, I want to specifically export a report from each clientâ€™s HS for email performance. I want to see in one place how all the various kpis for emails perform are doing bi-monthly for that client but also be able to see a higher level of how the emails are performing as a whole across all clients. I do have a funnel flow where they all have essentially a workflow of the same emails.  My problem is we cannot create a report that exports automatically from each client to me twice a month. Has anyone solved this by chance?"
