    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have a project where the client wants to be able to select specific blog posts, unfortunately the only field available seems to be selecting a specific blog. So the workaround I have to do is having a text field setup in which the user copies the in the blog post id, and then using the `content_by_id` function to pull in the relevant post content. Obviously having to deal with a long ID number isn't very user friendly at all.\n\nSo a field option to be able to search and select for the desired blog post that returns the ID in a user friendly way.\nAn equivalent example would be something like the \"post object\" field in Advanced Custom Fields for WordPress, which returns the post ID or post object with which you can run a query for.\n\nIf there is an easier way to do this I'm all ears, as I haven't been developing with HubSpot for very long, but I couldn't find a field that could do this.",
