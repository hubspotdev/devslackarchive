    "text": "<@U7SL518D6>, this is such a timely discussion. I was just using <https://blog.HubSpot.com/marketing/compress-image?hubs_signup-url=developers.HubSpot.com%2Fdocs%2Fcms%2Fguides%2Fspeed&amp;hubs_signup-cta=null&amp;_ga=2.165767486.1281838447.1598751878-1931719639.1595967195|this post> and Tinypng to compress my client's image files, but when I save the files from a new browser window they were in webp format. So I'd need to download, concert to png, before compressing. I noted that the file I was downloading (the webp file) was smaller than the finalized, compressed png, and was confused. This is such a helpful post for that reason.\n\nSo my big question to you is: let's say the original files are over 1 MB (my measuring stick for whether a file needs compression), with HS's automatic optimization of images, is the compression still helpful/necessary for SEO? Maybe minimally? Thanks for your thoughts."
