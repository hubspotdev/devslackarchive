    "text": "Hi, I'm currently trying to get my developer certificate. I have been having issues with the footer styling. In the assignment it specifically says that you have to use the same module for header and footer menu. When I'm making the footer, two levels deep, as expected of the assignment, it is styled super weird. To be honest I have no clue how to style it proberly, as I find it difficult to do, by just using CSS as HubSpot wraps everything in so many different divs and spans.",
