This allows users to view UI extensions without opening record pages, to get the right information from the right place.\n\n:arrow_forward:  <https://www.loom.com/share/183b1f37a018433fa7e9b82d9cd4a56d|Watch this Loom to know how it works>\n\nThere are three pages where this sidebar shows up\n• Object index pages (Deals, Tickets, Companies, Contacts, and custom objects)\n• All object record pages\n• Contact Lists\n:information_source: To stay posted on some of the larger features, use Product Updates page on your account, and look out for \"In Development\" updates.\nWe continue to look for more locations where developers can plug-in their extensions. If you have use cases, drop them in comments.",
