    "text": "We are actively working on improving the developer workflow, and this issue is something we’re working to resolve.\n\nRegarding serverless functions, that’s not actually true. Developer sandbox accounts do in-fact support serverless. The confusion lies in that we have a few different developer accounts at the moment. For App developers they have an app developer account, which can then create “Test accounts” those test accounts do not have CMS Hub.\n\nThen there is the developer sandbox account for CMS developers. That account DOES have serverless functions. Used in tandem with the enviornment variables you definitely can stage the serverless function and even have it operate  differently than your production build."
