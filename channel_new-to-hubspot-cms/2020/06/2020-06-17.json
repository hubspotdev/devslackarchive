    "text": "Hi!! I just started using HubSpot's Design Manager and I am implementing some pages for a website. I would like to make some custom modules from scratch and then a custom template from them. I want to be able to use some third party libraries like vue.js to make the the user interface really dynamic and cool (new to Vue.js too lol). However, I do not want to embed the CDN in each module. Is there a way for me to just import the Vue.js source code (or other third party libraries) for the entire template once and then use it in all the different modules I create for it?"

We're transitioning from Marketo, so I'm in the middle of figuring out whether to port in our old Marketo templates, redevelop from scratch, or retool existing HubSpot templates (for email and landing pages).\n\nI've also been asked to evaluate whether HubSpot CMS might work in place of our existing (pretty highly customized) WordPress website and blog setup"
