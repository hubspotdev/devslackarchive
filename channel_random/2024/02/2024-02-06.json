    "text": "Is anyone else pulling their hair out about HubSpot emails in Outlook? Looks like they changed some default code underlying all email templates and didn’t tell anyone. It’s not breaking emails in Outlook and NOT rendering in Litmus checks BEFORE we send them.\n\nI notice 3 things have changed that may haver something to do with it but I’m fairly certain it’s the last one:\n\n• There is an added ‘height=“auto”’ attribute added to all images. \n• All of their drag-and-drop sections have a div element with a class “hse-column-container” that no longer have an inline “width: 100%;” attribute.\n• Most importantly there is a major change to an if statement immediately after this element that is specifically related to Outlook:\n97,100c90,91\n&lt;  &lt;!--[if (mso)|(IE)]&gt;\n&lt; &lt;td valign=“top” style=“width:600px;“&gt;\n&lt; &lt;![endif]--&gt;\n&lt; &lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;\n---\n&gt;  &lt;!--[if true]&gt;\n&gt; &lt;td valign=“top” style=“width:600px;“&gt;"

    "text": "This last point seems to be what’s breaking the templates. But I think this is automatically generated by HubSpot and a bug on their end. I tried also sending emails from a separate HubSpot account with a generic template and I get the same result so it’s not our HubSpot account or Outlook, it’s a HubSpot change they made being incompatible with Classic Outlook in an attempted update behind the scenes."
