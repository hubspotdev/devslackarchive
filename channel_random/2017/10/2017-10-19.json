Does anyone have a good recommendation for one? \n\nOur key needs are HubSpot list integration, and more importantly a way to trigger events after the form is submitted. \n\nI think we tried to switch over to Stripe in the past but realized it wouldn't work due to no access to the HubSpot backend. If this is possible now that would be awesome!"
