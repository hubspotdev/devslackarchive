    "text": "hey <@U07M515KXM4>, I fully understand that pushing constantly updates to a live/prod environment is not a good use-case. From my experience the theme preview has still a few bugs since it's quite a new feature.\nTherefore I'd recommend to create a free test account at <http://developers.HubSpot.com|developers.HubSpot.com>. I'd also recommend to create an app-testing account instead of an CMS Sandbox. Inside the app-testing account you create your dev-account.\nThe difference between a CMS Sandbox and a test account from within an app-testing account is:\n• The CMS Sandbox has only CMS/Content Hub Enterprise like features \n• The test account from the app-test account has almost every Enterprise feature (with a few limitations but none that are crucial for development)\nOnce you've created the test account, push your development to this account, test/debug your code and once you're good - push it to live.\nYou can also create a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/cms/setup/github-integration|GitHub integration> if you like"
