    "text": "Hi guys :slightly_smiling_face:\nIs there anyway to combine two HubDB tables on a page? I know there's the column join (stated above), but not sure it will work in my scenario\nI've got a HubDB table based on Events, these have a Start Date and an End Date, eg. 2 Aug to 5 Aug\nThe other table is Webinars, which are one days events. The client doesn't want to see 2 Aug to 2 Aug on the frontend, so I've had to split the events into these two tables since leaving the date field blank automatically changes it to today's date.\nAny ideas how to tackle this?"
