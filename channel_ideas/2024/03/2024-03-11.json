    "text": "Thanks Magnus, i'll take a look and see if this might work for what i've got in mind. For reference I am currently enrolling contacts into a workflow using the current endpoint via a button on a custom CRM card (`/automation/v2/workflows/:workflowId/enrollments/contacts/:email` ) but this only supports contacts and it doesn't look like any further development is happening with it.\nI would like a button in the CRM Card (showing on deals) to enrol that deal into a workflow. I'm not ultra-familiar with webhooks within HubSpot, but are you suggesting it's possible to do this?\nIs there any guidance you might be able to send me on this to get started?"
