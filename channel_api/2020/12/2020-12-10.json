I read blogs and found that HS tracks users based on cookie value and that cookie installed by tracking code. I can get that cookie from client's browser but how can I set that cookie into contact through API so I can able to track his activity seamlessly.  Any idea ?",

I've been doing this using a third-party framework on my website (it tracks sesssion, duration, interactions and many other stuff) but I'd like to know if I can do this whilst using HubSpot only. I've read some info on HubSpot's marketing and events API, which can get me some data with the Web Analytics route, but it's still in beta phase and there aren't many variables in this route as there are in the framework I've been using already.\nKind regards :heart:",
