    "text": "Hopefully can advice me well about React and HubSpot. The main issue I have with HS is that the Dev Experience is quite low, so I would really like to try out to do everything within React using the boilerplate. What is the site we need to build and what are the goals:\n\nIts a corporate website. No need to login or something but it has a blog section and a careers page with filtering etc etc.\nBlogs/pages should be customisable. So they should be able to input strings, change headers, change textarea’s, change the image of a specific module.\nModules should be drag n drop. We will not use that advanced grid area but it’s more like they should be able to set the order of each module on the page.\n\n\nShould I just stick with HS and develop everything locally with the HS CLI and hubl language or could I try out React for this? Keep in mind that the customer should be able to edit pages and content.",
