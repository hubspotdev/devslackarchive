Use that branch or your own.\n\nWork on what you want to work on, we’re not verbatim copying everything from bootstrap but we thought their grid was a good thing to use for familiarity, and the fact bootstrap is well battle-tested.\n\nMy thought process on it was I was taking the scss files from bootstrap 4 for the grid and trying re-create them basically in HubL to make it flexible like bootstrap is.\n\nExample, if there are a bunch of numbered classes, there’s no reason we can’t just use a `{% for column in columns %}` type thing to generate the classes and CSS."
