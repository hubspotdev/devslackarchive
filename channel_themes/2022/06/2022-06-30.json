    "text": "Hello! I installed a theme that I got from themeforest (called Bomby). It looks fine in the editor, but when I publish and view the page on the URL, a bunch of CSS seems to be missing for the layout and styles. For example the header looks broken. It seems like it's an easy fix, since it looks fine in the editor. I'm pretty handy with coding so I can probably make the fix, if I could understand the differences between preview and live url in HubSpot....  Can someone point me in a direction? Thanks!",
