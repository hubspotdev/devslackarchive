This means that all of HubSpotters will be (or should be) taking some time to recharge our batteries. For that week specifically I would expect slower than normal - if at all - responses from HubSpot team members in this channel.\n\nWe :HubSpotheart: the activity in this channel, and will certainly be fully back online July 8.\n\nThank you for your patience that week and for continuing to build on HubSpot!",
