You can get that from the same function for custom objects, and for the built-in types, it's simply \"0-1\", \"0-2\" etc.\n\nIf you want to dynamically get all custom object types that are available for a certain account, use /crm/v3/schemas and look through them there. You should also see all the available association types in that response. It's a long one, though..."
