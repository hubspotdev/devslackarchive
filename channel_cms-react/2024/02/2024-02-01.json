We'd like to change that by migrating all modules to React and are looking for reassurance that we won't break already published pages.\n\nI ran some tests on my personal sandbox where I published a page based on a template with an \"old\" HubL module, then modified the template to use a React module with the same exact fields as the old one, updated those changes, and the already published pages seem to be able to pick up the change and still pass the same field values to the new module as they did to the old one.\n\nCan someone confirm that this is, in fact, expected behavior and not just a fluke?
