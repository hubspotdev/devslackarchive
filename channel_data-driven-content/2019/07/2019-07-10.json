    "text": "Can anyone explain this HubDB technical limitation to me... \"10 table scans per CMS page defined as a single call to hubdb_table_rows()\"? I have two custom modules on a page that each pull data from a different HubDB table (an events module and a training module). If I have the first \"upcoming training\" module on the page, the 2nd \"upcoming events\" module will not populate with data (should be showing 2 events). I was told this was due to the limit of 10 calls to hubdb_table_rows() per page. So basically because my first training module has 22 rows showing, a 2nd module on the page will be blank because I have hit a technical limitation? Am I just out of luck?? This is the page... <https://www.alignex.com/edina-mn-office>",
