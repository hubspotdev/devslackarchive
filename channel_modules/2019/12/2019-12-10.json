    "text": "Hi all, I don’t suppose anyone would happen to know if we can make module fields display conditionally to multiple other fields?\nat the moment we can only choose one field and say ‘is equal to’ / ‘not empty’ etc. but i find often at times for more complex modules, multiple conditions are necessary to keep the author experience clean and tidy.\n\nI found this post from over a year back asking for similar\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Custom-Module-Conditional-Fields-With-Multiple-Conditions/idi-p/203626>\n\nif anyone knows how to do this or something similar, please let me know ^^\n\nThanks",
