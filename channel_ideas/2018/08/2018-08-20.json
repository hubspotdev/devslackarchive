This will help people who are trying to integrate an actual version control system into their work flow identify where changes occured, it will also help developers not using those systems distinguish where certain changes occured.\n\nRight now since the revisions system doesn’t Diff the files you can’t tell what changed without manually diffing. Having the comments will atleast help with that.\n\nAll credit for this idea goes to <@U26BLKGE4> <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C22PU4LV8/p1534804032000100?thread_ts=1534800965.000100&amp;cid=C22PU4LV8>"
