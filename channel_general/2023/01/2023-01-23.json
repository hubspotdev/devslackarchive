I have a developer account with super-admin, but I don't see a way to make a private app to have the api-key interact with the API so I can define scopes. It's not working with them being undefined so I either have to create a private app or define scopes account wide. I'm following this: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/migrate-an-api-key-integration-to-a-private-app> but I don't see integrations at all :confused:",

Now, I searched around and found in the HubSpot Community forums that this feature is not there yet.\n\nHas anyone found a work-around/solution to this and keen to share? Would love to get some takes on this.\n\nCheers!"
