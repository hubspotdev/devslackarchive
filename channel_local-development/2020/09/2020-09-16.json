Within here if you find the cta script being blocked. In here there should be a single digit number within about the 5th Column. If you can click this this should bring up a details page which shows the filter that is blocking this script. If you can pass on screenshots of this this would be greatly helpful. There are also 2 other tabs on this page. If you can pass on screenshots of this it also should help us narrow down what specific list and setup is blocking this."
