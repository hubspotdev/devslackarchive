Tested it and indeed the hs_object_source is both read only as well as not relevant for it showing up the helpdesk workspace.\n\nI tried creating a ticket with just the required properties:\n```{\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"content\": \"Help everything is on fire\",\n        \"hs_pipeline\": \"0\",\n        \"hs_pipeline_stage\": \"1\",\n        \"subject\": \"test ticket API March 15\"\n    },\n    \"archived\": false\n}```\nAnd this works and shows up in the helpdesk.\n\nSo my revised steps to troubleshoot would be:\n1: make the exact API call through Postman as above and verify it works\n2: get the example ticket you have issues with, and duplicate it for testing.\n3: patch fields to match the ticket as created in step 1 one at a time and see which one does the trick.\n4: if that does not work: delete /patch other fields that are different one at a time till it matches the ticket as created in step 1."

We just do not set any quantity for those line items we just want in the deal as alternate bid items for example.

The deal amount will not include those because the normal fields (quantity and price) and left at zero or blank.   So we could have say 10 line items in the deal but 5 of them are just set as alternate bid items that will not be automatically calculated in the deal amount."

    "text": "Hello. This may be a bit of a basic question, but I'm struggling to figure out the context I need. I'm working with a web application that's using a lot of legacy API code to talk to HubSpot. Currently a big part of our integration relies on the legacy event API (<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/enterprise_events/http_api|link>). The changes I'm making will require us to start tracking events not only on Contacts but Companies as well, which the legacy API does not support. Obviously the move is to migrate to the new custom events API, but I'm finding some discrepancies in how it is handled vs the old one and I want to confirm a few things.\n\n1. Are event properties able to be mapped to the HubSpot object properties? E.g. in the legacy API, we can send object properties in the payload of the API call and these properties will be set on the HubSpot Contact. The new API's properties don't seem to work this way - the properties are custom on the event, they don't correspond to the custom properties you configure for your objects... as far as I can tell? Can they be mapped somehow?\n2. Is there some way to ... customize the primary record ID for the Contact/Account in the new API? I'm looking at our old Event code and we pass a payload that has a simple \"ID\" field which corresponds to our internal ID for the contact, _not_ HubSpot's. Somehow, HubSpot knows to look for this ID and use it as a primary identifier. This is _not_ the Record ID stored in the contact in HubSpot. I have no idea how it's working or if similar functionality exists in the new API.\nThanks for your time! Sorry the info is vague, I'm working with only a small part of the context here with a system I inherited, so you'll have to bear with me a bit. I'm happy to provide more details as requested."
