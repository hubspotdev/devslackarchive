FTP works pretty great now, you have full access to the design manager file system minus drag n drop templates.\n\nPeople have started setting up build processes that can work with it or via the api.\n\nThey also updated the local HubL server. (I don’t fully know the scope of changes there. didn’t use the original one much)"

However, it’s pulling results for the landing pages on that URL. They both have site results system pages set up… I was trying to figure out if you can filter the results by a specific blog (using the blog ID). Any suggestions?\n:thinking_face:",
