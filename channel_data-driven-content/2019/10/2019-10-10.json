Each folder gets its content from a separte hubdb table. And all files are retrived on pageload, and then hidden with css based on file/folderpath.\n\nIf I cant bypass the 10 table limit,  I have 3 time consuming options.\n1: Structure the data in a different way (The way it is now is relativly simple to maintain)\n2: Refresh the page on every change in directory so only 1 table is being called. (Might be a little annoying?)\n3: Number 2, but with a ajax call to the HubDB API and then update the folder content without a page refresh\n\n\nScreenshots of hubdb and the filedirectory root folder",
