I am new to our instance of HubSpot and I'm trying to get an understanding of how our Contact Properties relate to Workflows. Specifically, which properties are used most often for enrolling contacts in workflows.\n\nI imagine there's some combination of contact properties\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/v2/get_contacts_properties>\n\nand something in the workflows API, potentially"
