Not sure which channel is the most appropriate one to post this: We want to create an integration between our platform and the HS instances of clients that authorize our HS app. We created an app with multiple permissions (like editing deals, organizations, read access, etc), several ones. This generates a link that can be used to \"install\" the app as I understand. When I load that link (that looks like this):\n\n```<https://app.HubSpot.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=[the_client_id]&redirect_uri=https://url.com/HubSpot/callback&scope=crm.schemas.companies.write%20crm.schemas.contacts.write%20crm.objects.line_items.read%20crm.schemas.deals.read%20crm.objects.line_items.write%20crm.schemas.deals.write%20crm.schemas.orders.write%20crm.import%20collector.graphql_schema.read%20crm.schemas.orders.read%20collector.graphql_query.execute%20crm.objects.orders.write%20oauth%20crm.objects.orders.read%20conversations.read%20crm.objects.listings.read%20crm.objects.leads.read%20crm.objects.listings.write%20crm.objects.leads.write>...```\nand I try to authorize the app, I get this message:\n\n```Authorization failed because this account doesn't have access to the scopes required by the app. Please contact HubSpot support.```\nI understand there's some mismatch between the permissions in the link and the actual permissions of the app, but as I understand that link gets updated depending of which permissions I add (I am copying the link from the section in the attached image), so what I could be doing wrong? Is there a way to get more details about this error to be able to solve it?",
