It just responds to an existing conversation. I would like to know why this limitation exists, if it really exists, and if there is any other endpoint for this purpose that could help me?",

I have a similar script that pulls from the Deals Table. What I'm struggling with is how to associate the Deals to the Contacts. I have an association type set up but as I need the data outside of HubSpot and I'm using SQL to create a new data report, I need to know how to link the 2 data tables. I've looked over the Associations API but Im not trying to push data into HubSpot and cant find anything that helps. Appreciate any support or guidance. Thanks, Dan",
