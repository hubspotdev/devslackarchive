It works fine in the preview but the proper fields are not updated/exposed in the designer when the module is added to a page. The image above is the simplest way I could demonstrate the error I am talking about. The image and text fields would be dependent on the selection of a radio choice field with an option for each and the field group would be repeatable.",
