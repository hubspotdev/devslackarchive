    "text": "Good morning.  We're implementing the HS support module.  Either I'm missing something or I've found a technical challenge in workflows.   I can't seem to get a trigger based off a simple email domain working? Meaning, if something comes in from another support system (partner ticket system) shouldn't we be able to start routing from there?   <mailto:support@support.domain.com|support@support.domain.com> = trigger?\n\nThus far we're using exchange routing rules to send to a HS processing inbox, and custom code routing from there. Seems kludgy. Is there a better method?"

I'm building a workflow that fires when a custom object is created on a company record.\n\nIn the custom object, I have added a company association but it looks like the associated company does not get passed into the event when an object is created. Is this possible? If not is there a way to automatically get the company that the custom object was created on?",
