I already cloned the default subscription template and assigned it in our settings, so now I'm just trying to get the code right. One thing I can't seem to figure out is how to reference contact data so we can post things like names, properties, etc, of whoever is visiting that page. I tried to reference this page of HubL variables - <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/cms/hubl/variables#required-email-template-variables> - but for things like \"account\" or \"contact\" I'm either getting no output at all or \"null\".",

After some chat's with HS I got the info that the preference/subscription page(s) do not have any personalization possibilities and the only thing that is getting pulled from the CRM is the email-adress. Anything else is not possible.\n\nI've seen(and worked) with solutions made by other devs/agencies/partners that had a personalized subscription page - BUT, this is def. something you don't want to start doing since it's similar to \"Guarantee voided if sticker is removed\", this is why I don't want to describe how it was accomplished. :slightly_smiling_face:"

Technically a theme provider is able to put some sort of JS in, that will override this default behaviour."
