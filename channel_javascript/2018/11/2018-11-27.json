We are working on a web page which is listing out values from the HubDB - see screen shot attached.\n\nAt the moment the results are static but we would like to integrate Ajax filtering so that by changing the slider values at the top of the page the data is dynamically filtered.\n\nDo you know whether this is possible within HubSpot and if so are there any examples out there which I can take a look at?\n\nMany thanks,\nChris",
