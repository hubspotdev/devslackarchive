Microsoft Word supports VML(Vector Markup Language), The word rendering engine however does not support a lot of CSS properly. \n\nSo clever dev’s have for years been faking css features using VML which will only render in outlook.\n\nSo often when you look at tutorials for HTML emails you’ll see things like bulletproof buttons(which use VML) background images(use VML) etc."
