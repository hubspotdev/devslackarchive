In CSS files it’s rendered at publish, so it’s not aware of the screen size of the web client nor would it be able to change if the user say rotates their device or makes the browser window bigger/smaller.\n\nYou should use CSS for that. You can provide multiple variables say one for mobile, one for desktop.\n\nSome folks will take that abstraction even further and instead use CSS custom properties, Then you can even use JavaScript to change the custom property value and cause different things to happen."
