    "text": "I've run into a situation that I'm having a difficult time to address and isn't necessarily related to ui-extensions but rather a library my ui-extension uses.  This is a project I have inherited to make enhancements to.\n\nEssentially, the project uses a library called \"sharp\" and when I run the extension locally - everything works.  Once deployed to our sandbox account, there is the following console error.\n\n```{\n    \"status\": \"ERROR\",\n    \"message\": \"[runServerlessFunction] The serverless function 'createProposalAndUpload' failed to execute: Could not load the \\\"sharp\\\" module using the linux-x64 runtime\\nPossible solutions:\\n- Ensure optional dependencies can be installed:\\n    npm install --include=optional sharp\\n- Ensure your package manager supports multi-platform installation:\\n    See <https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install#cross-platform>\\n- Add platform-specific dependencies:\\n    npm install --os=linux --cpu=x64 sharp\\n- Consult the installation documentation:\\n    See <https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install>.\"\n}```\nNow, there is this open bug (<https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828>) reported related to cross-platform optional dependencies where during the build process, the optional dependencies don't get installed.  It's all documented in that github issue.\n\nI've removed node_modules, package-lock.json, clear git cache and pushed the project back to github for rebuilding and yet everytime I the ui-extension encounters the same error above.\n\nI've even copied the contents of the package-lock.json from the production version and pushed that to Github and still no success.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? Maybe there is another cache layer or should I disconnect / reconnect the project.",
