    "text": "Hi all. I’m trying to call the tracking api’s identify method multiple times, so as to progressively add custom properties to the contact as they are known.\n\nThe first time I will send an email and a first name\n\n```_hsq.push(['identify', {\n    email: '<mailto:abc@gmail.com|abc@gmail.com>',\n    firstname: 'Norman',\n}])\n\n_hsq.push(['trackPageView'])```\nThis code is updating or creating the contact associated with <mailto:abc@gmail.com|abc@gmail.com>\n\nThen, on a second call I’ll send the lastname and phone.\n\n```_hsq.push(['identify', {\n    email: '<mailto:abc@gmail.com|abc@gmail.com>',\n    firstname: 'Norman',\n    lastname: 'Bates',\n    phone: '123456789'\n}])\n\n_hsq.push(['trackPageView'])```\nThis time, I’m not seen the new properties updated on the contact record.\n\nNote: Both calls are from the same web session. As you may guess when on a new session this second call will update the properties as I wanted.\n\nIs it impossible to call ‘identify’ more than once so as to progressively update contact’s properties?",
