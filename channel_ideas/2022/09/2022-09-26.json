    "text": "When creating a form and selecting Standalone page. Two ideas:\n\n1. The published URL isn’t branded (like meetings or using a connected domain). It was be awesome to be able to select a custom domain. <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Customise-URL-for-standalone-page-form/idi-p/474589|Current idea around custom urls (not domains)>.\n2. The page title just says “form”. I would love to be able to set header meta like title, meta description and header item like noindex. <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Favicons-and-page-titles-in-standalone-forms/idi-p/575742|Current idea around title and favicon>.\nI’d love some upvotes or feedback on this idea. <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Form-Standalone-Page-Meta/idi-p/698293|Here’s the new idea link>."
