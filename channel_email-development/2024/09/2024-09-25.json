    "text": "how does HubSpot deal with emails where the content has properties of a primary object and also needs to include associated records. Here's an example:\n\nSay I have a `Company` that represents a Real Estate Agent, and i have deals that represents the various current listings that the agent has on the market.  I want to include an email that has some properties of the `Company` (i.e. Agent) and all their Listings (i.e. deal records associated with that company) in a single email.\n\nHow would do go about doing this? I'm relatively new to email building so any pointers would be super helpful.",
