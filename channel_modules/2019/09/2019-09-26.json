    "text": "Greetings everyone. I have a question about updating custom modules.  I've created many for a client that are all working fine. They have asked for some small edits and tweaks.  To my shock, they say that when a module is updated (in any way it seems) that all the content in existing pages is LOST!!!  (the content reverts to default content) Now surely that has to be a bug or screw up by me, otherwise how can dev's maintain modules?  I said I would ask you knowledable people here. *My question is: if you update a custom module, by changing code or adding a new field, will it reset all content in existing pages that contain the module?*  :fearful: and if that shouldn't happen what do you think the reason could be?",

    "text": "I can think in two main reasons why it could been lost:\n- Slug of fields/groups changed. (like you wrapped your fields in a new group the slug will change and the content will be lost like `group_slug.field`\n- Remove the CM and add it back to the template or in the content editor. I believe the internal ID associated will change each time you do this and therefor the content is lost"
