I tested the following module (taken from the documentation):\n```{% module \"department\" path=\"@HubSpot/choice\", label=\"Choose department\", value=\"Marketing\", choices=\"Marketing, Sales, Dev, Services\" export_to_template_context=True %}```\nAnd when trying to generate a new quote theme, the choices are not correctly taken (see image). Has anyone found a similar issue? Is that a bug?",
