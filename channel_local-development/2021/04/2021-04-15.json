Error: self signed certificate in certificate```\nIt was working just fine before my os got updated. Anyone is having similar issue or know any workaround on how do I fix this?\n\nThis does not auto create _HubSpot.config.yml_ file and then also not pulling the boilerplate as well.\n\nMuch appreciated the help.",
