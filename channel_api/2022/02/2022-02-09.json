Host your own node, C#, python, whatever backend.. and have your front end call it to make the HubSpot requests instead of the client browser. You can also look a jsonp for some requests but the server side method is the way to go."

    "text": "Hello everyone! I am attempting to use the Contact Search API to get a list of recently updated contacts who are also a part of a list. I was easily able to get recently updated contacts using the last modified date, but there doesnt appear to be any buillt in way to filter by list. So instead, I opted to retrieve all contacts in a list separately and return their emails in an array which I then planned on using in my Search API call using the \"IN\" operator. When testing in Postman this works perfectly, but when attempting to run my code in my react app using the HubSpot/api-client, I am consistently getting the same error message:\n\n`Invalid input JSON on line 1, column 197: Cannot construct instance of `com.HubSpot.inbounddb.publicobject.core.v3.search.Filter`, problem: operator IN requires values`\n\nHowever, I am indeed providing the parameter \"values\" and the identical code works fine in Postman. Has anyone else run into this issue before? Am I missing something? Here are my filter groups for this request:\n\n```filterGroups: [\n  {\n    filters: [\n      {\n        value: \"1642185521000\",\n        propertyName: \"lastmodifieddate\",\n        operator: \"GTE\",\n      },\n      { propertyName: \"email\", operator: \"HAS_PROPERTY\" },\n      {\n        propertyName: \"email\",\n        operator: \"IN\",\n        values: members, // this is an array of emails\n      },\n    ],\n  }\n]```",

This API requires authentication and can't be hit from the front end (since you'd be leaking your credentials)"
