This \"utm_source\" is then sent to the Deal creation API call and stored in a custom property called \"contact_source.\" While this logic works for some contacts, it does not consistently capture the source for all contacts coming from Facebook or Google ads.\n\nApart from above logic, we have used the JavaScript tracking script throughout the pages of the website:\n\n&lt;!-- Start of HubSpot Embed Code --&gt;\n&lt;!-- &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" id=\"hs-script-loader\" async defer src=\"&lt;//js.hs-scripts.com/HUBID.js&gt;\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; --&gt;\n&lt;!-- End of HubSpot Embed Code --&gt;\n\nThis script serves to display the HubSpot chat option on the website and also facilitates the storage of contact source indicators (e.g., Paid social, Paid search) in the 'Original source drill-down 2' filter option. Should you require further details, please don't hesitate to ask, and we'll gladly provide additional information.\n\nYour attention to this matter is greatly appreciated, and we eagerly await your response.\n\nThank you again."

I am trying to find a way, however, to send the HubSpot user token (stored in a cookie) which contains the information about any ads the user may have navigated to the platform via. As far as I can tell, there is no way for me to do this and the only way to add the HubSpot user token is by identifying the contact via the javascript client. I am hoping that this is not the case and I am missing something obvious in the documentation so hopefully you can point me at that.\n\nIf it’s helpful, here is the code we’re using the python SDK to create the contact.\n\n```    def create_contact(self, user: FFAdminUser, HubSpot_company_id: str) -&gt; dict:\n        properties = {\n            \"email\": user.email,\n            \"firstname\": user.first_name,\n            \"lastname\": user.last_name,\n            \"hs_marketable_status\": user.marketing_consent_given,\n        }\n\n        response = self.client.crm.contacts.basic_api.create(\n            simple_public_object_input_for_create=SimplePublicObjectInputForCreate(\n                properties=properties,\n                associations=[\n                    {\n                        \"types\": [\n                            {\n                                \"associationCategory\": \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n                                \"associationTypeId\": 1,\n                            }\n                        ],\n                        \"to\": {\"id\": HubSpot_company_id},\n                    }\n                ],\n            )\n        )\n        return response.to_dict()```\nThanks!",
