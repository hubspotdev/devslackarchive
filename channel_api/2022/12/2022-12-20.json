There’s limited ability to customize it (like filtering for only records associated to the record you’re on). However, in UI, under Settings -&gt; Object, there’s a link that says “Customize association tables”. When I saw that, I thought I could use that, but that capability only exists via the UI to my knowledge.\n\nThis is a symptom of a larger problem I’m dealing with though - that there’s not parity between the UI and the API. We need to be able to do a myriad of operations programmatically that we can’t, including, but not limited to the one mentioned above, setting field-level permissions, being able to read workflows, etc.\n\nDoes that clear anything up? More than happy to jump on a call! :)"
