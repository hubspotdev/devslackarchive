How can I track the clicks of a link that's not directly in an email but in a personalization token in the email?",

    "text": "Yes you can use the repeater option. I <https://www.courtneyfantinato.com/custom-HubSpot-email-template/|wrote something up> using it as a way to provide flexible content blocks that you may find helpful.\n\nAs for the image, you could allow the end user to upload/choose an image with the image field, and then use the number field to choose a width to display the image at, providing the min and max. Or thereâ€™s other options like the select dropdown if you want to provide pre-defined sizes. It all depends on what you need. But I would only do image width, and set the height to auto."
