It seems to me it's not possible to hook into the 'native' calls/emails, but can perhaps be achieved by creating two new types of timeline events. Is that correct? It seems I cannot use timeline events that are not created by my app, is that correct?",

    "text": "<@ULSCN5SSW> Thanks for the reply! You're right, we'd probably need to increase the syncing frequency down the road. We see there's two ways of keeping data up to date, either with the legacy get_recently_updated endpoint or the POST search object endpoint (filter by lastmodifieddate), which way did you use? Another question we have is how would you sync the relationships efficiently. We see there's a separate endpoint in syncing the relationship but is there anyways to tell if the related object is updated through the primary object?"
