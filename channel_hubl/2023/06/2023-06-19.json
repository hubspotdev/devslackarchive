I was trying to use a `dnd_module` that accepted a repeater field group (as shown), and it would work with a static array `tab_item=[ item1, item2, item3 ]` but it was failing if it did `{% set items = [ item1, item2, item3 ] %}` and then `tab_item=items`.\n\nFortunately, this post gave me the idea to try `tab_item=\"{{ items }}\", which worked! :sweat_smile: This syntax and behavior does not seem to be documented in either <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/using-modules-in-templates> or any of the HubL syntax pages.",
