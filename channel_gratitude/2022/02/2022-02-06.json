    "text": "New here and been spending some cycles in the HubSpot LMS (aka HubSpot Academy). It is hands down the best user experience I've see to date. The team view (that shows you the certs and who has taken what) is invaluable. The UI is great, the instructors are fantastic - and it all results in a no hassle learning experience. BIG PROPS to the HS team behind it. Finally, I'm curious... is the LMS built on top of HubSpot CMS, a themed 3rd party solution (and which one), or other?",
