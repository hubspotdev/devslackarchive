    "text": "Hi all, was wondering if anyone had found workarounds to use the HubSpot API to book meetings on a shared calendar. I posted about it in the <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Using-API-to-schedule-meetings/td-p/586470|community forum>, but it sounds like the current functionality is limited to sending a meeting request without knowing availability. <@UD53A9UUR> You responded to the forum post, any idea if the availability endpoint is currently in the works? The meetings endpoint doesn't allow for much use on our end without knowing availability.",

    "text": "Hi everyone, we're currently using a meeting link on a landing page, that would first display a schedule where we can select day and hour of meeting, and then we fill a small form with the contact's  data... The problem is i don't see a way to grab the information passed on the form, using a $form.find('[name=\"firstname\"]') methodology for example (this works with regular HubSpot forms using Jquery for data management). So my main question is how can i access the data inside the form that follows a meetings schedule form in a landing page? Thanks in advance for all the hepl! is much appreciated!!"
