    "text": "ISO of assistance integrating our HubSpot Starter and Quickbooks Online Plus platforms.\n\nI have been researching between HS native apps and 3rd party integrations and getting mixed reviews.  MY HS starter account does not allow me tech support, only chat support.\n\nMy experience with chat support is they are not experienced with either the integration nor QBO.  Have also read hiring a 3rd party company to complete the integration can also turn into a nightmare.\n\nI'm really stuck and need to get this integration going to tighten up our backend and cut our sales process time in half.  Caveat being I'd like to do this right, the first time.\n\nOpen to any suggestions/ advice!",
