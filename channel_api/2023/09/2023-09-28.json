Now I've set the properties, but I'm not sure on how to set the associations: `DealSimplePublicObjectWithAssociations` accepts only `array&lt;string,string&gt;` wich is not compatible with the structure that I've used in postman (`array&lt;string,array&gt;`):\n```\"associations\": [{\n    \"to\": {\n      \"id\": \"101\"\n    },\n    \"types\": [\n      {\n        \"associationCategory\": \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n        \"associationTypeId\": 3\n      }\n     ]\n}] ```\nDo you have any example?\nThank you",

    "text": "Hi, Everyone, I'm new to the forum and happy to be here. I have an issue that I have been struggling with and was hoping to gain some insight from someone who might have experienced this before. Essentially I'm using the HubSpot API's to create/update a deal. I also have revenue attribution for landing pages showing revenue etc. I'm able to create and update a deal through its various stages via the API correctly, associate contacts and company etc, however upon updating/closing the deal via the API ( 50-Won status ), I'm not getting the attribution report to display the Amount from the deal. If I close the deal via the UI, then everything shows fine in the attribution reports, however not via the API. I have read all the documentation on attribution report basics, meet all the requirements etc and done all the necessary things but cannot get the attribution report for landing pages to properly display the revenue, once the deal is closed via the API, instead of the UI. Has anyone ever had this problem and can you kindly suggest anything that I might try. Thanks",
