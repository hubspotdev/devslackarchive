    "text": "Are the developer and CMS deliberately separated? Can I have a HubSpot Developer user inside a CMS account? I already tried unsuccessfully to create a developer account with the same email that I use to login to the CRM. Basically, I work for a company that is looking to sync HubSpot information to our administration portal. I can get the information with an API key but that requires me to initiate the request. WebHooks appear to be what I am looking for but it looks like I can only add apps from the \"Marketplace\"."
