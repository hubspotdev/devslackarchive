    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe are facing another issue with HubSpots private content.\n\nOn our website pages/landing pages, whenever we enable \"Access group membership required\" under \"Access Control\" and publish the page, an invitation email gets sent to all people in that access group membership list. Is there a way to disable that? Also an invitation gets sent out whenever a user gets added to that membership list from the dynamic Filter selected in the membership list. We don't want to send out those invitations, but it seems HubSpot is doing that automatically. Is there a way to disable it?\n\nWould be grateful for an answer, thanks alot.",
