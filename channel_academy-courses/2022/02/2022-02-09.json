    "text": "What Brooke said. Maybe we should reword that a bit to be clearer. The idea here is that you shouldn't _start_ from the boilerplate, but copy/pasting from the boilerplate is fine. It's unfortunately a little grey in terms of making requirements, but the intention is to make folks show that they understand what all the bits are doing. If you start with the boilerplate, you can thrash around and meet the requirements without totally understanding what you're doing. If you start from scratch and copy/paste, you're demonstrating that you understand what you're doing. Sorry if that's not totally clear in the instructions."
