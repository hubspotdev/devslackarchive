    "text": "Apologies if this isn’t the best place to ask this question.  I have a heap of webhooks sending json data to various plugins that I use.  Normally they send properties such as email and firstname, lastname, phone etc.  All of a sudden the json data isn’t including this data.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I noticed a change to the look of the workflows today, have there been any changes to the webhook functionality in conjunction with those changes?  Freaking out as I have a number of businesses dependant on these plugins and they workflows are getting 500 errors because not all the data is included now."
