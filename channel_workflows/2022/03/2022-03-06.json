    "text": "Hi there! I've a few questions about `workflows`\n1- For example, If you want to use `format data` in the workflow, using `change date format` in the field `created_date`and then send it to a google sheet, does it only send rows with non empty `created_date` field?\n2 - Using the API i just have 150 calls per 10 sec, so, when I used the workflow, just add 150 rows, but i need like 600, how can i do to get everything? (in this field i think there is a lot of answers, but i can't get any :c )\n\nthanks!!!"
