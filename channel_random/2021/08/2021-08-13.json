    "text": "HubSpot Advanced Forms, Switch Button and custom style\n----------------------------------------------------\nHi All,\n I am looking for a way to style HubSpot forms more accurately.\nSpecifically, I want to implement a form like Correctiv did in this example:\n<https://correctiv.org/newsletter/>\nThe switch buttons, but also the texts underneath are especially exciting.\nIn the example, the whole thing was implemented with MailChimp, as can be seen in the HTML code, with a little custom CSS.\nBUT how can I implement something like this in HubSpot?\nI have already tried it with HubSpot Custom Modules. But not all our customers use the HubSpot CMS.\nI am curious about your suggestions!"

The form is set to re-direct to the same page it is on, only to then show the “unlocked” version of the page using HubSpot’s smart content feature to control who can access the video on the page. I was wondering what exactly the function would be to add this delay to the form, if possible. Thanks!",
