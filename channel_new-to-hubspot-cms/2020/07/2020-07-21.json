I'm enjoying the local dev with HubSpot this being my second HS site build and first with the new CMS and local dev I've run through all the local dev setup and CMS documentation and working off the boilerplate template but I am out of ideas how to center an image in the dnd_module through code. Below is the image module and I can align the image center through the HubSpot site when editing the page but I can't seem to set the alignment through code so it's initially centered. I feel like it's something easy I just can't see. Thank you!\n```{% dnd_module path='@HubSpot/image',\n  img={\n   'alt': 'Illustrated eye icon',\n   'size_type': 'auto',\n   'align': 'center',\n   'src': get_asset_url('../images/branding-icon.png')\n  }\n%}\n{% end_dnd_module %}```",
