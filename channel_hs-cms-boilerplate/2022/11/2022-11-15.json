    "text": ":corgi-wave: We just released a new minor version the boilerplate (v.3.7.0: <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/releases/tag/v3.7.0>) The main update is here replacing the custom blog_listing and pagination modules with the updated default versions of these modules. These updates will not impact any themes built off of the boilerplate, but any new theme built off the boilerplate will utilize the updated modules.\n\nPlease let us know if there are things you'd like to see in boilerplate that aren't already reflected in the open issues in the time being (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-requests>)!"
