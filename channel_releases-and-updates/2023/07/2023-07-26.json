We can use that for categories. \n• The tab suggestion is a great idea from <@UATE4ATHP> for the main building blocks\n• To differentiate modules, we can give a quick sort/dropdown icon in the search bar itself having values Default HS Modules, Theme Modules, and Standalone modules which shows the items based on the selection on the pane."
