    "text": "I'm having trouble with asset paths in my child theme.\n\nI've created a child theme of maka_Agency POWER THEME. I've copied templates/layouts/base.html to my child theme in order to customize. However, in the child theme base.html, all of the paths give the warning \"...there is no resource at path...\" I can confirm that the parent theme has this file. And, I've even tried referencing it directly to the parent theme, which resulted in a different warning of \"using asset outside current theme\". What is the correct way to handle these inherited paths so that they work properly in a child theme? My 1st screenshot is of one of these paths in base.html in the child theme, and the 2nd screenshot is showing the asset does in fact exist in the parent theme. All of the paths being required or included as partials or modules are giving the same warnings in the child theme. What can I do to fix this?",
