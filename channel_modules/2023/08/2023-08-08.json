    "text": "Hi all,\nI created a landing page with a custom form in it (using the default HubSpot editor sections for both forms and landing pages).\nUnfortunately, the form width is not in line with the header above the landing page and I can't modify the margins of the form in the landing page edit section .\nI know that probably it should be really simple to do that but I don't understand how to do it. I already asked to the HubSpot support and they told me that this is a developer task. I'm not a developer and I don't have enough skills regarding this.\nCould someone kindly help me with this? Thank you so much anyways",
