    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI'm working on setting up an automated workflow in HubSpot and need some assistance. Here’s what I’m trying to achieve:\n1. *HubSpot App Creation*: I’ve created a HubSpot app and set up a webhook within it.\n2. *Workflow Trigger*: I’ve configured a workflow that triggers whenever a new deal is created.\n3. *Data Transfer*: The goal is to automatically capture data from the newly created deal and send it to our system using a HubSpot POST API.\nHowever, I’m running into an issue where the URL seems to be invalid, and I’m not receiving any response when testing the webhook in Postman.\nHas anyone set up something similar or can guide me on how to properly configure this workflow so that it automatically retrieves data when a deal is created on the website? Any insights or steps to troubleshoot this would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks in advance!",
