There are some tricks some developers use by using macros and imports, that kind of emulates this.\n\nAdditionally you could consider creating smaller modules like a button module, and using it within a reusable section. Then you can use those smaller pieces in a reusable way across many pages etc.\n\nThen for any situations that doesn’t solve for you can still create a larger module that just includes some of those smaller pieces."

For example, if you know that a button requires the same fields you can create a `button` group(s) of JSON and copy/paste across modules. Similarly, you can do the same for markup."
