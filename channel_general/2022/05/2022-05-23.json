I created a static html multiple choice quiz and plan to map the responses to newly-created single-line fields within HubSpot. Most of the responses are working as intended, however I'm seeing a few questions take the label as the response instead of one of the multiple choice options (screenshots and code snippets will be added). Any assistance resolving this issue is greatly appreciated!",
