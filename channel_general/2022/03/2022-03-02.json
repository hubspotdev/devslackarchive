    "text": "Hello,\n\nI was creating a resource centre using HubSpot's blog functionality.\nEach resource/article should redirect to a HubSpot landing page; to do this I created a custom module inside my resources to handle the metadata. ( the redirection url, the name of the button etc... )\n\n\nIt works well and I can retrieve this information quite easily using the widgets code: {{tag_<http://post.widgets.management/|post.widgets.management>.body.button_label}}\n\n\n\n\nHowever my url cannot be retrieved and is always equal to \"null\" if my url type is \"content\" rather than \"external\"\n\n\nHave you already experienced the problem?",
