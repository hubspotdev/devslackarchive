You're using one or more of these &lt;your_field_name&gt; options. Remove them from these places first, or merge them with other options.```\nBut with the API these guards will not be in place.\nAnd you could potentially end up with some records having invalid values on them (values that are not part of the current enumeration)\n\nAs long as you are only adding new enum options like you mentioned in the first message in the thread, this should not be a problem <@U049WTE7AEB>"

It only requires an API key connector on the Looker side, so it’s not a middleware integration or an installed marketplace app. Looker seems to be reaching the batch update endpoint for either contacts or companies, and the Looker logs are not showing any errors on the API response, but in HS it shows 0 calls made to the private app key. Has anyone here used this Looker connector to send data to HS using the scheduled send tool? Any help is greatly appreciated!",

I need to search through tasks by subject and pull the ids for the tasks that match a specific task subject name. I need to do it using the API, however the search endpoint for tasks (/crm/v3/objects/tasks/search) is a post request and I'm not sure why. Can you help me understand two things:\n1) What is being posted when you search for tasks via the task search endpoint?\n2) How can I get the api to return the ID's of the specific tasks I'm searching for?\n\nThanks so much!",
