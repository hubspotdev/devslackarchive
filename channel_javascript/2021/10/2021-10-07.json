Is there a way for me to control what metadata is added alongside the data I explicitly define with `identify` like this?\n\n```window._hsq.push(['identify', { the_props: 'I care about' }])```\nThe issue I’m facing is that we unintentionally breach our customers’ privacy. One example is if they write an internal update/news article, let’s say it’s something like _*We just made a $1 million dollar sale, the biggest in our history!*_ – this title is then set as the document title when navigating to that article, and if that happens to be the current page when the `identify` call gets fired, this title will appear as the tracking event’s entry title inside HubSpot.",
