    "text": "Hi! First time here. As apparently everyone else I’m working on an integration that will sync some data to HS from an external system. Initially I’m testing the Python API with some products, as they seem easy to get going. We have a few custom properties defined for our products, such as EAN, width, height as well as some identifiers that link to the external system.  I use the `crm.products.basic_api.create()` to create a new product and the returned response contains the new product along with the values for the custom properties I set. However, the next time I query the products using `crm.products.get_all()` I see the new products there (verified with the HS id), but none of our custom properties are included. I guess this is something I’m misunderstanding here in how custom properties are supposed to work?",
