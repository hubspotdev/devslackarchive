    "text": "hi team! I am trying to extract a contact property using Python in a custom code but am having trouble doing so. The main goal is to find the earliest date that any contact at a company reached the SQL stage- specifically for companies that have multiple contacts associated. However, I'm not able to actually pull the specific property (custom_date_became_sales_qualified_lead) that I want for each of the identified contacts. My code is in the thread and the error I'm getting is `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'custom_date_became_sales_qualified_lead'`. If anyone has any experience or insight on this, it would be greatly appreciated!\n\nHere's the gist of what I'm trying to do:\n1. Identify the Company Name of the Contact that's currently enrolled in the workflow\n2. Find all other contacts associated with that Company Name\n3. Pull the \"custom_date_became_sales_qualified_lead\" property for each of those contacts\n4. Find the minimum of each of those custom_date_became_sales_qualified_lead values\n5. Set the minimum custom_date_became_sales_qualified_lead value as a new variable (to later be copied to a Company Property in the workflow)",
