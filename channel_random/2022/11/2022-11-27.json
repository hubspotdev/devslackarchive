I am working on it again today and am unclear how to continue to do this. It does not appear to be linked currently (I tried using the hs create command and it errored). When I used npx hs init it also errored and said \"Programming\\HubSpot\\HubSpot.config.yml already exists\"\n\nI'm not sure quite how to ask/say this, but how do I start it up again?"
