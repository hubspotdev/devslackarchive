Your subscription type might also be a factor.\n\nYou can keep the subdirectory but not the subdomain unless you are migrating your full site to CMS Hub.\n\n&gt; “If you’re keeping part of your website outside of HubSpot, do not connect that subdomain to HubSpot. For example, if your main website is hosted on WordPress at _<http://info.mywebsite.com|info.mywebsite.com>_, you should not connect your _info_ subdomain to HubSpot. Doing so will take down your external content.\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/domains-and-urls/connect-a-domain-to-HubSpot>"
