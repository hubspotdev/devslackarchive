    "text": "<@U6GNQ7JBU> agreed.  I'm talking about being able to assign new labels to custom modules within a flexible column, i.e. if I'm building a \"meet the team\" page, I generally use a flexible column and end up with lots of custom modules within with the same name.  For ease of editing, it would be nice if I could re-name the module at the page level instead of ending up with 20 modules named \"team member\"."
