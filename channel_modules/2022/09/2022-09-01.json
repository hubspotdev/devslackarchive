    "text": "Hi all! Is there a way to use multiple fields or a custom built module to orchestrate the blog-contents (specifically the `post_body` )?\nCore reason is Iâ€™m trying to build up a Blog-Post which consists of multiple sections - not just one Richtext field.\nTrue it may be done effortlessly using the sourcecode view (and include the nesting, structure I need to achieve the goal) thou that would be largely intransparent for editors without html knowledge. And even for experienced once it would require deeper knowledge of the custom built structure used there.\nIts of course possible to simply add a module on blog-post which adds the additional sections (and all other custom built stuff) - thou that would tie the additional content strictly to the post and will make the contents in-exportable (should once come the day the contents needs to be transitioned to separate blog, archive or even completely different bloging solution).\nIt seems that fields carrying `export_to_template_context` are not fetched when creating a csv-export of a blog (even if they are plain text-fields).",
