It is a real real wish for our French site with accents showing up automatically in tag listing pages :confused:\nI see the idea has been submitted.\nBut if any of you reading this also would like it or just in solidarity. Could you please click and vote to get this promoted ???\nThank you\n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Add-option-to-edit-slugs-for-blog-tags/idc-p/660671#M117035>\n*Add option to edit slugs for blog-tags*\nFor customers with content in many different languages, it would be very helpful to customize the slug for blog tags. We currently have tags that includes characters like \"æ,\"ø\", \"å\" which we would like to keep in the tag names, but remove in the slugs. Special characters always need to be encoded in order to be shown on a URL. This means that it can't be avoided unless you use safe URL characters, which are basically english characters, hyphens and underscores. Therefore, it would be great to have the option to make blog tag names with special characters, but have slugs where we can replace them with safe URL characters."
