My client has their products on Shopify and the other pages of their website is hosted on HubSpot. I know there's no cross platform compatibility between the two with searchbar functionality but, say if someone types the product name - based on keyword, can I create a redirect to the Shopify url? Can't seem to find a doc or post anywhere on that..\n\nie. 'iPhone' &gt; redirect to iPhone products on Shopify url",
