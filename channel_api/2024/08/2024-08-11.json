    "text": "Hi, my team is building a public app that analyzes a call and changes the call notes once it is in HubSpot. We typically know what the call is through call id and we take the recording of the call through hs_call_recording_url. However we just found out that this specific property is sunsetting. We are not quite sure what the alternative is here. We need to be able to have the recording url in order to transcribe, understand the video, and provide our own analysis. Thanks in advance!\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/new-recording-transcripts-api-replaces-hs_call_recording_url-for-call-engagements>"
