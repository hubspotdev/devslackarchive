    "text": ":wave: Hi everyone! Glad to be here. I have a question if anyone can help. I've created an app using my dev account. And created a test user. When my test user is installing the app, after the first prompt the second one redirects too fast and I cannot catch it. Nonetheless, I have that app listed in my connected apps on the Test user.\nWhen I try to create workflow I do not see that app in the list and cannot find it. I've created custom action for my app using postman, and I got 201 response. So that part should be fine. But I still cannot see my app in the workflow. Can anyone help with this issue?"
