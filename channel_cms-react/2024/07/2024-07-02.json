    "text": "We're launching a website rebuild later today :partying_face:, and looking back on it, we were able to get a lot of cool stuff done due to cms-react. No offense to the HubL+JS+CSS approach, but that would have been much more of a slog and harder to support long term to boot. I'm so thankful y'all opened it to the public while it's still in beta. Huge props to everyone who made this possible! :pray:  (And yes, it has its rough edges and the documentation has a bit to go, but I'm hopeful those will get improved over time. :slightly_smiling_face:)"
