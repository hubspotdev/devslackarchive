Two questions: *1.)* Do you have an opinion on which of these works best with HS CMS, and *2.)* In what capacity have you used them (i.e. import vue.js into page templates as needed, or somehow able to integrate Vue CLI build?)",

    "text": "Hi Doug,\n\nI’ve used vuejs on several client projects. I think it works great with HubSpot. React however does not or atleast would be harder to work with.\n\nVue is made to be able to be sprinkled in, react more wants possession of most of the page.\nVue also doesn’t need to be compiled, you can for extra performance, but it works without it, making it so you can work with it in custom modules inside the design manager(which works great if not everyone is set up to work locally). Also since Vue plays atleast kinda nice with other libraries, jQuery loading from another module likely won’t ruin your day\n\nAngular - I haven’t used on a HS project, couldn’t honestly say."
