That way, if you ever change email service providers, you don't find yourself accidentally emailing contacts.\nwe already have spam traps on our list, but there is recourse. Expensive, time-consuming recourse. could try to re-confirm your whole email database. Asking people to re-confirm that they want to receive emails from you will likely result in a sharp decrease in the size of database, but it will certainly help you ensure you're only left with the people who want to be on your list. It's a drastic measure, to be sure, but if you know you've generated contacts in illicit ways in the past and are looking to change your ways, it's one way to ensure you're starting out with a clean slate."
