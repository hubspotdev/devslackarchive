We've been exploring lots of ways to do this \"safely\" and we hope as much as you that we can support this!\n\nIf anyone wants to nerd out on the details, I'm always happy to oblige :joy:. Just say the word.\n\nOtherwise, I can tell you we are _definitely_ digging into this stuff and want it pretty badly too."

That's so helpful and really helps the team prioritize things better. This will always be more effective than just asking for tooltips.\n\nAnd <@U02F2QPB4P8> a developer after my own heart, always digging for clues! For real, I respect that. It's a way of life :joy:"

    "text": "Hi Magnus, there are a few things that you can try here.\n\n1. Add labels to your inputs and selects. That will make your form more consistent with all other forms inside HubSpot \n2. if you really really don't want labels, wrap everything in flex component with direction flex. You can control the spacing using gap\n```    // example 1\n    &lt;Form&gt;\n      &lt;Select label=\"select\" /&gt;\n      &lt;Input label=\"Input1\" /&gt;\n      &lt;Select label=\"select2\" /&gt;\n      &lt;Input label=\"Input2\" /&gt;\n      &lt;Input label=\"Input3\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/Form&gt;\n  );```\n```    // example 2\n    &lt;Form&gt;\n      &lt;Flex direction=\"column\" gap=\"sm\"&gt;\n        &lt;Select /&gt;\n        &lt;Input /&gt;\n        &lt;Select /&gt;\n        &lt;Input /&gt;\n        &lt;Input /&gt;\n      &lt;/Flex&gt;\n    &lt;/Form&gt;```"
