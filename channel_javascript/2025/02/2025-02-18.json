Seems styling isn’t being applied I have been able to track down some errors in the console log referencing ‘application/json’ not being supported. I’m very baffled at what it could be referencing. Any help would be appriciated.\n\nRefused to apply style from ‘<https://www.theoperationscompany.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hub_generated/module_assets/1/142712586671/1735860358381/module_th-hero-2.min.css>’ because its MIME type (‘application/json’) is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.",
