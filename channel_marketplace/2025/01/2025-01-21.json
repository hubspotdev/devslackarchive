    "text": "I have a question. I see on the marketplace there is an app by HubSpot called <https://app.HubSpot.com/ecosystem/48973257/marketplace/apps/twitter|Twitter>. Why is it even on the marketplace when Twitter integration is part of the core offering of the social media dashboard? Does it give you something more? Does it also imply that anyone can create the UI equivalent of this Twitter app using UI extensions? I'm asking because I'm interested in creating a Bluesky integration and want to know how far I can go in terms of emulating the existing Social media capabilities?",
