Permission:  would like the ability to users, groups edit access to certain dbs.  My specific need case is i have a client who has an app with a system status page.  They want someone to be able to toggle the system status as well as select from some predefined language.  The client wants to separate the copy so that this person cannot edit the copy.  (dont ask me why.  kid screwed up :slightly_smiling_face: ).  So ideally, i would add the copy to another database and use the foreign id so the kid could select from a dropdown of the predefined text."
