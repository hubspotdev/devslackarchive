I'd like to add that this would be used internally within HubSpot. I'm considering using serverless to build a reactive management system because GraphQL in server-side rendering isn't very dynamic.\ncc <@U01QVR44MEY> <@U03FJQPSC0Y>",

    "text": "Thanks a lot, Carter. How would you go about creating a dynamic reserved area on HubSpot? Because the GraphQL limit is a bit restrictive.\nI know that if I choose to go with server-side rendering, the queries donâ€™t cost, but the problem is that the reserved area would become a bit old-fashioned due to the loading times (even simply for pagination, etc.) <@U01QVR44MEY>"
