    "text": "Hi everyone, I'm making a custom tab card module (the custom bit is that as well as a tab label, there is an icon) for my marketing team and they want more than just a rich text area within the tab, and what they want for each tab might vary. My first thought was to add a drag and drop area to allow them to drag in whatever modules they want, but then I discovered that modules within modules aren't supported. Is there another way of doing this, or do I have to duplicate code and add choice fields to allow them to select the modules they want to include?"

I can't seem to get this to work, I'm very very new to HubSpot so I am having a hard time figuring out if its a HubSpot issue or if I just haven't figured it out yet",
