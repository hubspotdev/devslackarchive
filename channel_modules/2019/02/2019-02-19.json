    "text": "Unfortunately, the HubSpot Advanced Menu/Nav is currently the most neglected element of the HubSpot CMS. The best thing to do if you HAVE to build it from scratch and make it user friendly would be to make your own custom module with your own nav markup. It would be janky but you could reasonably show the client how to update the module in Design Manager if you used repeater fields. They woudn’t have to actually update the code, but they would have to be in Design Manager to update the global module. Best thing I can think of outside of hacking HubDB together. Otherwise, you’re loading their advanced menu and then writing your own JS to deconstruct and rebuild it (which doesn’t sound pleasant)."
