I learned that the list it uses is <https://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect-tracking-protection/blob/master/services.json#L6745|this one>.\nIt does not make any sense that `react-combined.mjs` and `island-runtime.mjs` are served from a domain that is already known to be flagged in the protection tracker as those are fundamental files to be able to run CMS-React. In my case, I have an Island that handles the navigation (amongst other things) and that it does not show when trackers are blocked.\nI am not sure who can handle this, opening an issue with support with such complex topic can be a nightmare."
