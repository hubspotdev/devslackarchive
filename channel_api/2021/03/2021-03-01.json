The implication seems to be that it uses 3-legged authorisation, which means a (human) user will be required to verify which scopes the app gets access to.\nWhat I really need is 2-legged authorisation, because the app I have in mind is headless.\nCan anyone offer me some insight as to whether 2-legged authorisation is supported?",
