    "text": "Hello! I’ve got a question about workflows or maybe this isn’t something that’s even suitable for workflows. I would like every ticket to have certain properties copied to it from the contact it was created from. I have made some rudimentary ones in the UI but they seem to only trigger once so if I change a property in the contact it won’t reflect this in the ticket unless I manually re-enroll the contact. Is there a better way of doing this?",

I am trying to do that from webpack-serverless but the request is time-out after 20 sec, which is obvious.\nActually I am trying to perform a cron job to sync my data with Algolia Search. but we can not use its library directly in workflow custom codec. Therefore by using serverless-webpack I am calling Algolia-Search Api. What I am thinking is that to create a workflow with schedule and call the serverless to finally update the data to Algolia. Is there any flaw in my approch?",
