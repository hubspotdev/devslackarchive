    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nOur client has asked us to integrate an external form to HubSpot backend and add some degree of customisation tools.\nThe client wants to have the form included into the menu on the left-hand side along with the parameters ( e.g. the size of the box) so that a non-tech user would be able to add the form to any page of the website.\n\nAt the moment the external form is a piece of code that needs to be embedded into the website. As you understand it can only be done by a developer. The goal is to simplify the process so that the client himself will be able to do it just by choosing the form from the menu.\n\nCould anyone please let me know if this is possible?\n\nThank you."
