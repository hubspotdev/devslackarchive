    "text": "We use stair step pricing similar to described. I looked at using quotes with separate line items, but ended up just creating a calculated field on deals that takes number of employees (the unit of tiers for us) and gives a single price figure.\n\nI did previously solve for individual tier rates, by having the tier rates as custom fields on the deal, which were pre-filled on creation with the rack rate, but could be overridden. Iâ€™ve since moved away from that and just given the ability to override the overall price as nobody was adjusting individual tier rates in our case."
