    "text": "Hello HubSpot Community,\nI’m encountering an issue with the HubSpot API.\n\nI’ve set up an OAuth app where users can sign in and grant permissions to my app.\nUpon successful authentication, HubSpot sends a code to my backend, which I then exchange for a refresh token.\n\nWhile this process has worked seamlessly for over 200 users, I’ve recently observed that some users, despite having the correct permissions, are unable to connect.\nUpon inspecting my logs, I noticed an error associated with the `/oauth/v1/token` endpoint. This is where I attempt to exchange the received code from HubSpot for a refresh token. The error details are as follows:\n\n```\"correlationId\": \"a03b9ff5-06b4-4f2a-af19-f45f1b5c71e4\",\n\"message\": \"missing or unknown auth code\",\n\"status\": \"BAD_AUTH_CODE\"```\nI’ve searched the forum for insights but haven’t found a solution.\n\nHas anyone experienced this or have any suggestions on how to resolve it?\nThank you in advance for your assistance!"
