The impacted account and its associated administrators will receive an email notification with further instructions and links to remediate.\n&gt; See documentation for more information.\nIt will deactive the token which means that any workflows who have the old token won't work anymore correct?",

Have a question regard of `hs_searchable_calculated_*` mentioned on <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/api/crm/search>\nFollowing this description I should be able to use calculated property\nBut this pattern is not correct, in reality it's following\n```'mobilephone' =&gt; 'hs_searchable_calculated_mobile_number',\n'phone' =&gt; 'hs_searchable_calculated_phone_number',```\nMay I know if there is a specific named calculated property for standard property `fax`?\nAnd also this description is confusing, I'd prefer if you change it to follow real behavior.\nThank you in advance :blush:"
