I can get all Contact properties, but I wonder how to get all Deals properties that are associated with those newly created contacts. So is this correct? 1. Make an API call first to associate Contacts and Deals. 2. Make another call to get the newly created Contacts and their associate Deals. What is the second step request should look like? I used the Search Contact API but what should be the filers?",
