    "text": "Hello group.\nI'm struggling with changing navigation in the header. I changed in settings, but it is not showing in the header global module.\nI looked in HTML+HubL but I can't find anything but style modules.\nHowever I found some field groups that contain some text items, but they contain the same word.\nAs I already built a header in Elementor Pro is there any way to export it into HubL and switch the existing one?\nAlso, I have a mess with different types of templates inside Marketing Pro. One type of templates are line coded, other are drag-and-drop. When I asked HS support, they said that the only way is to build new landing pages and define template.\nThe goal here is to unify header and footer as a global modules  for all pages and templates, and put landing page templates to be drag-and-drop.\nIf you need more details or to visualise my problem, let me know.\n\nThanks for your thoughts.
