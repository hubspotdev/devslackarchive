If I manually add a stroke color in, it works as expected but something is disconnected still.",

    "text": "Hi guys,\n\nHope you are doing well.\n\nI am new to HubSpot CMS and learned about creating modules.\n\nThe issue that I faced multiple times was a *cache issue* in CMS.\n\n*Summary:*\n\nI've developed a module. Yesterday, I made updates to the field IDs in it. Despite multiple attempts at publishing and clearing the browser cache, the changes aren't reflected in the HTML code. Interestingly, changes to JavaScript were visible. But today both HTML and JS code are not publishing.\n\nThis issue has occurred numerous times, and sometimes the changes appear the next day. I've tested this on multiple machines.\n\nCan anyone help to get rid of this issue? Because the module is a bit complex (having around 50 configuration fields), and recreating it will be a taking task.\n\nThanks for suggesting the solution.\n\nRegards,",
