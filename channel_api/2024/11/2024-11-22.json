I found this resource\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/api/crm/objects/tickets/v1#get-all-tickets>\nwhich suggests that I need to specify the properties I want for the returned tickets to contain.\nPlease help with the following:\n1. Is this the case?\n2. Where can I see a comprehensive list of properties, from which to choose?\n3. Is there a \"Ticket Summary\" property?\nThank You!!"

    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI'm working on tracking email events through the HubSpot API using the following endpoint:\n`<https://api.hubapi.com/email/public/v1/events?recipient=xyz@abc.com&amp;eventType=SENT&amp;limit=100>`\nMy approach is to use the `sentBy` ID as a unique key to match events for `OPEN`, `DELIVERED`, and `SENT`. For example, if the `sentBy` ID appears in both `SENT` and `DELIVERED` or `OPEN` events, it indicates that the email was first sent, then successfully delivered, and eventually opened by the client.\nHowever, I am encountering a discrepancy where HubSpot UI shows the event as \"DELIVERED\", but according to my logic, it should be marked as \"OPEN\".\nCan anyone help resolve this issue, or should I consider using a different API or approach to track these email events more accurately?"
