We are working with an organization that will be running a program that enrolls and manages 2000+ students in a virtual summer math program using Zoom. During the enrollment process, both student and parent information will be recorded, and receive emails. We will create a field to identify if a contact is a parent or student. We need the ability to link family members together. We would like to use Company as the family index, but since families do not have domains (at least most don't :-)) we need to find another way to use Companies or another key to link the family members. My initial thought was to use a custom object to link the family members, but I am not a developer, so I am not sure that is a viable solution. Please DM me if anyone has any ideas or experience solving an issue like this. Thank You!",

As we begin to set up their new blog, I noticed that only the subdomains are available for the URL, rather than the generic HubSpot URL that the website pages are using (since we haven't added the root domain yet as their site is still live).\n\nI was wondering if this is just because we haven't added that root domain yet, or does a blog HAVE to live on a subdomain? (ie <http://blog.mysite.com|blog.mysite.com> vs <http://mysite.com/blog|mysite.com/blog> - we'd prefer the latter if possible).",
