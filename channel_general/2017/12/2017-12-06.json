The issue I was experiencing was not a normal html email development issue it was a strange bug in the way HubSpot was processing the html before sending.\n\nI did figure out what the issue is, and making tweaks to my code resolved the issue. Though  I'm still not sure why HubSpot modified the code. I can reproduce the issue if anyone is interested."

    "text": "So - the simplest way to put it without going into gory details - I used the Zurb Foundation for emails framework to code the email. Then what I was doing was taking the code with everything already inlined and everything and popping it into HubSpot. - that's not the issue.\n\nThe issue specifically has to do with the html that foundation uses for \"spacers\" basically it's a way to get pixel perfect vertical spacing across all email clients. If you place a spacer inside of columns under specific circumstances, it causes whatever process HubSpot has occur upon send (guessing it's part of the css inliner - which in this case shouldn't kick in at all, my css is already inlined and not using the style data attribute). If you place it in the right places it causes HubSpot to drop in some closing table tags which will break the rest of the layout of the email below the spacer.\n\nThere isn't a reason html and css wise why this would occur, there are no unclosed tables, rows or columns. It does not happen in mailchimp, nor when you run a test on the code directly, It also does not happen in HubSpot's preview page and editor. which makes sense because the inliner probably doesn't fully kick in until the email is sent.\n\nSince foundation follows best practices for emails I'm certain others use this same method for vertical spacing"

I wish there were some more features to the new version(I used it back when before they renamed it).\n\nPlus if you develop locally and use the zurb stack for emails, it is hands down the most fun and easy way of building custom html emails. Takes a lot of the headache out of something that used to be excruciatingly painful."
