Is the require relative to macro file's location or the importing file's location?\n\nIf it's relative to the reporting file's location, is there a variable I can use to refer to the macro file's location so I can load a file relative to that location? (If what I'm doing here looks asinine and ridiculous, I'm open to you telling me that in a kind and gentle way. Thanks.)",
