You’ll then add that property to the “properties to include” section at the top of the CCA window.\n\nYou then access that property via the event.inputFields object.\n\nYou’ll probably want to get right of that enclosing array, and store those variables as key:value pairs. Then return it within the callback, something along the lines of:\n\n```callback({outputFields: {\"url\": url, \"queryString\": queryString})```\nSet up data outputs below the editor window of the CCA node matching each of the keys you’ve set for these values.\n\nThat’s more or less, one way you could go about making those values available within the following actions in the workflow."
