I’ve tried this through the attachments but I’ve also created a file upload property and set the files to public. No matter what option I choose, it seems I’m not able to explode those file paths. Ultimately I want to drop them in an email.\n\nAnyone have experience with this or the ability to point me in a different direction?",
