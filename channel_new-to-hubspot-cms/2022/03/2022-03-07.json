Trying to make sure I still understand things correctly since HubSpot is changing quickly.\n\nIn terms of HubSpot Starter CMS, is it still correct that you cannot run the website on the root domain and must use a www subdomain? If so, then if we use the redirect to get from the bare domain to the www subdomain, is there any other opportunity in HubSpot to redirect a second bare domain to the website?\n\nThanks."
