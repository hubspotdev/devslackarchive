This is similar to the issue discussed in this <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C2YH119N2/p1694795440582729|thread>, but I haven't found a solution. For my use case, I want to insert HTML generated by an AI Assistant in the middle of the email. I've tried different approaches, such as a custom module and HTML templates, but none of them worked. I might have made some mistakes. I would appreciate any help. (I have searched on slack and on the web without much luck.)",

For example:\n\n£1 - £1,000 - No - Vacuum\n\nIn the example below - when I use a contact that I know has the matching value, it still returns a \"Not Match\".\n\n{% set type = personalization_token(\"contact.case_study_type\") %}\n\n{% if type == \"£1 - £1,000 - No - Vacuum\" %}\n&lt;p&gt;Matched&lt;/p&gt;\n{% else %}\n&lt;p&gt;Not Match&lt;/p&gt;\n{% endif %}\n\nAny help much appreciated.",

So without the CSS the form will never look the same way like in the preview and most likely never will since the preview is the HubSpot specific one and you want your form to be in your companys look&feel\n\nHave you tried one of the default themes like growth?\n\nIf you're new to HS Development and want to create your own theme(and templates)I highly recommend you to:\n• do the <https://academy.HubSpot.com/courses/cms-for-developers|HubSpot CMS for developer Certification> first\n• Start with the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes/HubSpot-cms-boilerplate|CMS boilerplate theme>\n• Add the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/key-concepts|developer docs> to your bookmarks.
