    "text": "Hi there :wave: I’m in the early stages of starting a company focused on helping companies get the most out of their HubSpot websites called <https://www.cmshubmate.com/|CMS Hub Mate>.\n\nOur customers will often have their own marketing and design resources, but no in-house development and need support, which is where we come in. We provide Unlimited HubSpot website design &amp; development for a fixed monthly cost. There will be varying options and plans available.\n\nI’m looking for 2 or 3 freelancers/contractors to support the growth of CMS Hub Mate. Looking at 5-10 hrs/week to start, but with the chance to grow to much more.\n\nLooking for someone with:\n\n• Excellent written and verbal communication skills\n• Expert knowledge of HubSpot CMS Hub/Content Hub\n• Experience with CMS themes, sections, modules, hubl, HubDB, email templates etc\n• Both design and development background an advantage\n• Knowledge of other HubSpot usage an advantage, eg Reports, Workflows, etc\nIdeally Australian based, but open to other locations who can work the same or similar hours. You must be a freelancer/contractor who is your own business and will invoice for your time.\n\nWe have some great companies on board already and excited to grow and offer fantastic service to more.\n\nPlease reach out if this sounds like something for you. Would love to jump on a call and have a chat!",
