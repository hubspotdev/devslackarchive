Similar to Magnus experience with this, we're still working on finding a good workflow to replicate the production environment into the sandboxes (as it requires importing a handful of records and their associated custom objects) and taking note of all the different custom object IDs and the values for things like various pipeline internal IDs. Are there any tutorials that show the suggested workflow for developing with the sandboxes? Thank you!"

Maybe there's good reason, but if not it would make sense to use `propertyName` here instead to keep everything consistent.
