I'm my own HubSpot cms modules, I know how to insert and use different module fields, but I can't find out how to put a image/text field where I can add multiple pairs of these elements to the module, just like the cards in this sprocket rocket module. Could someone give me an advice about how to achieve this feature? Thanks in advance",
