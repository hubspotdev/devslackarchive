E.g. for a button, we always have a link field, a button text field, and a select field (for style variant) grouped together. If we want to do something like and add another style variant option, currently we have to go into each module and add that to each button individually.  HS already kind of does this with certain field types, e.g. the link field that has url, donotfollow, and open in new tab options bundled together. “Field Components” would look like that but allow us to create new bundles that we can globally edit."
