    "text": "I’m wondering if anyone knows why HubSpot took the Flexible Content builder approach for HubSpot CMS?\n\nIn my 20+ years in the webdesign and development world, I have rarely seen clients being able to handle (complex) flexible content builders. Same holds true with content builders for WordPress like Elementor etc.\n\nMy point being that the editors most often (*though not always*) are marketing employees with limited technical knowledge and will in turn often get into scenarios of “broken” or plain weird design results when they are offered too much flexibility/control.\n\nOur approach is to build modules (including some variance for looks and feel) with fixed content fields. We don’t use sections and we don’t use the flexible content builder at all. We build modules that function as entire sections instead - which in turn cuts down on some of the bloat that is being output by HS).\n\nWe find that our clients have a way better experience when they are not able to break anything and we help them maintain the desired look and feel of the website.\n\nWhat are your experiences/thoughts on the subject of the flexible content builder?",

    "text": "I think I’d probably agree that — in practice — flexible content builders on any platform tend to be ineffective for a huge portion of organizations that desire them.\n\nIn my experience, the orgs that tend to be drawn to the flexible content builder are organizations that are looking to cut corners with regards to the kinds of experts that would facilitate the effective and efficient creation of web content (designers, creatives, developers).\n\nPredictably — without those specialists, they go on to build low-quality pages and take an eon to do so. Then, they write off creating new web content as a lost cause and only touch it when absolutely necessary.\n\nThis isn’t universal, of course. Orgs with heavy investment in creative and light-to-moderate investment in development can make great use of freeform page builder functionality. But I find them to be much rarer than orgs which try to avoid any and all dedicated creative/dev support.\n\nAll of that being said: from a sales and marketing perspective, the benefit of the flexible content builder is obvious. When given a “Pepsi Challenge” between a platform with a freeform page builder and a platform without one, non-developers are overwhelmingly going to choose the option that has the page builder. I don’t think I’ve ever done a web platform discovery for a small-to-medium-sized org in which a flexible content builder _isn’t_ counted among their list of ‘must-have’ features.\n\nRegardless of any and all pitfalls that may come from it, the perceived value of a flexible content builder is off the charts. It sells."
