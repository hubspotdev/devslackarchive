I would like to reduce the number of http requests so the page loads up quickly. Is it better in this situation to make use of larger stylesheet files? I like the idea of having specific css included in a module, but I don’t want to be fetching several css files.",

    "text": "I think the best way is to add them into a bundle, using import or include syntax:\n```{% include './path/file.css' %}```\nBut you can still use the CSS section of a module. Those styles are applied as &lt;style/&gt; tags in the head. And this is not that bad as it looks like. Because it doesn't need an additional request, its part of the precompiled html page and server side cached. Multiple script embeds of the same source are also not critical, even if it looks bad as well, because the browser only load them once. If you don't need the styles from the beginning, because it's a popup and invisible by default. You can load CSS asynchronous:\n```&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"file.css\" media=\"none\" onload=\"if(media!='all')media='all'\"&gt;```\nThis works fine and does not influence the page load speed. But I like to hear what other developer experience? Because this is a very good question!"
