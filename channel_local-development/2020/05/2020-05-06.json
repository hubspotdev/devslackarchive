    "text": "Ok, tackling moving off the FTP for managing assets in the filemanager. I previously had a gulp task that optimized images, added them to a temporary folder, uploaded that folder via gulp ftp task, then scrubbed the folder. the reason I had to use a temp folder rather than a master asset dist is I didn't have a way to only upload changed files rather than uploading everything"
