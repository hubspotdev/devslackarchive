I prefer to work locally so I’ve built a tool which helps me do this without having to upload CSS, JS and images to HubSpot. I’d really appreciate some feedback as I’m only using this for the first time today, and it’s the first thing like this that I’ve made so please bear that in mind haha. Many thanks!\n\n<https://github.com/paulca55/HubSpot-local-development>",
