They're interested in moving to Enterprise to host multiple domains and manage everything in one portal. Has anyone had experience with a move like this? I know I can copy templates from one portal to another. How about content and data? I found documentation for exporting (<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/account/export-your-content-and-data>). Is there ability to import all of this data too? Very green here, so looking for some guidance to point me in the right direction.",
