The issues start to occur when we start setting up actions.\n\nThere are a couple of actions that are vital to the workflow:\n\n• Delays\n• Setting contacts as marketing contacts\nIf we set the workflow up as a Contact-based workflow we can set as marketing contact without issue. Of course, this makes sense because it’s Contact-based. We cannot, however, set a delay based on a date property (Expiration Date, specifically) in the license object. The only date properties that are available to us are those related to the contact.\n\nNow, if we set the workflow up as a License-based workflow we can set the delay without issue, but we can not set the associated contact as a marketing contact.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar? Ideally we’d like to keep a Contact-based workflow, but I realize that may not be possible.\n\nJust wondering…\n\n• Is there a way to set a contact as a marketing contact using a custom code module?\n• Is there a way to create/mimic a delay using a custom code module?\nOr maybe there is something else we’re missing. We have our object associations set up, so I don’t think there’s any issue there. Also, we don’t want to write to a custom contact property because a contact can have several/many licenses and that could get messy.\n\nI appreciate any feedback and/or advice.",
