    "text": "Well no answer from HubSpot yet - i tried running a simple \"get associated ID listing\" for quotes on the docuemtnation website which gave me a success in the private app log - but then again, when i run the code in the workflow i also get a \"success\" message, but when it reaches the basicAPI for quote part it fails.\nSo yea still waiting for an update from HubSpot on this :smile:"
