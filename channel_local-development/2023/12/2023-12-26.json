The goal is to show all blog posts (from different blog types) and have a dropdown that lists all tags (Security, Data and Analytics, etc) and filter the posts depending on what the user clicked with multiple tags and also wants a pagination at bottom.\n\nAppreciate if someone can provide solution for above problem."
