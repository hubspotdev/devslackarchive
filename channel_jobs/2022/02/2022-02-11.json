    "text": "Had an interesting interview with a recruiter looking for a HubSpot Engineer (can be fully remote). The job pays good (80k-90K) but they are looking for someone that can do 40 hours a week and Iâ€™m not looking to leave my current job (just contract work). I would be happy to pass a couple people along if you are interested DM me. Qualification they are looking for 1) US based. 2) 5+ as an engineer on a CRM platform (2 years of that HubSpot). 3) Extensive experience with HubSpot integration, Zapier a plus. 4) 5 years experience developing workflows and pipelines. If I get a lot of responses I will choose the best ones based on your linkedIn if you send me a link.",
