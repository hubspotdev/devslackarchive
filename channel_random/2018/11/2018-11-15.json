No adjusting the width of text boxes to eliminate orphans\n3.) Consistent margins and padding around sections and elements.\n4.) Full-width images will be scaling with the screen size\n5.) All elements have to be constrained by rules, there can’t be any (it just looks nice over there in this case) Erase the idea of one-off element styling.\n6.) No random flair elements that sometimes appear behind a random section\n7.) Start with a style guide that outlines the type styles and colors and don’t stray from it\n8.) Don’t try to measure from the baseline of a font.\n9.) Photo filters don’t exist in all browsers\n10.) Think about how everything will stack on mobile.",

    "text": "This is a great list. Only thing I would add is to try and avoid raster layers as much as possible (not 100% that that's the right way to phrase that, but it's the best I can think of right now). For example, create a rectangle or other shape with a fill property rather than creating a new pixel layer, selecting an area, then filing in a color or gradient. Makes it way easier to get the true color values, and move things if we need to. Another example, instead of cropping an image in photoshop, create a mask to hide the excess rather than deleting it all together.\n\nOh, and paragraph text should be wrapped paragraph text, not a bunch of soft breaks where they look good :sweat_smile: I love it when I copy text out of a PS document and there are &amp;nbsp;s everywhere &lt;/s&gt;"
