    "text": "Hey everyone! We are working on a workflow according to HubSpot will require custom code...\n\nHubSpot calendar meetings has email reminders that you can trigger to send reminders 24 hours before the meeting, 1 hour before the meeting etc.\n\nWe would like to create a workflow that will trigger the same reminder, only it will send it through SMS with our Aloware integration. We would like the reminders to send one hour before every meeting.\n\nHubSpot is saying this will require custom code because workflows can only be triggered by a specific dates/times, not something like \"1 hour before\" ... can anyone help with this? Would be greatly appreciated!",
