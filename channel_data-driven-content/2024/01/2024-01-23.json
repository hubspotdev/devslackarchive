    "text": "Hi team, I'm facing a really big issue with GraphQL. I created some serverless functions in a sandbox where I was retrieving associations of deals with custom objects, and everything was fine. However, in production, the association doesn't show up in GraphQL, even though the deals are associated with the custom object. It's just not visible in GraphiQL and the query doesn't work. The only difference is that the association in the sandbox was made manually, while in production it's done through a connector.",
