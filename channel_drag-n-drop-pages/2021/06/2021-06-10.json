When I go to the exact same page and edit in FireFox, I have the \"Section\" and \"Column\" and \"Module\" tabs available for all elements on the screen.\n\nThis was driving me nuts because Chrome is my default browser and I couldn't understand why something so obvious was missing from the editor.\n\nHope that helps someone else."
