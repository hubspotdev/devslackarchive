    "text": "Hi there…I’m wondering if I define a new tag in `JinJava` ….is it possible to have it support single line tag construct and block tags construct?\n\ni.e.\n```{% customTag %} ```\n```{% customTag %}\n{% endcustomTag %}```\nGoing by the  `Tag` interface it seems it’s one or the other but not both? Also if it’s not supported is there plans to support it as `JinJa`  I think supports both constructs. Many thanks in advance.",

Closest example would be the set tag with the support for single line and block usage, but the starting tokens look different, which is how it's able to parse correctly. If you find documentation about it, I could look into it more"

I noticed JinJava was recently updated, can that have anything to do with it? It’s funny, I can output `module.panels` to the browser as json, copy it, set that value explicitly as a new variable, and appending the object works. But anything i try to do directly with module.panels errors out, even adding `|tojson|fromjson`",
