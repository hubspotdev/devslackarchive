    "text": "Hey <@U07GWEYDKFV> -\nA few thoughts, not sure if any of this is relevant, but hope this helps!\n1. The Conversations widget requires the <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/reports/install-the-HubSpot-tracking-code|HubSpot Tracking code> to load (unless you're using the mobile SDK, mentioned below), so a webview would need to load a page that fires the tracking code, and then can load the widget. Widget load is controlled by URL or query params (i.e. \"load on this page with this URL or param)\n2. There's a Conversations SDK that gives you some control using JS to load the widget - <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/api/conversations/chat-widget-sdk>\n3. If you're in a mobile app, there's a Chat mobile SDK (both iOS and Android are available) - <https://github.com/HubSpot/mobile-chat-sdk-ios>\n4. I have this video from a few years ago that shows using the Conversations JS SDK on a page, that is then loaded in a webview in iOS. <https://www.loom.com/share/dca294a8a02c4ce684da02fc10bd81a2?sid=dea79abe-ed4d-40a1-8654-f97c178f056e>"
