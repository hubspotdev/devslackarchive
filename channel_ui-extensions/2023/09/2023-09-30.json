I'm trying to follow the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/blog/hello-world-creating-your-first-react-graphql-custom-card-for-HubSpots-crm|React + Graph QL extension guide> on the dev blog. I'm stuck on step 2. When I run `hs project create` and choose the \"getting started\" template, I'm missing some files.\n\nThe article is saying my files should look like what's on the left, but mine look like the ones on the right. Specifically I'm missing the extensions folder. Anyone know why this might be happening?",
