    "text": "Hi everyone! My company, Cambium Advisors, is open-sourcing the HubSpot application development framework we’ve been building for the last nine months. The Framework allows developers to create enterprise-grade applications for HubSpot quickly. It creates fully serverless applications in AWS and includes the infrastructure necessary to support multi-tenant OAuth for HubSpot, HubSpot webhooks, and scripts to simplify the management of custom actions. The framework is ideal for new projects, but existing projects can benefit from borrowing ideas we use.\n\nIt has already been incredibly useful to us in development. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement and further evolution. We’d like to invite developers from the HubSpot community to take a look at the framework, try it, offer ideas – and contribute!\n<https://www.cambiumadvisors.com/blog/cambium-advisors-open-sources-its-proprietary-HubSpot-app-development-framework|https://www.cambiumadvisors.com/blog/cambium-advisors-open-sources-its-proprietary-HubSpot-app-development-framework>"
