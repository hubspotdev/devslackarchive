    "text": "I was just about to post this question and see <@UDFTHC6PK> posted similar a week ago and got no responses. We use the HubSpot CMS and our Google Pagespeed Insights scores are terrible. By far the biggest problem with our page load is unused JavaScript and most of them scripts added by HubSpot.\nThe biggest culprit is from `<http://connect.facebook.net|connect.facebook.net>` which I assume is just because we have our social account connected in HubSpot. Other big problems though are from `<http://js.hsforms.net|js.hsforms.net>` and `<http://js.hsleadflows.net|js.hsleadflows.net>` for example.\n\nHow is anyone handling these to improve page speed and lighthouse metrics? Is there a way to `async` or `defer` these scripts that HubSpot loads automatically?",
