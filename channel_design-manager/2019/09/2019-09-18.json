    "text": "Hi All. So I don't have a developer background and am trying to create new templates under the Design Tools section in HubSpot. I'm pretty much done with it but I have this annoying problem with the CTA buttons which I can't solve and I think it has something to do with the .css files that we have for the page. The problem is that the CTA 1) won't change even if I change it in the content editor side and 2) It keep hiding itself behind other modules even though it is part of another module group. Attaching picture. Any thoughts or suggestions more than welcome and much appreciation and thanks in advance.",
