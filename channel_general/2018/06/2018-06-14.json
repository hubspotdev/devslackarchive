    "text": "Hi guys,\nI had a uncommon request from one of our clients this morning. \nThere is a custom form (non-HubSpot) which sign visitors to their external app and they want to add a hidden field that monitors the quality of leads, basically they want to see where that visitor came from. \nIs there a json variable that has that kind of data that I can use to populate the value of that hidden form?\nwhat do you suggest?\nThanks",

I have never implement tabbing before and I tried it in HubSpot, but it doesn’t work.\n\nDo you have any tip? Hope you can give me script, CSS, or “step by step-manual” :innocent: :pray: \nThanks :slightly_smiling_face:"
