    "text": "Hope this is the right channel for this, I'm trying to only show certain content in my rich text module to contact with a property set, for contact without this property I want it to display other content, since we can use personalization tokens and hubl in rich text modules it should be a possibility to do this with an if statement. ive tried the following, unfortunately this was not the solution\n\n```{% if personalization_token('contact.segment__c') !== \"\" %}\nShow personalized content\n{% else %}\nShow generic content\n{% endif %}```\nI do feel like im on the right path with this, any ideas?",

The thank you page will then have the following message\n\n\"Thank you for your pricing request for ISM\"\n\nWhen a visitor has a cookie blocker and/or denied our cookie bot, it will be unable to show the property, when leaving it blank however it will say\n\n\"Thank you for your pricing request for\"\n\nThis is not grammatically correct because of the trailing \"for\" so i wanted to create an if statement to also get rid of the 'for'\n\nI hope this sheds more light on what exactly am trying to achieve"
