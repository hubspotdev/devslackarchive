    "text": "Hey people, I am currently updating a clients page to the new jquery version. Everything worked pretty well thanks to the HS Guide. On one Page there is a HS Module called image gallery. Using this module seems to automatically import an old jquery version. :thinking_face:(see img)\nIf I remove the gallery module the jquery import disappears too. Is this coming from HubSpot or is there some custom code doing this which I haven't found yet?",
