    "text": "&gt; Are you just looking for custom step increments?\nNah. For instance, you have 4 number fields, the first one defaults to 2. I want the default for the second field to be 4 (2x the first field), and the third field to be 8 (2x the second field), and the fourth field to be 16 (2x the third field). So if you change the value of the first field to 6, the default values for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fields would update to 12, 24, and 48 respectively. Those are simply for the defaults though, you can manually override the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fields at any time. This is already doable with inherited field values, minus the multiplication bit."
