    "text": "That is correct, I use Vite in my newer builds but depended on Webpack for my compile tasks. I'd have a `main.ts` that managed my JS imports and dependencies, a PostCSS process that setup Tailwind in a `main.css` file, and then `module.js` files in my module folders that would import the `module.css` to be compiled.\n\nI will say, I will likely be moving from Tailwind to Lit web components, so much of my styling process is changing."
