    "text": "Fun news - ATAK Interactive has entered the HubSpot CMS theme game!\n\n<https://ecosystem.HubSpot.com/marketplace/website/agile-theme-by-atak-interactive-inc>\n\nSome may not know this, but ATAK is an acronym for Accountable, Tenacious, Agile, and Kind. This is how we run our company and foster our client relationships.\n\nWhen we decided we were going to begin designing themes, we wanted our first foray to showcase what we believe is the biggest need for companies building on a theme - flexibility. Hence, today we're proud to announce that the AGILE theme is up and open for business!\n\nWe're giving away 10 free themes to our first customers to get some user feedback. We're also taking private meetings with agencies and other channel partners interested in an affiliate relationship. It's an exciting time and we hope we've built a framework that makes designing your next beautiful website an easy and rewarding experience.\n\nIf anyone wants a walk through, feel free to DM me and we'll get you \"beneath the hood\" so you can see just how flexible and powerful the AGILE HubSpot CMS theme really is!"
