Which means that it will only filter through items that are already on the page.\n\nSo if youre loading them in as the user scrolls via ajax or fetch you will need to re-fetch the blog posts with the correct filter that was assigned on click.\n\nIt may be easier to load them all via hubl to start with and do a “fake infinite scroll” — hide them and reveal them as the user scrolls down page. That way they are all there and ready for Isotope to do their thing."
