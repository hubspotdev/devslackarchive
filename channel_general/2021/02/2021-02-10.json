We are having an issue where the HubSpot tracking code is installed on both our marketing website and our product - <http://app.userleap.com|app.userleap.com> - but it seems like the tracking isn't working right on the product. For example, I can't see webpage views in HubSpot when they're in-product webpage views.\n\nAny ideas what might be going on here or how to troubleshoot? Thank you."
