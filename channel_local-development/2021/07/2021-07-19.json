    "text": "Hello all, I am currently looking to fetch current templates that are being used by my company so that I can implement lazy loading on our images for SEO purposes. I was hoping to be able to use the design tools that live in the CMS, but the content is not editable. This is the issue the developers for me have had. Instead of actually adding helpful classes for things like CSS and JavaScript. Does anyone have a solution for working on live pages in a local environment? To the best of my understanding you can go about cloning them, but after that I do not understand how to pull the files down locally so I can work on them in VS code."
