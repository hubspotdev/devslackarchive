Weâ€™d like to have that when running a workflow without having to make an additional API call (we can do `dealname` or `subject` for deals/tickets, but seems like it is not possible for a custom object). Or is there some hidden `hs_primary_display_property` like `hs_unique_creation_key` to use instead?"
