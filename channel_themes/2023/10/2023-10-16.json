We noted your feedback and have released an embedded HTML version that mirrors the legacy CTA tool functionality. Along with this we are working on a migration tool to allow you to easily copy your legacy CTA over to the new tool, and update any dependencies that use it. We are also actively working on addressing the GTM issues with our iframe versions. Let me know if you have any feedback on the new HTML version!"
