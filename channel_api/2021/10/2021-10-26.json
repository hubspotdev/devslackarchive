    "text": "Another import question - I'm currently running into an issue where when I import a contact that already exists, the 'marketing status' is being set to either true/false (depending on the import request marketableContactImport flag).  My current workaround for this is to set that flag as false, specify 'skipIfKnownColumn' on the 'hs_marketable_status' column mapping and finally specify the 'hs_marketable_status' property as true for all outgoing records.  This -appears- to avoid changing existing user's flags while continuing to set new users with the marketable status.  Does this sound like the correct / supported approach, or is there some better option I'm missing?  This isn't an issue when we use the standard batch based contact updates, but those are too slow for my use case."
