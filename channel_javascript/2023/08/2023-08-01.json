    "text": "Hello, I am on a shopify store, I have an embeded HubSpot form and I'm trying to automplete one of its inputs with Google API Places. The script loads, and it works if I press \"down\" arrow, the input gets autocompleted but the dropdown won't show. I tried it on a different input of that page, outside the form and it works completely fine. The error I get in the console is \"InvalidValueError: not an instance of HTMLInputElement\". Does anyone encountered this issue before?",
