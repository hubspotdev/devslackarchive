    "text": "Hey Austin â€” this typically means that you have 2 modules that youre trying to put next to one another but they are either not in columns or do not have the appropriate width attribute specified. So they are assumed to be 12 columns wide. The issue seems to be with your 3rd module which is set to span 12 cols. Your 4th module is set to 6."

    "text": "Hey <@U0387GNCQF4> - I'm running into the same issue. One way I got around it was to add a new section for the testimonial module even though the tutorial says to put the code inside the main section (assuming you're following the testimonial module example). Example code below was added after the main end_dnd_section. In order to add the module into the grid like the example they are using, I believe you would need to add the module to the multi-column-content.html file. Hope that helps.\n``` {% dnd_section %}\n  {% dnd_module path= \"../modules/testimonial.module\" %}\n  {% end_dnd_module %}\n {% end_dnd_section %}```"
