    "text": "I’ve recently had the unfortunate luck of being roped into some HubSpot email development. Currently running into an issue that must be user error on my part when working with HubSpot’s default text and image modules. The first screenshot consists of 2 separate text modules + 1 image module. Both of them have their left and right padding values set to 32.\n\n*The issue* - there seems to be a HubSpot enforced padding value assigned at a ~mobile breakpoint, 20px left and right. However, it isn’t consistently applied. It’s applied to the text modules, but not the image. And so, the mobile image ends up maintaining the 32px padding.\n\n*Question* - What’s the best way to bring this image in line with the text fields on mobile, without creating custom modules to do so?\n\nI’d appreciate any help you good people could provide.",
