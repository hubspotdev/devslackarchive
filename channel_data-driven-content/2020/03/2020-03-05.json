Whether you use javascript or hubl, I think the idea is the same.  You need to gather the product types for the supplier on your item form page.  That should be possible with a query on your supplier table for the specific supplier."

You're saying I can customize the form's muti-select field in HubL? or are you suggesting passing the item's type tags from HubL to Javascript. If I can avoid using javascript it would make me happy."
