    "text": "How does the HubSpot search api work behind the scenes? Anyone know? It appears that it doesnt search concatenated strings. But will break the multi-word term into individual word searches. For example “Introduction to CTS” returns every blog post because every blog post contains the word “two” and mentions the company name “CTS”. However searching just “introduction” returns only two results… Is this expected behavior?",

No matter how you send the query it will always search the words seperately, but rank with results with the combined phrase higher of course. And you can't change the way the search is processed. it's a very underwhelming api, might be time to implement something like algolia"
