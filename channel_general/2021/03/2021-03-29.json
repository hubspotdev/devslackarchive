Hopefully you could help with some of my questions.\n\n• Can I still use sound/music in the background\n• Can I edit the cursors to be custom in different sections?\n• If I wanted the cursor to \"reveal\" a background image as it moves over it, is that doable.\nApologies if these are things that are not hindered by HubSpot.\n\nThanks in advance.",
