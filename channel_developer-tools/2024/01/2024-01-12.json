    "text": "Hello all!\n\nWill HubSpot cookie consent be updating accordingly to consent mode v2 soon?\n\nAlso I have this doubt as to what's the best thing to do, as in - if its better to use HubSpot for cookie management and ad pixel management and GTM (integrated with HubSpot) with GA4 and other external analytics and ad scripts since HubSpot cannot automatically block cookies from scripts you manually place on the page\nOR\nManage all the ad scripts and other external analytical tool scripts within GTM (integrated with HubSpot) including GA4 and using HubSpot just for cookie management.\n\nBut what concerns me is how does HubSpot treat GTM? is it analytical or advertising? Does HubSpot scan all the tags we have in GTM and fire the tags accordingly? (I wish lol)\n\nThank you in advance\n\nCheers\n\n<#CCQ7H31D5|developer-tools> #consentmode #googletagmanager #googleanalytics"
