However, I'm experiencing some issues with Salesforce-linked HubSpot properties and differences in the Metadata vs. Export API. For example, I have some properties that I can see in the Metadata API for Contacts, like:\n\n• `company_linkedin__c`  \n• `created_by__c`  \n• `salesforcelastsynctime`\nHowever, when I try to reference these API names for CRM Export, HubSpot responds that the fields are invalid. What next steps can I take to debug this issue and/or provide a bug report?"
