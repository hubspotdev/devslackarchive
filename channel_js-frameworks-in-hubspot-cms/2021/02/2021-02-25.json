    "text": "My team and I want to build a site in HubSpot with a lot of «extras» like for example custom cursor with custom state, parallax effect for site scroll and images etc… We want to use React, keep as much of HubSpot’s functionality as possible as well as have the ability to use npm packages freely. There is not a lot of info about HubSpot and React yet so we want to hear your thoughts before going all in. Do anyone have any thoughts on how you would do it or have experience with something similar?\nThanks!"

Is the best approach to pull down a new boilerplate for each module I want to build or use the `hs create module {..}` command and keep the modules all in the same project?",
