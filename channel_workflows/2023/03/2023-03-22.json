There were 1056 contacts on my test list, which means that there should be 264 contacts with each number assigned. Unfortunately, they did not split evenly. Here were the results:\noutput 1 --&gt; 296 contacts\noutput 2 --&gt; 259 contacts\noutput 3 --&gt;253 contacts\noutput 4 --&gt; 248 contacts\n\nHow can I fix this?",
