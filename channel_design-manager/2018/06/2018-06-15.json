    "text": "Noticing some unexpected behavior with DM2 fields. Basically, I am using a CTA field and I am checking whether or not a CTA has been selected. Before any CTA has been selected (field has no set default), `{{ module.cta_field is undefined }}` and `{{ module.cta_field is none }}` both return `true`, which is what I would expect. However, when a CTA is added and then removed, both return `false`. The only thing I can get to return true is `{{ module.cta_field == \"null\" }}`. I would expect `{{ module.cta_field is none }}` to return true in this scenario, but it looks like it swaps the cta guid string for the string “null” instead of setting it as an actual null value",
