It worked fine until we sent a link to the client and none of the ajax requests worked. I think it’s because their office firewall strips the headers which include Access-Control-Allow-Origin: mysite.\nObviously I can’t run my code on the same server because it’s hosted by HubSpot and it’s something that you just can’t do.\nDoes anyone have any idea how I can get around this?"

One solution to consider: If you are using the Forms API, you could poll the 'product download' property first using the 'get a contact property' endpoint. This will return the current options available for the property. You could then check the option submitted on the form to see if its part of the current option set. If it is; great POST the form data as you won't need to update the options. If the submitted option doesn't exist on the proprety you could use the 'update the contact property' option first before submitting the form data. Adding API endpoints below for reference:"
