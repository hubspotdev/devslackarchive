    "text": "<@U04M8KXHTNG> Hi Sierra, sorry for missing your message, i appreciate you comming back to this topic. Im currently using the is known trigger for my workflow and is doing it for me so far, so i dont think im going to need to try the beta. Anyway im looking forward to test the event triggers out once they are in the live version. Also, if you ever release a workflows API that allows me to replicate them systematically (something Carter gave me a hint about a couple of months ago), i would be happy to check it out as well. Thanks for your message, cheers!"
