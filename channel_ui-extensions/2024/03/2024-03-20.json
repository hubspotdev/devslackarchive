If the problem continues, contact the app developer for support with this trace ID: [TRACE ID]\", when trying to display our custom CRM extensions. The trace log output contains the error: \"Unable to initialize extension\".\nDoes anyone have any idea what could be causing this issue?\nWe did update our project platform versions to 2023.2 last week but everything tested fine and the issue is very difficult to reproduce on purpose.\n\nThanks",
