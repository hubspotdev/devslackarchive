    "text": "We have multiple automated emails (built using the drag and drop editor) that are used in deal-based workflows. We want to be able to show some dynamic copy depending on the value of a deal property. We could do this by duplicating all of the emails, and checking for this property value in an if/then branch in the workflows, however, I’d like to avoid duplicating the templates if possible. Another thought was using smart content, however in testing this the dynamic copy will display for any deal, even if it’s not applicable to it, as long as the contact is in the list. Is there another way to achieve this dynamic copy without having to duplicate all of the emails?",
