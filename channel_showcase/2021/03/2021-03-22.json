    "text": "Hi Everyone :wave: ... Just wanted to update that CloudFiles is now Live on HubSpot Marketplace (<https://ecosystem.HubSpot.com/marketplace/apps/sales/sales-enablement/cloudfiles>)\n\nWe are very excited to announce this since it makes so much more possible in HubSpot. It enhances file tracking and enables automations directly on file views.\n\nWhile implementing this we realized the plethora of use-cases this can address, not only in sales &amp; marketing but outside for B2C customers as well. We are now on a mission to make secure, insightful &amp; affordable file sharing &amp; analytics available to everyone.\n\nWould love for folks here to try it out and give us some feedback. :slightly_smiling_face:",
