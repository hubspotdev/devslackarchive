Wondering if someone can shed some insight on it.\n\nWithin this module, I've got two field groups which I have labeled `appearance` and `content`.  Now when I edit the module at the page level, I'm seeing something I've never seen before.  The `content` field group is collapsed and when I click it, it takes me into a new pane (similar to editing a repeating field).\n\nAs I said before, I've never seen this before... but I really really like it.  How do I get all my field groups to show up collapsed like this?",
