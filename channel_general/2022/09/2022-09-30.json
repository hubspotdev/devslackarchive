    "text": "Hi folks , I am currently working with a workflow which has custom code for deletion and insertion of records into the custom object . When i test my custom code manually everything works as expected .\nBut i am facing some issue with the workflow , the issues are as follows :\n1. Sometimes the workflow doesn't get executed at all at the scheduled time.\n2. The code for deletion takes place fine , but during insertion it inserts the same set of data multiple times. This behavior is a bit abnormal as sometimes the insertions works correct and sometimes it inserts multiple times .\nDo anyone of you know what could be the underlying issue and how can i get through this?\nIt would mean a lot to me if anyone of you could help !\n\nThank you so much in advance..Happy coding!",

    "text": "Hello All!  I would like to maintain an Active List of Contacts based on their location (lat/long) radius distance from another location (lat/long).  I didn’t see the query capabilities in the Contact API, and it doesn’t seem like you can store location data on a Contact as a new field,  so I created a HubDB table with a contact_id column and I have a custom workflow that keeps this updated when the address changes.  I have written logic that allows a user to search for all Contacts in our account by distance to an address.  I can take this list of Contacts and create a static list… but I was curious if there was a way to setup a custom Active List filter.  I noticed we already had a few third party integrations that have List filters in an `INTEGRATION FILTERS` category.  Where would I find the documentation for creating such a filter?  Is there an easier way?\n\nThank you!"
