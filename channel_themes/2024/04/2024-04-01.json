Navigate to your HubSpot account &gt; Marketing &gt; Files and Templates &gt; Design Tools. Find the template/theme in question, and look for the footer module or HTML file. You can edit the code directly to replace the old logo URL with the new HubSpot Solutions Provider logo URL.\n\nIf you're unable to locate the template or specific file, it might be part of a global footer that's used across multiple templates. Check under 'Content Settings' for global modules."
