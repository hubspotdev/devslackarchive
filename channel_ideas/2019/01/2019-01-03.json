While granted, they are set to noindex with the robots meta, crawlers and seo tools will find these pages and flag hundreds of them depending on the error type. For instance, Moz has a \"Pages with Meta Noindex\" Crawler warning, while this is alright for this instance, Moz pulled back 1,341 errors of this type for one email, mainly because it pulls unique parameters as its own url. Setting a canonical on these, should help this issue. I'm also trying to figure out how in the heck Moz is finding all these urls to begin with as I dont see an area where newsletters are linked",
