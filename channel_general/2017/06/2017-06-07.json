    "text": "Hey <@U3TR96G84>, we've looked at doing this for several clients, but the cost has always turned the client off. There may be a better way to do this, and I'm open to hearing what other partners say, but our solution was going to be to stand up a server just for indexing and returning results using Apache Solr <http://lucene.apache.org/solr/>. You'll then need to skin the search and results and of course charge the client for hosting it. Seems like overkill, I know, but it's fast as hell. \n\nOf course, it would be best if COS had search built in, it seems like something it _should_ do natively. Hint, hint …"
