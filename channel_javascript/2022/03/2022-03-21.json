    "text": "Good morning, I’m a new developer interning for a company who uses HubSpot. I built a tool to model how well their product works with a React front-end. We are looking at options for deployment — I’m wondering if creating a HubSpot module is feasible for this project. The project receives a user’s input, fires calculations (to a python back-end/flask api route) and returns the results of the calculations in the browser. I started looking at the react boilerplate on the website…wanted to float the idea to the community to see if it even seems possible? From the information I’ve read by HubSpot, I can’t tell if the platform supports full scale react apps.",

I have three questions about third party scripts that are loading on our frontend web application as a result of integrating with HubSpot.\nMy questions are as follows:\n1. Why are these scripts injected? The scripts I see appear to be related to Google Leads and LinkedIn. \n2. What are they doing for us — are these scripts servicing a feature that we have turned on in HubSpot? \n3. How do we remove these scripts and what are the consequences of doing so?\nI’ll look forward to hearing from you and I appreciate the help!",
