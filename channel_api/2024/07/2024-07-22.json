    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope you are doing well. We need assistance with an issue that has come up after we transitioned from using Hapikey (v2 version) to a Private App (v3 version) for our API calls. Since this change, we've had trouble tracking Google and Facebook leads in our HubSpot contacts list.\n\nPreviously, using [specific code], tracking for Google contacts worked correctly with the v2 version. However, after switching to the v3 version, the tracking no longer differentiates properly between Google and Facebook leads. Instead, [specific code] seems to aggregate contacts from both sources under a single filter in the HubSpot contacts list, specifically under the \"Original source drill-down 2\" filter option.\n\nCould you help us resolve this issue so that we can correctly track and differentiate leads coming from Google and Facebook separately, as we did before?\n\nYour prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance for your help and support.",

    "text": "Greetings,\nI am attempting to initiate an export through the API. Our account has over 12 million records and I want to export only those created in 2019. I must be doing something wrong: everytime I POST my request, and then look at the status of the export audit page, it says that the numbe3r of records in the export is the 12 million plus records in the account. In other words, the API is registering that I want an export, but it seems to be ignoring my filter. I tested precisely this filter in the search API and it worked correctly (the number of contacts was around 600k). Could someone please tell me what I am doing wrong? Thanks!\nHere's the request:\n\n```curl -X POST \\\n  --url '<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/exports/export/async>' \\\n  --header \"authorization: Bearer $access_token\" \\\n  --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{\n   \"exportType\":\"VIEW\",\n   \"exportName\":\"contacts_2019\",\n   \"format\":\"CSV\",\n   \"language\":\"EN\",\n   \"objectType\":\"CONTACT\",\n   \"objectProperties\":[\n      \"createdate\",\n      \"lastname\",\n      \"firstname\",\n      \"email\"\n   ],\n   \"publicCrmSearchRequest\" : {\n      \"filterGroups\" : [\n         {\n            \"filters\":[\n               {\n                  \"propertyName\":\"createdate\",\n                  \"operator\":\"BETWEEN\",\n                  \"highValue\":\"1577836800000\",\n                  \"value\" : \"1546214400000\"\n               }\n            ]\n         }\n      ] },\n   \"sorts\":[\n      {\n         \"propertyName\":\"createddate\",\n         \"order\":\"ASC\"\n      }\n   ]\n}'```\n",

I think it's because the API expects there to be an additional set of filters, which in the search api would be OR'd with the first set of filters. But here I've only got the one set.
