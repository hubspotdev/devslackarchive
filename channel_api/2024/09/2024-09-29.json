However, Iâ€™ve noticed that replies sent by contacts from their mobile devices or external email accounts are not being fetched.\nIs there a way to capture these replies in HubSpot? If so, could you please share the approach or API endpoints that can help in retrieving those replies?"

We haven't received any feedback yet and would really appreciate your insights or suggestions on how to resolve this. Has anyone else faced similar issues or found a workaround?\n\nAlso, is there a *Discord* community for HubSpot? If so, please let us know.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!"
