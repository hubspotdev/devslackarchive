I've already researched about it and contacted both supports, but until now I haven't had success, unfortunately! :confused:\nDoes someone here had some similar experience? And/Or could you please help me with that? Thank you in advance!",

You can think of it the same way as HubSpot not needing an integration to work with mice."
