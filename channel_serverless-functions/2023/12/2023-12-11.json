    "text": "Hey all - does anybody know if when using the custom code workflow actions, if I were to make a call to an external API it comes from a static IP or a dynamic IP?\nThe developer of a platform we want to connect with is requesting the IPs to whitelist but I cannot find this info anywhere. From what I gather AWS Lambda is used to run the serverless function but without knowing HubSpot's internal Lambda set up it's hard to know how it's configured. Thanks in advance!"
