I hope this ok to post here - it’s relevant to the marketplace :)\n\nOur company (<http://revops.io|revops.io>) is in the process of taking our product’s HubSpot integration to market. We’re looking for a few more beta users to get feedback from. If you have a Sales Ops or RevOps person at your company, and are willing to give us some feedback on how we could tweak the integration before launch, I’d love to chat (<http://go.revops.io/HubSpot-beta|go.revops.io/HubSpot-beta> for more info).",
