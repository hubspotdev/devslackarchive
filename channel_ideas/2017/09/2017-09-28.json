    "text": "<@U2H3TT8F2> apologies for the slow response. I think you have some good thoughts here. This sort of all revolves around expanded user permission sets in blog authorship. Almost as if someone is \"assigned\" (different than author) a post, as in they are currently responsible for it. Some permissions would revolve around access to, and the ability to filter for posts your assigned to. I do also like the idea of approvals wrapping in to the composer to take comments a step further. \n\nThank you for the feedback, I will certainly share with my team"
