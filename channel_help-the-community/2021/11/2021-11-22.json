The new website is going to be hosted on HubSpot and we were wondering if there was a way to port an existing website into the new HubSpot account under a subdomain (i.e. <http://Company1.com|Company1.com> will become <http://company1.company2.com|company1.company2.com>). Would anyone be able to give us any tips?",
