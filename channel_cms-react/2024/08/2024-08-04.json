We have a 32mb internal component library, as well as some other dependencies that are getting us to that limit. Our actual project was less than 1mb the last time we checked with HubSpot.\n\nWould love an analysis tool from HubSpot that could help shed light on the bundle size, if that’s something that could be added in future."
