    "text": "hi all, I'm looking for some help with sending transactional emails via workflow\n\nI'm trying to create a setup where:\n1. order is placed in WooCommerce\n2. the contact (or maybe deal??) is enrolled into a workflow via the API\n    a. maybe directly, or a contact/deal property is changed which triggers them to enrol\n3. I can add delays into the workflow, and other actions, as per normal workflow stuff\n4. I add an action into the workflow to send the transactional order confirmation email\n    a. this would contain all products ordered, so number of rows in the order summary would depend on what was purchased\n5. the email is sent when the action is reached in the workflow\nthe current setup is we do it all via the API, and send the transactional with the order info, and iterate through the products to add rows in the order summary, directly - what we want to do instead is have it done in a workflow\n\nis this possible?",
