    "text": "We have a number of chatflows, but when our sales team is not in the office, we use some custom code to tell the user that they are out of the office. In the inbox, the sales team then answers the chat and they are *supposed to* then email the chat transcript to the recipient like this screenshot shows.\n\nHowever, in the chat, and on the contact record, there is no record of any kind indicating that this email was sent (even when it *is* sent)... So my question for y'all is this... has anybody figured out a way to track whether the people your team chats with actually have completed that requirement of emailing the user the chat transcript? It feels like a sizable oversight by HubSpot to have an email sent to a contact which is not recorded on the contact record.",
