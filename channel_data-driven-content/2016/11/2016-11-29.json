The icon/option on import clearly states \"Replace all rows in the HubDB table with rows from the file.\"\n\nEven if we try to map the three 'hs_' columns. Can we get this fixed ASAP please?! It's been an issue for over a month now. Creating a new table every time is NOT an option, there are too many pages/coded files relying on the table ID to go back and change them to a new ID every time we need to bulk update a table."
