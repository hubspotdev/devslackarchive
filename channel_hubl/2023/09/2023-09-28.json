    "text": "Joining in here as I came asking this same question. I have a blog template where existing pages are fine to edit, but when I create a new post, the body content area seems to have a width of 0 and I can't type in it. Haven't seen this before, but thought some default content would do the trick. The |default item doesn't affect the editor view, so I need some other solution. Any ideas??"
