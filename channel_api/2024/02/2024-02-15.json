    "text": "Hi,\nI have implemented the authentication with my HubSpot application. Now I want to set some values as global variables against based on the response of the authentication API. How can I achieve this thing ? As based on auth token user will be able to watch his stored data in the custom actions forms.\n\nExample : When user tried to install my hub app then a page appears which asks for API Key and this api key is sent to my server to verify and in response we get user information. Now I want to save this user auth token in HubSpot application somewhere as global variable so that custom code actions of my HubSpot application will work smoothly based on that auth token for each user. How can I achieve this thing. Please guide."
