I found this resource\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/api/crm/objects/tickets/v1#get-all-tickets>\nwhich suggests that I need to specify the properties I want for the returned tickets to contain.\nPlease help with the following:\n1. Is this the case?\n2. Where can I see a comprehensive list of ticket properties, from which to choose?\n3. Is there a \"Ticket Summary\" property?\nThank You!!"
