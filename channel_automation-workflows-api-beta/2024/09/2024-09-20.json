    "text": "Hi everyone! I'm having a weird issue trying to create a workflow through the API. I tested the _exact same_ POST request that worked yesterday (changing just the name of the workflow) and this time it failed. My authorization key is working, because I'm able to fetch existing workflows.\n\nThis is the response from <https://api.hubapi.com/automation/v4/flows> (POST):\n```{\n    \"status\": \"error\",\n    \"message\": \"Invalid request to flow creation\",\n    \"correlationId\": \"5bfdce20-ae9e-4155-b318-4122506c5bb2\",\n    \"category\": \"BAD_REQUEST\",\n    \"subCategory\": \"FlowApiStandardFriendlyError.FLOW_CREATION_BAD_REQUEST\"\n}```\nI really appreciate any help or direction :smile:",
