Is there a way to identify the main team of the user that is looking at a CRM Card? It seems to me that simply all teams are listed without discrimination of if it is primary team or not. I was then also looking into checking out the roles in context, but it does not populate any data for me. Roles in this object is referencing the assigned permission set, correct? If so, what could be a reason for no data even though I have the permission set super user?",

A map would probably help with this matching right?"

    "text": "Ah thank you Carter. So much has changed :sweat_smile: this makes it a lot faster to add, but unfortunately it also removes some functionality. The use case was that we show certain properties that still needs input at certain stages of a deal or lead process. That way we reduce visual clutter and make it very simple what needs to be done and what not. This has been a huge plus of the CRM Cards for us, since there is so much info and our reps often felt a little bit lost in what needs to be done at what point. Nudging reps to certain properties that need work at certain stages (but not always) made them super happy.\n\nWhile I like the aesthetics of the new module, it is pretty hard to see that the values can be changed, as it is very white and the little dropdown icon drowns slightly in all the competing visuals. If we could colour some fields if empty and take away some fields conditionally that would be awesome."
