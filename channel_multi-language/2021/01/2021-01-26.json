    "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nNot sure if this is exactly fitting this thread but it’s close.\n\nWe have a client that is an international brand that has 4 different website versions (US, UK, AUS, NZ). We’re building landing pages for them and they want to have a different header menu display based on the geographic location of the web visitor. My main question is: Is this possible/practical/feasible in HubSpot?\n\nI know this goes past the purview of Smart Objects and likely would involve some JS but I’m wondering if anyone has seen this done successfully in the past.\n\nAny assistance is much appreciated!",
