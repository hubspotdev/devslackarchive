I added the HubSpot tracking code in Borlabs, so far so good, but now I want to also Track the LinkedIn Pixel using the HubSpot Integration, but I need a separate Borlabs consent for that. Is there a way using the Tracking Code API to allow a single Tracking Pixel (So not “Marketing” in general, but rather “LinkedIn” only, so I can create a Borlabs Consent for that.\nAny help would be appreciated! Thanks!"
