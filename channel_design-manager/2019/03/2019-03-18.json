The block option for require_css/require_js is actually a HubL tag (<https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-tags#require-css>)(<https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-tags#require-js>) and the inline option for this is a HubL function (<https://designers.HubSpot.com/en/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-functions#require-css>)(<https://designers.HubSpot.com/en/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-functions#require-js>). While they have the same name they function a bit differently. The require_css/require_js HubL tags were hidden from the sidebar menu of the designer docs earlier so I just got them added in there for increased visibility and we're looking to get the two sections (tags + functions) linked so you can easily get from one to the other."
