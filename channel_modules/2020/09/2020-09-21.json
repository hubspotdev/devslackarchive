I have 2 custom modules on the home page. 1 that pulls in a specific category of posts through a loop for 2 different blogs &amp; one that uses custom fields where the client can set specific categories. Both loops were working fine until we launched now every link in both modules takes you to the same/wrong link. The console is showing the correct links though."
