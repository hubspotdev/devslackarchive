I want to set it up so that when I click a button on the custom card in Contacts, it will copy the subject and email body details and paste them into the HubSpot email pop-up. This way, the email will be ready for the user to send. Is this possible?\nThis is what i am referring, what i want is when i click the send email, I want the email pop-up to appear and paste the subject and the body.\n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Share-Your-Work/Button-onclick-to-copy-the-text-and-open-email-pop-up-in/m-p/1000296#M1242>"
