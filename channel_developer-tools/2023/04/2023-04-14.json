    "text": "Hi George Bellota, follow these steps I think this will help you     1. Open a new spreadsheet and create a table with the columns you need for your quote template. You can customize the column headers and formatting as needed.2. Save the spreadsheet as a template file. In Excel, you can do this by clicking \"File\" &gt; \"Save As\" &gt; \"Excel Template\". In Google Sheets, you can do this by clicking \"File\" &gt; \"Make a copy\" and then selecting \"Google Sheets template\" as the file type.3. Use the template to create new quotes by opening the template file and entering the quote details into the appropriate cells. Each quote will have its own independent set of columns that can be edited without affecting other quotes.4. Save each quote as a separate file or use a document management system to organize and track your quotes."
