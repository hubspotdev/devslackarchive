    "text": "Hi friends, support says they are confuddled so asking here because this seems so simple... we want to trigger a workflow to go out 5 days before a date in a deal property. (ie: if the property date is 11/3/24, it would go out today on 10/30/24).... I am using the 'less than X days from now' and it seems to be picking up two days, both 11/3/24 and 11/4/24. Anyone have any thoughts on how this can be accomplished?",
