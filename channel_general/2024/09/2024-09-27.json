We're working on an embedded Tableau dashboard for our HubSpot hosted site (<http://ridecircuit.com|ridecircuit.com>) using Tableau's guidance for how to <https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/connected_apps_eas.htm|Configure Connected Apps with OAuth2.0>. In our use-case, we want to create an app where account management and user permissions are managed by <https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/connected_apps_eas.htm#step-2-register-your-eas-with--tableau-cloud|AuthO, acting as the EAS> for Tableau, and we have registered it with Tableau\n\nHowever, we are receiving <https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/connected_apps_troubleshoot.htm#:~:text=10098,or%20encrypted%20JWT.|a 10098 error from Tableau>, suggesting that our JWT for the embed view is not formatted correctly or we're missing a parameter in the token itself. 2 questions as a result:\n\n1. Any thoughts on specific HubSpot settings that need to be enabled? \n2. Should we be <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/creating-an-app|registering our app in HubSpot, as a public app>, and pointing both Tableau and our IdP  (Auth0) to the public app's respective client info in Hubppot?"
