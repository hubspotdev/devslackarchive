I don't know why I felt like blog modules would work any differently than web modules.\n\nWhat I was forgetting is that I could use the blog objects and properties (e.g. post.name, post.topic_list, etc).\n\nI ended up creating custom modules for the Blog Listing and Blog Post so I could add properties allowing users to modify the UI based on the module properties and styles. This allowed me to use my custom UI css files to build out the layouts and apply colors and such from the theme settings or user-chosen styles."
