This quote template has a background image in it. I went to the html file code to try to locate the image to remove it but was unable to find it. I'm happy to share the code if necessary. The code itself is not directly editable, and I know I can duplicate it as a child. I will say, I don't know how to change what html file is used across quote templates.

CSS and JS. You can work with plain HTML or utilize a JS framework like react, vue or similiar.\nAlso: Even if there's something not documented in the HubSpot dev docs, it _might_ work if it's written/documented in Jinja."
