From what i am seeing, it looks like expected behavior is to get whatever content is currently on the page that you are copying. So if someone has built out a section with a title and 2 text columns, after adding those elements and then updating the copy from the default, whatever the newly updated content that is in that section is, will be what is copied for HubL."
