If your app did not connect/attach HubSpot deal with quickbook invoice, you can not access that invoice of quickbook via HubSpot CRM Accounting Extension api. In simple words, you can not write a script that will run on your local machine to fetch details of some data which was part of CRM Accounting Extenion API. Most invoicing automation is supposed to performed from an external webserver endpoint (hosted by you at some place). If you want to really use CRM Accounting Extension, you need to first grasp the concept of webhook. Once you understand it, the rest should be easy. I think that's all from me on this topic."
