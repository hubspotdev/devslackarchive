All of the other tables appear to have dates except the engagements table which is pulling through a long integer. I tried googling and using GPT but I cant seem to correctly convert the number back into a date. The first screenshot is the list engagements node and the second is search companies to show the difference in dates. Any ideas?",

However if a contact comes into HubSpot as a lead and then they create an account with us, when we try to send an api call to upsert, we get an error saying the unique identifier is a duplicate key (even when there is no record with that key in HubSpot) because there already exists a Contact with that email in HubSpot. Is there any way around this? We essentially want to merge the Lead contact with the contact that is coming from our database without using the email as a key. Thank you! (cc:: <@U069JV26UE7> )"
