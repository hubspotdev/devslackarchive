    "text": "Hey all, I am using the webhook integration to get some entities and store them to our db. One thing that I noticed is that the id number of any entity ie a Company entity is extremely big already currently 9795562993. After playing a bit with creating and deleting  companies I also noticed this number is not incremented by 1 but by many more which makes believe that this table is being used by all the HubSpot users besides the users of my company. Is this true? if yes would it make sense to store the id of any entity as type varchar instead of int or bigint in MySQL? I am just conscious of the size that it would soon reach the limit of any int/bigint type."

    "text": "Does anyone have experience with submitting Custom Behavioral Events via API? I'm on a project where we're integrating HubSpot into an Event Driven Architecture, and we're exploring using CBE's to track non-HubSpot form submits on a website. The reason being that keeping a sync of website forms and corresponding HubSpot forms (to leverage the Form Submit API) may not be desireable.\n\nIn this situation, the middleware flow would roughly be:\n1. Receive event about form submission\n2. Fetch form submission data from website API\n3. Create or update contact in HubSpot using Create Contact API\n4. Create CBE for contact with form data, including session source information\nBut from a HubSpot perspective, if we use CBE's for form submits, I'd want to track session source data. According to CBE API documentation, I am able to submit `hs_touchpoint_source` with one of HubSpot's source values, but then of course I need to know what the source was. Could I instruct the website developer to extract this data from the hutk and make it available for the form submission, so the middleware can retrieve it in the API call, then dynamically populate it in the Send CBE request? I.e. can it be found there?",
