    "text": "Hello everyone. I am having a problem setting up the hello-world example in the CMS React repo. The setup was going fine until I hit the deploy command. When I run deploy it gives me this error in this image. Hs init worked fine and I followed the guide to a T. The only thing I did different was I forked the repo instead of cloning. Does anyone know why this would come up?",
