    "text": "Hello folks,\nSo, I'm facing an issue with HubSpot Nord API. I was trying to pull the specific contact data with `propertyWithHestory` of a specific property. I've referred <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs/blob/master/codegen/crm/contacts/apis/BasicApi.ts|this> document for that. And as per the document order of the query parameters might be this `public async getById(contactId: string, properties?: Array&lt;string&gt;, propertiesWithHistory?: Array&lt;string&gt;, associations?: Array&lt;string&gt;, archived?: boolean, idProperty?: string, _options?: Configuration)` .\n\nBut when I tried to follow this order in my code like this `const ApiResponse = await HubSpotClient.crm.contacts.basicApi.getById(event.object.objectId, [\"phone\", \"email\", \"video_watch_count\"], [\"video_watch_count\"], [\"Deal\"], [\"Deal\"], [\"Deal\"], [\"Deal\"])` it shows me some error. And when I try to decode the error I got the request link in the error message like this `\"href\": \"<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/411751?properties=phone&amp;properties=email&amp;properties=video_watch_count&amp;associations=video_watch_count&amp;paginateAssociations=Deal&amp;archived=Deal&amp;idProperty=Deal>\"`\nWhich is not following the order of parameters as per the document.\n\n_Note: The multiple `[\"Deal\"]`  array is to show the error message properly._\n\nCan anyone please guide me with this?",
