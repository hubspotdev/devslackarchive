    "text": "Hi everyone! We’re thinking about making the switch to HubSpot and currently testing different features…\n\nWe’re curious (and forgive me if this is posted in the wrong channel), what service/integration do you recommend for SMS &amp; calling within the CRM? We’re looking for the most native but customizable approach, where our sales agents can make and receive inbound calls on their own designated numbers, as well as have the ability to send text messages to their contacts from the same phone number directly in the CRM. Would also like to be able to create workflows that send text messages on behalf of our sales agents from their designated phone numbers.\n\nThank! :slightly_smiling_face:",
