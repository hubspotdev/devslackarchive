We currently have a custom form on our website being filled out, and upon submission we call the contacts API to create a new contact in HubSpot.\n\nHowever, the missing piece here is that the \"Original Source\" value will always be set to \"Offline sources\" with this implementation, but we need to be able to see what the referring link was for our marketing activity attribution.\n\nI found some <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/events/tracking-code|documentation> where they attached the cookie value to a contact by calling the 'identify' function (ties email address to cookie), and then another call to 'trackPageView' or 'trackCustomBehavioralEvent' function (pushes this new tie to HubSpot). We've just implemented this solution to no avail, has anyone run into a similar situation or does anyone have some insight into a solution?",
