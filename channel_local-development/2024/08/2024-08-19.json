I'll summarize all the checks here for you so you can make sure you have done those.\n\n1. Get the latest CLI \n2. Install dependencies for extension frontend &amp; serverless\n    a. cd src/app/extensions, npm install \n    b. cd src/app/app.functions, npm install\n    c. If you did npm install for extensions, you may want to start fresh by deleting it all package-lock.json and node_modules\n3. Configure .env inside your app.functions. \nAre you able to run a simple getting started project with local dev?\n\nAlso, which documentation page did you use for the step by step walk through?"
