Honestly, this would be the best because they can screenshare/walk through it while they have you on the call. I believe this should be within what they can help with (sometimes more coder-heavy stuff they can't help with as they aren't coders, but this isn't really code focused)"

But once the blog is published, HubSpot removes the punctuation leading to differing urls."

    "text": "Hi <@UDARG2NKZ>, appreciate your recommendation but seems that using global custom module will not work on what we are expecting since it prevents the content editor from editing the module. My actual goal was to insert a smart rich text module in a custom module. Iâ€™ve tried adding a rich text widget block from it but its not working. Is there other work around for it? As per checking the net for a solution, seems that we dont have other option. Also the given link above is still in planning, but hopefully its already in development and have a target date for release."
