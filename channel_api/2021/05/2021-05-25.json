    "text": "Hi <@U01RU55DN1H>\nNot that I'm aware of. You'll have to do something like:\n[1] Use Search CRM to look for the Deal in question. If the search returns a result, update the Deal using the returned ID. If no results are returned, create the Deal.\n[2] Use the relatively new external record ID feature (search for the heading \"Creating your own unique identifiers\" in this article: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/understanding-the-crm>). Here you could first try to create the Deal -- if the Deal already exists in your HubSpot portal (based on your preconfigured external ID property), you'll likely get a useful failure message which you could then use as a condition to update the existing record.\nHope that helps :slightly_smiling_face:"

    "text": "Hi <@U01UVP5EYE9>\nThere's a hidden HubSpot default Contact property that might be of help. Its internal name is \"hs_calculated_merged_vids\". Here's an example of what is stored within this property if the Contact record has been merged:\n\"hs_calculated_merged_vids\": \"12345:1609857676448;98765:1609857700448\"\nWhere 12345 and 98765 are example contact IDs. The other returned numbers are timestamps representing when the given contact record was merged.\nIf this field is blank, I think you could assume the given Contact record has not been merged.\nAn example GET Contact request URL might look something like:\n[1] <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/{{CONTACT_ID}}?properties=email,hs_calculated_merged_vids&amp;hapikey={{YOUR_HAPIKEY}}>\n\nor, if you'd like to get contact by email:\n\n[2] <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/example@test.com?idProperty=email&amp;properties=hs_calculated_merged_vids&amp;hapikey={{YOUR_HAPIKEY}}>"
