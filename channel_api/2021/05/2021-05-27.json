    "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIn the HubSpot workflow email template, I need to add a link that will be unique for each recipient's contacts. And also it contains some unique contact fields in encryption format so that later on I can make an API call for Contact by decrypting the query parameter.\ne.g. Link format -  <https://www.mydomain.com/encryption_of({contact.some_unique_property})>\n\nFor that first, I have checked with Contact ID and email. In that, I can get the unique link but the link is exposing the sensitive information [_*Not a useful idea*_]\nFor ID,  it will look like this -  <https://www.mydomain.com/101> OR <https://www.mydomain.com/151>\nFor Email,  it will look like this -  <https://www.mydomain.com/abc@test.com> OR <https://www.mydomain.com/xyz@mydomain.com>\n\nAnother way I am thinking to find and use any contact property that is unique (_except Contact-Id, Contact-Email_) and it might contain *GUID* format or anything else. Also, that will be fine if that property is hidden. So that it can be used and pass using a query parameter. It will be unique and it doesn't contain any sensitive information.\ne.g.  <https://www.mydomain.com/16BC18A1-662C-4EF9-AECB-8CD32EDE90D2> OR  <https://www.mydomain.com/DB25CAFE-D619-427B-93B2-07C81DCBE7FE>\n\n1. Do we have such inbuilt contact property available (GUID type unique)? [_*I could not able to find anything*_]\n2. Is there any way to Encrypt the contact property and use it in an email template? [_*Contact insert/add process is \"manual\" and not using API. If we can use the API to save the contact then this whole requirement is easily doable. But I don't need to use the API to Add contact and handle this case*_]\n3. Do we manage the requirement with any other approach?\nLet me know if anyone needs any additional details.",
