    "text": "The core problem here is that we create all these behind-the-scenes lists when we create a flow, and the lists system has (reasonably) put a rate limit on how fast lists can be created, since that is an expensive operation. But, back a couple months ago we did make the limit per-app-portal and raised it significantly, so it _should_ be a lot harder to hit — I’ll make sure that actually took effect, though.\n\nWe are in-progress on a more foundational change to eliminate the list creations when the flow is created (and instead create the lists as-needed when the flows are enabled) but the timeline on that is pretty far out, and not immediately useful to you."
