    "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have a question about the app events payloads (install/uninstall).\n\nDocs page: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/api/app-management/oauth-tokens#delete-a-refresh-token>\n\nIn this documentation page it says that I can delete a refresh token once the app is uninstalled. But how do I get that uninstall event payload in my backend? I tried to check if the payload for app event is triggering the webhook set for the app, but I can’t find any object that represents the app with it’s events to subscribe to. Also I checked if the payload is sent by default (without a subscription) but it looks like they are not.\n\nAny ideas how can I receive the uninstall event payload?",
