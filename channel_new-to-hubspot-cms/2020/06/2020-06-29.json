    "text": "Hi all, need some help advice? i have a client based in india - who are looking to build a real estate website - with dynamic content workflows, etc, however they also require payment gateway integration - with a user and admin dashboard. Payment gateway will not be stripe or paypal, but another entity. So the question i have is can HubSpot CRM be used to do this, or should a secondary development be used i.e. Wordpress for the / admin for user dashboard / reports  side - as then we can do automations based on their payments. - any thoughts / advice?"
