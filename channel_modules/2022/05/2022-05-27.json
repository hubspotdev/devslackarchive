I have an idea of what how I want to do it, but want to ask here before I do anything!!! I have the form js below and would embed it into the landing page which would be different. Or would it make more sense to do a work flow?\n```&lt;script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//js.hsforms.net/forms/v2.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  hbspt.forms.create({\n    region: \"na1\",\n    portalId: \"6327170\",\n    formId: \"2cafd824-9b21-45a2-aab0-5e33a8f391b9\",\n    onFormSubmit: function($form) {\n$('input[name=\"partner_company_name\"]').val('').change();\n}\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;```",
