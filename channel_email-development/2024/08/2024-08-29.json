    "text": "Hi Community,\n\nI hope you are doing well.\n\nI have a specific case in mind and I am wondering if it can be done with a programmable email module.\n\nI need to set up a workflow to send an email to a parent containing information about one of his children. e.g. \" Hi {{parent name}}, we want to tell you XYZ about your child {{chlid's name}}...\"\n\nThe problem I face is, if I enroll the parent's contact in my workflow, it would only allow me to include parents token, and if I enroll the child then the problem is the same in an opposite way.-\n\nI have a same-object association label Parent&lt;&gt;Child set up on the contact object. So I can see how I can use the crm_associations function to get the information of the other contact in the email, but the problem I face is a parent can have multiple children associated with and I need to make sure we don't get the wrong child information in the email. The best way would be if the programmable email module could be informed of the exact record ids of the parent and the child.\n\nSo, my question is : Is there a way to pass context from the workflow to the programmable email? The workflow can get me the ids of the parent and the child, but I don't know how to pass them to the programmable email module.\n\nIf you have any other ideas on how I can achieve this, that would be nice.\n\nThanks in advance!"

I can't figure out how to do this, we are currently on the HubSpot pro tier.\n\nThanks, I tried to figure out how to do this but was unable to.",
