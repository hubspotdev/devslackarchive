    "text": "the forms submit directly to HubSpot and do not submit to your wordpress install(unless you’re using standard wordpress forms with the leadIn plugin).\n\n if you’re using the embed code there is very minimal risk of any significant security issues. The data is not submitted TO the wordpress site in that case, it is submitted directly to HubSpot.\n\nThe only potential security problem I can think of is if someone hacked HubSpot, and changed the script at the url the embed code uses. If that were to happen then that executed javascript could render anything to the page that the embed code was on. That however is very unlikely as they take security very seriously, that code is CDN’d meaning a change to it would likely roll out over time. HubSpot also likely has unit tests in their build environment that would fail because the tests are expecting certain things to be in there and working.\n\nThe only other thing is if someone were to try to paste malicious code into an input field. even then no one uses eval() anymore and HubSpot has plenty of sophisticated stuff going on in the back end, I don’t think an attacker could do anything more than add nonsense contact records, that HubSpot could then flag as spam and cleanse from the database anyways."
