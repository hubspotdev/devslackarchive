    "text": "Hey everyone! I started using HubSpot, and currently watching the course \"HubSpot CMS for Developers\".\nI have been doing everything the instructor was doing and everything was going fine until I finished for that day. Today when I returned to it I started having problem with the terminal.  Basically I am trying to create the template from the command line in vsCode with the command hs create template template-name like the instructor is doing, but I am getting error: zsh: command not found: hs\n\nAnyone solved this problem, or knows how to help? Would be grateful!"
