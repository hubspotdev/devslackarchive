After investigating, we have seen HubSpot avails the option of integrate all the tools except Outbrain. After talking with Jacob, one of your colleages, he told me we can integrate Outbrain campaign data into HubSpot via API with developers help.\n\nCould someone pls confirm if this can be done or maybe of someone have experience integrating Outbrain that way? Or maybe you gius know a better way to send this data\n\nThank you in advance! :pray:"
