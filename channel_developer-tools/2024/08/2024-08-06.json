    "text": "Hello everybody! Looking to gain some insight into prod/dev/staging using HubSpot CMS. I’ve read through the docs but cant seem to find what I’m looking for, so giving the Slack a shot. Apologies if this has been answered before.\n\nI have a client who has a live website, built as a custom theme in HubSpot CMS. This fall they want to scrap everything and start fresh.\n\nIs there any way of creating a stage version with a new theme (and separate content), while the old theme (with old content) is still running, and then “flip the swith” to replace the old with the new?\n\nUsually (like in WP, Contentful or similar) I would set up a completely separate stage on a subdomain. I would be pushing code to it, and the client would work on all the content. Then, when its finished, I would replace the old with the new.\n\nFrom what I’ve read this might not be possible to do with HubSpot CMS, but I might have missed something.\n\nHow do you handle these things? Any help would be appreciated.",
