A few questions:\n• To manage non-essential cookies via our 3rd-party tool, we need to enable HubSpot cookie tracking. Does this activate the HubSpot cookie banner? (We’d like to avoid this since a CMP is already implemented.)\n• How can we stop non-essential cookies (analytics, performance, functional, advertising) from triggering pre-consent?\n    ◦ These cookies can not be edited through the CMP \nThanks in advance for your guidance! :star:"
