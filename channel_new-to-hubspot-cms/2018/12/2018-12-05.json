    "text": "Howdy folks! I’m in marketing for a fintech company in Northern California. I didn’t know a thing about coding a year ago and accidentally fell in love with it while trying to make our templates better.\n\nWe started with HubSpot a couple months ago, and I’ve been trying to figure something out. What exactly is a Module Group on the backend? I’ve treated it like a div that I can make into a container, but sometimes it doesn’t act like a div ought to, which can be frustrating. Any insight here?",

    "text": "Hey Justin! In the design manager, you can clone any module or template to HTML/HubL to see exactly what the visual editor is outputting. In general grouping modules does put them in a wrapping div, but as you say, it doesn't always work the way you might expect. From my experience though, that's usually more to do with modules you're grouping than the grouping action itself. if you have any specific use-case questions, feel free to throw them my way, and welcome to the community :slightly_smiling_face:"
