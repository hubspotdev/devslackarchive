I don't think the built in cookies would be enough.. Especially if they open the link in another device. so I was wondering if we can do something more with API's or else",

The \"Secure JavaScript Libraries\" check specifically uses <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/vulnerabilities|this> Lighthouse audit. \n• For HubSpot-hosted websites, you can disable jQuery by going to Settings &gt;&gt; Website &gt;&gt; Pages &gt;&gt; Templates, and scrolling to the bottom of the page. I believe we now also automatically turn off jQuery for all newly created portals. \n• I agree we should do a better job of highlighting _why_ the audit failed. We are working on some additional documentation and resources that we will link to from the tool to help with that. For the time being, running a Lighthouse scan against the site will give you the necessary info. "
