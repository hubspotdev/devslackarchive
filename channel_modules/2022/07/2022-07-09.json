Can format but this is just perfect #}\nlast newsletter sent: {{contact.newsletter_lastsent }} &lt;br&gt; {# outputs '1-6-22' (d-M-yy) #}```\nFirst date is retrieved from the blog article, no issues with that.\nSecond is from a contact property with ‘datepicker’ format.\n\nI tried to use filters like |strtotime(“d-M-yy”) |unixtimestamp, that just stops the output all-together.\nAny thoughts would be appriciated!!!",
