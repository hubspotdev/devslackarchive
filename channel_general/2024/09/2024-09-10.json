Currently,  I’m an independent growth consultant with Inturact, a data-science backed growth agency for founder-led B2B SaaS.  \n\nI’m a HubSpot power user and have a question on campaign-level reporting. Campaign in this instance would include all the assets for single channel direct response campaigns like paid ads as well as multi-channel/multi-touch campaigns like lead nurture on email + retargeting + any other relevant channel. I want to be able to report MQLs (ie hand-raisers or automation scored leads), SQLs (booked calls with MQLs), pipeline, and ARR on a campaign-level broken down by channels (with UTMs), showing the last-touch channel prior to conversion of that lead into an MQL.  \n\nMy question:  How feasible is it to build this reporting in HubSpot?  \n\nThanks!
