    "text": "Hi All - Looking for advice on how to best approach a problem.  Building a website with a 'Product Catalog' feature for about 15 products.   Each product will have it's own website page.  I'm developing a template for the page.  On the product page the product features are listed in a table.   Two questions:  1)  What is the best way to add the table data onto each page without having to type out all the table row data such as 'product weight'?  (i.e.  copy and paste)    2)  How can I 'templateize' the table so that if I update the width of the table, it will be updated across all 15 product pages?     Any tips would be greatly appreciated.  ps. The client does not have CMS has part of their subscription.",

It’s a huge issue with users getting confused as to why they can’t log-in after they click on the wrong link because HubSpot sends 2 log-in related emails, one to register the email with a password, and then a confirmation email. It’s an absolutely nightmare and my analytics tell a story of users keep clicking on the registration link looking for ways to login to see the private content, and eventually they give up. Too much friction, too many emails for something that should be pretty simple - click a link, save the password, show the content.",
