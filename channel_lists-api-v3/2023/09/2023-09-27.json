This would help to archive legacy properties that are no longer in use.",

    "text": "Hey Louis - thanks for taking a look at the new Lists API.\n\nOur primary focus for the next feature set is giving customers the ability to create, update, and delete lists using this API.\n\nIf I understand your use case correctly, it sounds like what would be useful for you is an API endpoint where you are able to fetch and/or delete lists that meet certain filter criteria. This is an interesting idea and something I will take back to the team as a potential  feature.\n\nWe appreciate the suggestion and look forward to hearing any additional feedback!"
