We (HubSpot) figured that with an older endpoint like this there would be some folks that missed the message (or the deadline) and could use a grace period. We are intentionally still creating events for a few weeks to let you safely migrate without losing data. We plan to shut off the PUT functionality completely in Jan 2025."
