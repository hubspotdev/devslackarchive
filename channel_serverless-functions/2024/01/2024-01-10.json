I changed my node version back to \"16.20.2\".\n\npackage.json has \"type\":\"commonjs\"\n\nwebpack.config.js is based off the demo 'cms-webpack-serverless-boilerplate' and has target:'node' and optimization: {optimize:false}\n\ntsconfig.json uses \"module\":\"commonjs\", \"target\":\"es6\"\n\nThis has now allowed me to use TypeScript for all functions, outputting each individually and HubSpot can read them.\n\nI haven't had time to work out exactly what version of node works, I still have the serverless.json file using \"runtime\":\"nodejs18.x\" too."
