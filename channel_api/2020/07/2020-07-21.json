    "text": "I am not sure who from HubSpot is working on the associations beta... but today I was working on it, and managed to make it crash in a weird way.\n\nIt was not clear, when making an association, if I am expected to make it in one direction or both directions. When I last read the Legacy docs they said I should make it in both directions myself if desired, and the V3 docs do not appear to say one way or the other (which is perhaps a sub-bug).\n\nAnyways, I set up the code to make both directions, without originally realizing that the V3 API appears to create both directions on your behalf now (arguably a net positive, but a behavior change from before which I did not see in the docs).\n\nWhen I did that, I get a really weird HTTP 400 that says \"Cannot build PublicAssociation, some of required attributes are not set [type]\", even though \"type\" is set to a valid association type when you check the relevant association API \"/crm/v3/associations/contact/ticket/types\". It is not clear if some assoc types are broken, or the reverse assoc already existing makes it crash with the wrong message, but it does go away when I comment out my reverse assoc code, so I suspect the message is wrong somehow.\n\nAnother more general feedback point... it seems really weird you have to fill in /crm/v3/associations/FROM/TO/batch/create and TYPE inside the association body. This means the batch endpoint is only letting you make one kind of association at once, and double-specifying different vars which duplicate the same overall logic of what the association should be. I think it would be better to have /crm/v3/associations/batch/create instead, so I could make just one call with every assoc on it for linking my new obj up to the hierarchy, instead of needing, in my case, about 3 calls (on top of the calls to lookup the existing objs, if they exist, to associate onto, in the first place), because this kind of design will make me exceed the 10/sec limit in a hurry. The need to generate the really nested `{ 'from': { 'id': a.from_id }, 'to': { 'id': <http://a.to|a.to>_id }` to set up the assoc is also somewhat weird compared to most APIs in the world, but not the biggest deal.\n\n```2020-07-21 16:09:16,475: web.py: INFO: forward assoc:\n{\n    \"inputs\": [\n        {\n            \"from\": {\n                \"id\": \"10401\"\n            },\n            \"to\": {\n                \"id\": \"164266673\"\n            },\n            \"type\": \"contact_to_ticket\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n2020-07-21 16:09:16,656: web.py: DEBUG: <https://api.hubapi.com:443> \"POST /crm/v3/associations/contact/ticket/batch/create?hapikey=...
