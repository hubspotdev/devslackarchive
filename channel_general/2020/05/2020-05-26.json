    "text": "Hey all,\n\nI am experiencing some interesting performance issues with custom modules and the Drag and Drop page editor.\n\nIn themes I have all dnd sections being defaulted to 80px top and bottom padding. This way content editors dont have to worry about setting them if they dont need to and can just keep plopping in new sections and save some time.\n\nI have a custom module that is meant to be a full width body image or video banner. For the dnd section that it is placed - I override the default 80px padding mentioned before using the styles tab on the page editor.  I also select the  “full width” option for “alignment and spacing”.\n\nShould be good to go. And the final result is as expected.\n\nHowever. I am getting an odd FOUC-like behavior when the page is loading.  Using the performance tab in the dev tools I am able to see that the page first loads with my full width custom module completely constrained and with the original Top and bottom padding of 80px. Then the “page center” constraint is lifted and the module finally comes to be full width.\n\nIt is a little bit of a jarring experience for the end user and I wonder if I have my theme set up incorrectly? or if others are experiencing similar behaviors with themes/custom modules?\n\n_The included image has yellow lines denoting additional top and bottom padding that is added on load (and eventually removed). The purple lines are the page-center constraints that are added and eventually removed._ \n\n_*EDIT:*_ \nNote that if I set the default padding for dnd sections to 0 then it at least stops shifting content vertically when the page loads but it still flashes horizontally.\n```.dnd-section {\n   padding: 0;\n}```",
