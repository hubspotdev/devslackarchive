The content loads when my subdomain DNS CNAME is pointing to HubSpot\n2. It doesn't work when i point my subdomain to my proxy server and then try to forward the request to HubSpot and i get a 403 forbidden.\nWe're using the knowledge base software which doesn't have code injections. the end goal is to just have more control over who sees the content.\n\nany help would be greatly appreciatedÂ :pray:"
