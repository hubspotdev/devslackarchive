    "text": "Hi all, we have a use case where we want to send emails through HubSpot triggered by an ecommerce platform. The Transactional Email Addon with it’s API’s is a great solution for this use case. The problem we have tho, is that for some of the emails, we need to go through a workflow first. I have looked into different solutions for this use case, but what I do not want is having to store the data in a contact property. In that case, we would have to create a new contact property for each order placed or overwrite the previous value of an order.\nWhat would be the best place to store these values (ordernumber, order amount etc.) to access these values in the workflows as well as in the emails? Using deals is not an option here.",
