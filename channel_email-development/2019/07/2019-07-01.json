    "text": "Hey everyone. I’m new to the HubSpot design studio when it comes to creating custom modules and template. I’m about to pull my hair out trying to create a choice field. For the life of me I can’t get it to figure out make the choice display for the user. My project involves a allowing the user to choose how many blocks will be in the email (content block includes header, text, and images). I want the choice field to determine how many of those blocks will be in the email."
