    "text": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI’m facing a challenge and I’m not sure what the best solution is.\n\nFirst, I’m working in *Marketing Enterprise*.\n\nI organize *webinars and physical events (over 100 per year*). For each event/webinar, a specific landing page is created.\n\n*I would like to use just one form for all the landing pages*. Additionally, I want to automatically capture the URL of the page where the form was submitted and store it in a “*LastFormURL*” property for the contact, which I use to *associate contacts with a custom object*.\n\nBoth the landing pages and the forms are hosted on HubSpot.\n\nI’ve tried using *JavaScript* or custom events (custom behavioral events), but sometimes *ad blockers* prevent the JavaScript from running.\n\nI’m a bit stuck and not sure how to approach this problem. Do you have *any ideas or recommendations*?\n\nI checked <https://gist.github.com/robertainslie/32d786d7254ec7bc6cbbff3d1e292cd4> and <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/advanced_form_options>",
