    "text": "Hello all -- hoping for a point in the right direction if possible. I'm looking to pull in HubSpot parameters for all my website visitors. I'd like to write a script that uses a combination of HubSpot data and GA data to set custom GA dimension values. For example:\n\nCustom Dimension is \"In Persona\" and it's a simple yes or no boolean value - I want to be able to easily identify customers who are considered in our persona or not. An example how a person could be \"in persona\" from HubSpot or from google analytics would be like this:\n\n*HubSpot* - main email address ends in \".edu\"\n*google analytics* - search query includes \"higher education\"\n\nSo I want to be able to know as soon as the user session begins that they are in person or not. In addition I also want to create a more complicated logic where based on a variety of behaviors and engagements on the website, we would begin tracking and applying a score to those behaviors and engagements until eventually the user reveals themselves to be in persona or not.\n\nObviously I'm going to need to set values by writing some script but the question I have is how woud you go about pulling in HubSpot parameters? Our website is wordpress.",
