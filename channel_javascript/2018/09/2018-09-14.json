    "text": "Hey all - I was wondering if anybody here knows the source for HubSpot adding the &lt;div id=\"site-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; just after the body tags of my html. I hardcoded a new page for a client to work around the auto-bootstrap and it is messing with their default mobile menu. HubSpot seems to be generating the #site-wrapper tag twice and is causing the body to be pushed out twice as far when the mobile menu opens up.\n\nI assume HubSpot is injecting this via some scripting but I am not certain - any thoughts would be appreciated!",
