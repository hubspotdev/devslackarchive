Currently it seems that it is only possible using the ‘+’ (‘insert-new-section-button’), wich does not appear when the dnd_area is empty. So in order to add a section you have to add a module to that area (and remove it after adding a section).\nOr is this sth. wich can be enabled by configuration (didn’t come across sth. on that one yet)?"
