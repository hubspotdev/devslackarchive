    "text": "Hi everyone, for my company's website I'm using the HubSpot CMS native section styling options (alignment and spacing, background). A couple of weeks ago, I noticed that sections which previously had a background color set via the section styling and a background image set with custom css in the page code, are not displaying the background color anymore.  I investigated a bit in the browser dev tools and found that the css code is different, without any updates done to the page so that now the background color is output as background-image: linear-gradient instead of background-color, which is a bit counterintuitive.\n\nDoes anyone know if this is something that's here to stay? Is there any CMS release notes I can check to make sure things don't break with updates?",
