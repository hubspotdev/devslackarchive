For example, if your account does not have access to HubDB, your private app will not have access to the HubDB scope.\n\nPrivate app access tokens will be updated to reflect available scopes in your HubSpot account and what you configured for the private app, but the token string itself will not change.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs why I wanted to see if it could be transferred to another user but at that point creating a new private app seems like less work.\n"
