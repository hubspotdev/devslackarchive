When I try to connect over “hs init”, I get a “The post in account XXX was forbidden”. I can not really enroll into the beta as it seems as I’m having a Pro Account and not Enterprise. But here I could be wrong. When I try to “init” the App to the Dev Account I will get that the “Personal CMS Access Key” doesnt exist.\nCan anyone give me a hint how I can set up a Custom Card in this environment? :)",
