Does it work the same here per-request? or per-resolver?\n\nPromise I’m not planning on doing either :sweat_smile:  just want to make sure we know and play nice!",

    "text": "Hey David - great question. Rate limiting works a little differently for GraphQL. We use a query complexity score to calculate limits, that exist on a per request basis, and a rolling minute basis. There is more details in <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/query-HubSpot-data-using-graphql#query-complexity-and-account-limits>. These limits are new, so we are interested in feedback on them!"
