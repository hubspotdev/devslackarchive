I put the module on the landing page and I layout it like a recent blog post, And when I'm creating a new blog post, the new blog is updating on the blog itself, but it's not updating on my module I made same as the code of the blog. But on the developer's preview it's updating, but on the landing page it's not updating. What could be the reason for that?"
