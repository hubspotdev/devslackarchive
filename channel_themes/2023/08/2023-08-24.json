So <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes/custom-fonts#:~:text=you%2C%20and%20the-,fonts.json,-file%20will%20need|this reference> seems to be incorrect. Or I could be misunderstanding something about how HubSpot detects .json files in the fonts folder.",

Within each of those font-specific folders, you’ll place the webfont files and a `font.json` containing the data defining the font and how the editor should use it."
