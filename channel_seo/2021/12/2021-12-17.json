    "text": "Michael’s right- sounds like your blog listing template needs an H1. You can add H1s to all of these different pages in that template using the blog HubL logic - `{% if is_listing_view %}`, `{% if blog_author %}` , `{% if tag %}` (checks if you’re on a tag page), etc. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/templates/blog#if-is-listing-view-statement|This doc> might help!"
