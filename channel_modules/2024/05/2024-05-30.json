    "text": "Hi,\n\nWe, as a HubSpot customer, are experiencing an issue with styling. The reason why I post here, is because I was asked by the HubSpot technical support to address this topic here, thus - it's not a support request but rather trouble-shooting or something in between.\n\n*Background*\nWe're using the Act3 theme, bought in HubSpot Marketplace for both our website and blogs. Theme is developed by Neambo.\n\n*The issue*\nWhen we mark text as bold with a \"B\" in for example a \"Rich text\" module *on the website*, the text get `<strong>` formatting. But, doing the same *in our blog*, the formatting gets the `<bold>` formatting - but it shouldn't. It should be strong.\n\nThe difference when tying Test of text, marking text and press \"B\" for bold on:\n\nWebsite: `<p>Test of <strong>text</strong>.</p>`\nBlog: `<p>Test of <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">text</span>.</p>`\n\nFor SEO purposes, `<strong>` is better than `<bold>` and thus, that would be better. That should if I'm not mistaken, be the default styling/formatting for everything \"bold\", but that might be something not everyone agree on.\n\n*In limbo as customer/user*\nNeambo says:\n\n\"Hi Sean,\n\nThat looks like an inconsistency in HubSpot. It seems that using the B button in a sidebar Rich Text field (the one I tested) creates a <strong> tag, while using it in an inline Rich Text field, like the blog content field, creates a <span> tag with an inline style for bold font :slightly_frowning_face:.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't fix this from our end. It's not a theme thing. It's a HubSpot system tool, so only HubSpot can control it\"\n\n*Testing please?*\nIs there anyway someone can test this, maybe with HubSpots default modules as well as with one or several themes to see if there's actually a theme-related issue or something else? As an end user/customer, I'd not like to go into the source code every time we need to bold something in blog texts.\n\nHelp. :smile:\n\nPS/EDIT: If this is a sub-optimal or even wrong Slack channel, please direct me to the right one.",

Extra complicated as putting it in a data attribute means it comes into JavaScript as a string, so now we have a string to convert to an object to convert to json. Sounds like it should be a super simple thing to do so I was sure I must be missing something."

I want to escape the single quote character in a url field so that it doesn't end the data attribute, so I'm using escapejs and escape_json together but now I have a bunch of \\\\x27 in my output and idk how to convert those back to useful characters lol."

Been directed here by HubSpot support!\n\n‚Ä¢ My hero video module is adding in \"ghost padding\" of 30px above even when the padding is set to 0, the attached screenshot below is a previous fix we had inputted into the back end to fix it but the problem has returned\n‚Ä¢ Image modules often reject images - the image loads in and is uploaded cleanly but it doesnt display, it just displays a blank box. A bit stuck with this one as I have tried multiple images and sometimes it self rights itself after a few days but this obviously is a bit of a worry when building new pages and also if it should happen in the live environment\nWould be great to open a dialogue with someone on any ideas you have - am new to this slack community so sorry if I have put this forward in the wrong place.",
