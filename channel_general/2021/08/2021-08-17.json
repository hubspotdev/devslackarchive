We have created a sandbox account alongside a clients 'production' HubSpot account as a sort of test environment, firstly, is this the correct way to use a sandbox?\n\nIn essence, we are looking to use the sandbox as a direct copy of the production account to be able to test certain integrations without affecting the ongoing business. Additionally, is there anything we need to do to sync up the production environment with the sandbox environment?",
