Looks at the elements that render on a page, looks through and parses the styles associated with those elements, then returns the font families and weights actually being used, just in a list. Ideal use case is like if a page is loading all possible font weights and variants for like three or four fonts, but only actually uses 3 styles. I'd just want a list of Raleway: 400, 600, Open Sans 700."
