    "text": "Hello,\nI'm using the HubSpot Associations API in my custom code to retrieve the custom association type between a \"Deal\" object and a \"Contact\" object, for example \"occupant\", \"owner\" etc. However, I'm facing an issue where instead of returning the custom association type name, the API is simply returning \"deal to contact\".\nI believe this is because the API is not recognizing the custom association type that I have created. Can you please help me resolve this issue and retrieve the custom association type correctly?\n```      // Recherche contacts\n      // solution 1: ne retourne pas les types d'association\n      \n      HubSpot.crm.objects.associationsApi.getAll(toDeal, dealId, [\"contacts\"]).then(results =&gt; {\n          let associations = results.results;\n          let contact_ids = associations.map(a =&gt; a.id);\n          console.log('associations: ',associations, contact_ids);\n          contact_ids.forEach(function (entry) {\n            console.log(entry);\n          })\n      })```\n       Thank you",

Team 2 works Wed - Sunday\nI was thinking that I could create a workflow that assigns a lead to a user through an if/then actions where:\n1. if day of week = Mon or Tues then assign to Team 1\n2. if day of week = Wed, Thurs or Fri then assign to either Team 1 or 2\n3. if day of week = Sat or Sunday then assign to Team 2\nMy conundrum is how to get the day of week. If there is a solution already available then I am all ears.\n\nThanks",
