    "text": "Thank you for confirming this. Really wish this were more clearly spelled out in the product UI / docs.\n\nThe reason CBEs are so nice is because they can be fed through Segment. We are migrating from Intercom and you can trigger a Series (Intercom equiv of Workflows) or a transactional email when an individual event fires. So our backend has been built up to fire a ton of rich events that we can use to automate emails around.\n\nIt appears to get the equivalent behavior for Workflows I need to:\n\n• Send CBEs to trigger the Workflow, but _only_ if I am confident the equivalent Contact property got saved first. This puts a lot of pressure on timing, and since Segment is async that is hard to ensure.\n• Or... as you suggested, ditch Segment entirely for \"events\" and move to custom objects.\nAnd then for transactional emails, it looks like I just have to drop down to HubSpot's transactional email API, which is totally detached from CBEs, which is a real shame."
