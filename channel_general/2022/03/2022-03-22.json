Instead, you'll likely want to use a third-party or completely custom HTML form to handle the user input, send the data to your API (and any necessary data manipulation as well to ensure the API accepts the data) and then either use AJAX or a timeout function to direct the user to the next page."

So what I’m trying to find out information on is what ability is there to migrate over CMS data. Is it possible to migrate over specific data - ie existing populated website pages and landing pages etc or an we clone an entire instance like-for-like and remove what we don’t want. Since we’re in the middle the new build we really need some answers before we go too far down one path and could potentially need to re-do everything. Would really appreciate some insight if anyone has experienced anything similar. Thanks",
