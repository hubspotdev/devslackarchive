The marketing emails are setup in the production portal and the transactional emails are build in the dev portal, using custom code and custom modules. I need a few of the saved sections of a drag an drop email to create the right look and to test how they behave with custom tokens  send with the transactional email API. Guess I'll have to recreate those. \nBut thank you for taking your time to respond."
