    "text": "Hi everyone, I am new to HubSpot CMS and trying to get one of our website builds into the HubSpot cms so that there will be drag and drop modules the client can use to edit/update the site in the future. I have already setup the HubSpot/CLI locally and used the cms-react-boilerplate. Our project is built using Next.js, my question however, whether it is possible to build multiple modules within this boilerplate, the HubSpot modules corresponding to my react components/module? So that I basically can translate all my locally built react components into modules on HubSpot?",
