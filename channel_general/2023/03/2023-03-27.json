Upon form submission I want to redirect the user to an arbitrary url and pass along the data that was submitted in the form along with the utm info. What is the recommended way to accomplish this?\n\nI've begun to go down a path of customizing the embed script to call `onFormSubmitted` and manually building up the payload and redirecting the user, but it feels a bit hack-y.",
