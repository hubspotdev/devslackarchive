However, there are other alternatives.\n\nPlease ping me to discuss the details."

    "text": "Hey guys! Quick question. So can create dynamic pages via HubL functions (crm_objects, etc), HubDB, and GraphQL. For our use case, we have determined that we will be pulling data directly from the objects. I am playing around with the HubL functions approach, but I'm curious about the GraphQL one as well. So my question is, when would I use one over the other, and what are the pros and cons of each approach from you guys' experience?"
