    "text": "Can see a lot of possibilities with the new Serverless functions. However, I wonder if it’d be more accessible/useful if they could be used directly in the CRM. An example would be in Workflows - adding a “serverless” action might be quite nice. Then somewhere in the interface to manage these serverless functions. Could also be triggered for transform/load processes when contacts are added. I like the idea of being able to select which function to use for an event - much like how AWS has included Lambada actions in most of it’s services.\n\nRegardless, I think it would be useful to add a reference to Serverless functions in the documentation here: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/workflows/choose-your-workflow-actions#trigger-a-webhook> / <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/Workflows/How-do-I-use-webhooks-with-HubSpot-Workflows>",
