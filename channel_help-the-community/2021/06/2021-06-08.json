Sorry for the slow response I had to do a lot of digging and asking around.\n\nI think you would need to add columns to the left and right of the module to  create the margins you want for now or use a custom module - with fields to control the left and right margin.\n\nThe tooltip appears to be misleading.\n\nRegardless we’re working on some things to make it easier to control the styling of modules in the page editor."
