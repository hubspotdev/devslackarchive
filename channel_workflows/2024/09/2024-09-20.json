    "text": "Hello guys,\nI have an application that creates a task for a specific salesperson when no one is online. When this task is created, I need to send a notification to that specific person. Through the API, I can only send a reminder when the task is expired.\nI tried creating a workflow, but it is based on a contact, and in the workflow, I could only assign it to a fixed person. I would like to send it dynamically to the specific salesperson. How can I achieve this? Thanks!",
