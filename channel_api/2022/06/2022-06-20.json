This app is only used by them and they want us to connect it with their HubSpot instance to launch SMS within a workflow. They don't have Operations Hub Pro so they can't use custom code. The option I had thought of was to create a private application, the problem is that from the workflow section I can only access public applications. Is it possible to create a public application that can only be used by this client so that it is visible from Workflow? In case you can't or shouldn't, do you know any alternative to connect this SMS sending application without hiring Operations HubPro? Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:",
