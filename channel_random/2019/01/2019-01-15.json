    "text": "working on an html email for an insurance company, and it lists a bunch of specialties for doctors. I’ve come to the conclusion that medical specialties are not named at all in a lay-man friendly way whatsoever. I mean what is an otolarangologist.\n\nI feel like in web dev we’re a bit better with our specialty names - Front end Web Developer, Search Engine Optimizer, Database Administrator, UI/UX Specialist, Web Designer, Accessibility Specialist. We only start to get real confusing to people when we start calling ourselves, react developers, or Vue developers.\n\nIf  I had any say, we’d call em butt doctors, colon doctors, brain doctors. heart doctors, Cancer specialists, pregnancy specialist, I mean we have  Ear nose n throat doctors. we can use the terms surgeon and whatnot. it’s just the crazy science terms that seems problematic.\n/rant"
