I wasn't able to find anything on my own, so you guys are my last hope..\nI'm developing an application for a single company-user with a primary action. a problem that I'm facing - that all the data comes via the body but not with parameters to my endpoint.

I solved my problem by doing the following:\n1. rewrote the custom code in python cause i find it simpler to use the requests library over dealing with promises in node\n2. used the v4 List associations endpoint to get back all associated deals for a given contact (the limit of 1000 items before pagination made the pagination issue moot)\n3. used the v3 Read batch deals endpoint to get the details I needed for the associated deals in order to accomplish my task since there isn’t a v4 version of the deals api listed in the docs yet. I didn’t run into any pagination issues, and while the max items isn’t listed in the docs, it accomplishes what I need.\nI do hope that in v4 of the docs, it is more clear how to use the after param in requests, especially with the clients. It took a lot of guesswork on my part, especially when I wasn’t getting back the expected data in v3."

The HubSpot form feeds the CRM system of HubSpot.\n\nI receive after submitting the form a mail in which the new properties are displayed. One of these properties is \"Address your contact\" (mandatory field).\nIn 25% of the submissions I receive via this form, this property is listed and named in the mail (for example \"product/technologies\"), but it is not listed in the CRM system. So this property is not assigned to the customer in HubSpot. However, because I use this property in a workflow, I absolutely need it.\nThe mail I receive is from HubSpot. So I conclude that HubSpot has this information available.\n\nI don't recognize any scheme when it is transferred to the crm-sytem and when it is not....
