    "text": "Hello, everyone! I was wondering if there are any automation/workflow experts in South Africa in this channel? I know of a really exciting, Durban-based fintech company that are looking for someone to head up the automation side of their HubSpot implementation. The role would be on a contract basis and experience in eCommerce would be advantageous. DM me if interested or you know of someone that would fit the role. Thanks! :raised_hands:"
