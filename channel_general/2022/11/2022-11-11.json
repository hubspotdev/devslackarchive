What I established is that there is actually just a line item property called `hs_position_on_quote` which can be used to sort line item order to reflect the UI.\n\nThe other answer to my original Q is that essentially HubSpot will fill the line items with the contents of the most recent quote (regardless of the status of that quote e.g. approved/archived etc). Since I asked the question, the quotes API has been launched though so that solves for that use case."
