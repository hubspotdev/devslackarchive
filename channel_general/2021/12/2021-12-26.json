    "text": "I'm almost certain this wasn't the case 2 weeks ago, as I had tested something then, but... It seems we can't use global theme settings values outside of CSS files... Referencing one in a template, or a module, only returns the default value of the global theme setting field, not the \"actual\" value (i.e. if a user changes a setting). I'm pretty sure this is a bug or not working as intended, or at least I'm hopeful that's the case, but it probably won't be fixed for a while..... If anyone has any ideas for a way around this somehow, please let me know, I've gone through pretty much every workaround I could think of, to no avail.",
