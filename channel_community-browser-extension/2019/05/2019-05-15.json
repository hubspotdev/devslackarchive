This tab displays the developer info for the current page. The key value pairs are clickable. Clicking a key will copy to your clipboard the HubL to get that specific data. Clicking the value will copy just the value.\n\nHuge huge thanks to <@U7ADCU3BM>, he did 99% of the css and JS for formatting the JSON and generating the HubL, <@U6GNQ7JBU> <@U6W3H6YN8> consulted on js to get the developer info in a secure way.(no data is stored in the extension at all, no data leaves the extension to make the dev info feature work, a user can only view developer info if they have permission through the sprocket button normally). This feature is expected to break due to an API change, so enjoy it while it lasts, I hope to upgrade the feature to make it continue working but likely have to rely on collaboration with HubSpot in order to do so.",
