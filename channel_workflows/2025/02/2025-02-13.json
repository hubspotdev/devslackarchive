It will be hard to find where they were in a workflow that is already heavily branched with delays - where to put them again.\n\nI did hear back from HubSpot support and they said this is the expected behaviour - we just did not have this previously before the way that merging contacts changed. When one merged to the other, it retained placement in workflows. now it merges to a new object ID that place in multiple workflows is lost."

Itâ€™s definitely a shift from how things worked before. I've also encountered this issue multiple times before but to ensure the process is controlled I suggest controlling contact merging proactively based on the team roles since it is the best approach to avoid disruptions, particularly when integrations are involved.\n\nHave you considered setting up specific rules or guidelines for when and how contacts should be merged to minimise workflow impact? Is it happening very often that you have to merge contacts?"

    "text": "I think you're right... thats problem all we can do at this point to retain workflow placement.\n\nWe have a surprising amount of contacts that need merging because they will email form a secondary email not initially on file. These contacts are not necessarily noticed straight away if emailing outside of HubSpot too...\nFor now, we are manually re-associating the activity to the 'right' contact and moving the email over to a secondary email file, then deleting the duplicate contact. We get around 400 a month so it's quite a task in itself to go through those.\n\nIf we create some merging 'rules' to use internally, that may help things."
