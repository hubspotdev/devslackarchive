No more hacky workarounds needed. I dont think that there are many folks using webpack currently with HubSpot but if there are feel free to install and play! Seems to be working with all of my tests. Would love to have some folks test drive it too!\n\n<https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spingroup/postcss-hubl>"

If I'm understanding this correctly you can write/edit code and create new modules/templates, etc using both watch and upload but you can't remove files/modules, templates, etc?

    "text": "Ahhh well - it kind of depends on how you work tbh. I am in and out of a lot of portals each day over a few different accounts. All of the sites I touch typically range from the old Drag and Drop templates to the new DND themes. It’s a bit inefficient for me to have dev accounts for all of them and what not. So I typically just use the production portals and create test pages and work off of those.\n\nThat way I can always just run a watch command and bang away on what I need. It’s pretty darn fast and agile once you get moving with it. And very safe if you do it correctly. You just have to kind of know what youre working on and how to work on it in production so that it doesnt affect live things, etc.\n\nIf youre working on a single portal or fewer portals it might be more beneficial to setup a git flow and work off of that using git deploys."
