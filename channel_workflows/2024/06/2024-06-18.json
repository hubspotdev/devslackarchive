Too many API calls causing your custom code to rate limit.\n3. Your code timed out.\nWithout seeing your code it's a little tough to say why this is happening exactly though"

But usually first time it tries it's &gt; 20 seconds, it breaks, second time are less requests and it goes good.\nBut main problem is that I checked, and code block wasn't making any API requests. It seems that it was stuck in some kind of loop.\nAfter I turned workflow OFF, then ON -&gt; it started working normally again.\nSo, I'm 99% it was a problem somewhere on HubSpot side, where they are running code blocks"
