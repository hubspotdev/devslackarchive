    "text": "We have a client that needs to merge 2 portals - they had one for Sales and one for Marketing.   Neither sides want to be the one to “export into the other” for fear of losing data. Exporting marketing side may lose analytics. Exporting contacts from sales side may lose contact history.  Does anyone have a recommendation as to which way is best?  Ideally, if HubSpot could merge the accounts that’d be great, but HS support said there’s nothing they could do."
