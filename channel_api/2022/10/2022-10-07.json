This can routinely result in tens of thousands of webhook events from Attentive within a very short time frame, so I need a way to capture those webhook events and then process them without hitting HubSpot’s API rate limits.\n\nMy first attempt that has run into rate limit issues was: AWS API Gateway → AWS Lambda Function. Each function invocation needed to hit the Search API and then update the matching contact record(s).",

The v3 api version doesn’t seem to have the opt-in information, only if they are subscribed or not, which isn’t all the data. If GDPR is not enabled, then contacts don’t need to explicitly opt-in to a subscription and show as “subscribed” even if not opted-in. We need to know the difference, where do we get the opt-in data for a contact using the api?",
