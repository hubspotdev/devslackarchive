    "text": "Hi all, just a quick update for you that we've added an icon picker field in the new design manager. This field will allow your content creators to pick from a dropdown list of font awesome icons when they're building out web pages, making it much easier to swap out icons than it was previously. For more information, check out this blog post <https://designers.HubSpot.com/blog/now-live-icon-fields-added-to-the-new-design-manager>"

If HS can find a way to make it performant they could  combine the two files together on their end though probably not ideal for them."

We are exploring what it might look like to allow users to combine icon sets. As of today I do not have an ETA on that. \n3. No plans as of today to support a paid version though we are exploring a much larger play that touches on integrating paid versions of many “things” into the system",
