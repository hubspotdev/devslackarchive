However, you can add a class to your section's `dnd_section class=\"my-section-class\"`\n\nMore on that in <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/templates/drag-and-drop-areas/sections#section-classes|HubSpot documentation>\n\nHey <@U7SL518D6> <@UQWGKUEN7> is this still the only way of styling sections? Or maybe there is something you're working on in the next updates to add the same option to sections as it is possible for modules?"
