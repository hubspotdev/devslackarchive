    "text": "I have reviewed several posts on HubSpot community for an OAuth connection error that is commonly experienced, but they have not helped in resolving our issue. We are integrating one of our applications with our free HubSpot CRM and are running tests to ensure if our users can connect to the HubSpot CRM from our application successfully via OAuth. Here's the issue:\n\n1. Users *who do not have a Super Admin role, get this error* while trying to connect to HubSpot from our application via OAuth: *Couldn't complete the connection You don't have permission to connect this app.*\n2. I found this post: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/HubSpot-OAuth-FAQ/m-p/262729> to be insightful and understand that \"Whether or not an app can be installed depends on the intersection of the app's required scopes, the account’s included tools, and the authorizing user's roles.\"\n3. We have made sure the non-Super Admin users are assigned the required user permissions that align with our apps required scopes, but we are missing something as we are unable to resolve the above connection error for users who are not Super Admins.\nWhat specific details can I share here for anyone to better assist with this issue?"
