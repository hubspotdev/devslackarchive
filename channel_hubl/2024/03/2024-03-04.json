Everything works fine except when these two modules are called on the same page then the modules stop working.\n\nSeems like the JS file is being called twice even though I use the `{{ require_css(\"path\") }}`  HubL function. Has anyone else experienced the same issue? Any workarounds?\n\nThanks!",

    "text": "Hi all!\nIs there a way to auto-populate a HubDB Table with HubSpot Pages? So my client has like 400 of pages with some resources like documents, webinars, etc, and they want to list all their pages the same way they do with blogs. The trick is they want to filter it by tags, so my solution is to use HubDB but I don't see a good experience in updating it manually (And deploying it) every time they want to add a new resource.\n\nIs there a way to simplify this process? Am I overthinking it?\nThank you!",
