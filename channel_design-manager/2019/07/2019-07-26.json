    "text": "Not sure if this is the correct channel but my company needs a documentation page built. How would you go about building this as usually documentation pages have 10s / 100s of sub pages (tabs). I'm looking into HubDB or pre made themes which I could alter from the marketplace. I normally build pages using the design manager and hubl but it seems like a nightmare to edit such a large thing in the website pages tab. Any help/guidance would be appreciated.",
