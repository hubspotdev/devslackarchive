    "text": "_Hi, I've been looking through the documentation but haven't found my way around this bug yet. Hope someone out there can help me out_ :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n*Issue:*\nI have 2 HubSpot portals (one for dev, one for prod). Yesterday I made 2 new local modules in dev and copied them both to the prod portal. Both modules are copied to 'Design Tools', but only one of the modules is found in the drag n' drop sidebar for my Page template. The main difference between the modules is that a background image is added as an asset to the modules that isn't visible in the sidebar.\n\nI appreciated any help and ideas for this problem :)",
