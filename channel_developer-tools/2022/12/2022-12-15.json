    "text": "Hello guys :spock-hand:.\n\nI was playing with the HubSpot Landing Pages, and was wondering if there is a way, to add a form for registering a user. Right now I found a way add a form, but the form submits a new user, and sends an email.\n\nWhat I would like, would be to somehow add an API call with the user information, and register it on our own server/database.\n\nAlso, while reading and going through the options of Forms, I wasn't able to find an input field for password.\n\nDo you know if this is possible? To create a form with Email &amp; Password and send this data on my own API?\n\nThank you, and I hope I've asked this question on the right channel :joy:",
