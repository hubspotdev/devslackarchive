Please let me know if there is a better channel for this inquiry.\n\nOur sales users are having trouble with their email signatures not displaying correctly. I believe they used the HubSpot email signature generator and are copying and pasting that HTML code into their email signature settings on their profile where it is displaying correctly but when they receive an email task on a contact record through a sequence that fires the email signature is broken and is not displaying correctly.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\nIs anyone able to help diagnose the issue? Could this be related to the sequence and email task that is firing onto a contact record? Is this related to the HTML code being copied and pasted in different places and is losing some of the formatting?"
