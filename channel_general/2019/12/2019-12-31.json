If you just want to schedule a page to be published later that should definitely be possible. If you're in the page editor for your page, there should be a \"Schedule\" tab up top. If you click on that you should have the option to either \"Publish now\" or \"Schedule for later\". If you choose the second option you should be able to select a date and time that your page will be published at."
