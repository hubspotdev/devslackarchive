    "text": "Hmm it might be a workflow bug only, maybe copy the property with custom code instead, and if it stills copies 1 day less, you can do an IF branch and fix it if they are different with custom code. If you dont have custom code, you can make the workflow send a webhook to a tool that can copy the date using the API. That way you avoid using the workflow to copy the date since its buggy."
