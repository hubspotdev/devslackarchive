    "text": "I talked to HS Support about this in November of last year. This is their response\n\nThanks for getting in touch. My name is Joe and I'd be happy to help you with this. You are correct, system pages like 404//500/search results pages don't have multi-language functionality. There is a single version of each page, and this version should default to the domain language.\n\nIf you wanted to render different content on these system pages it would require custom work, you could potentially do something like this:\n\nAssuming a visitor would be going to a URL that would contain one of your language slugs (since they would be clicking on a link/going directly to a page they found somewhere), you could leverage the 'request.path' HubL variable (outlined in <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/variables|docs here>) to check for which language slug is in the URL and then render different content in the header based on which slug was found\n\nThis would require the work of your developers, and is not something we can set up for you. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.\n\nBest,\nJoe"
