You can use the CRM Imports API which allows you to import files with up to 250k records per file (so, 250k records, 1 API call, you just prepare the file first)\n    a. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/blog/using-the-crm-imports-api-to-import-records-in-bulk-into-a-dad-abase>\n    b. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/imports>\n2. If you're using the Company Batch endpoint - There is no way around those rate limits, but you should be able to process your records reasonably quickly. Correct my math if you see this differently, but here's how the math breaks down:\n    a. 140,000 records / 100 records per call = 1,400 total calls\n    b. 1,400 total calls, if processed at max rate limit: 1400/150 = 9.5 \"batches\" of 10 second blocks = ~ 95 seconds for the 1,400 calls"
