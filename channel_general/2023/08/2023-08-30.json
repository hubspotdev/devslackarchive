    "text": "I would say it depends a bit on the content, but either route can work. The most obvious element would be the fact that a landing page would have a lot more flexibility in the page content than a blog post would... as the entire landing page would have drag-n-drop content with access to all of the modules in your theme. Then a blog post would be limited to the blog post template structure.\n\nGenerally, a landing page would be used and include the form with a redirect to the gated content after form submission. Something I've also done within a blog though is a custom module in the blog post template that covers all but the start of the blog post and requires a form to be filled out to view the post. Then after submitting, update a property in the contact that is checked by this module so when that user comes back, they won't have to fill out the form again. That works well for gating blog content as a whole... but if you are gating one-off content items, I'd just roll with landing pages."
