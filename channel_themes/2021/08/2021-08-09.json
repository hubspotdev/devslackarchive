Instead the templates of the original theme are listed twice.\nI did not overwrite any system template with the child theme, but would have expected to be able to select them anyway since they could also fetch a different configuration from the theme settings of the child theme.\nAm I missing something or is this a limitation/bug?"

    "text": "Hi. Came across one new thing. Client on Starter CMS plan couldn't purchase my theme as the buy button is greyed out and it says \"The theme requires access to the CTA tool\".\n\nAny idea how to get around it?\n\nTo me, it looks like I've to create multiple themes now. But it makes no sense limiting buyers like this. How many themes creators have to publish and manage to overcome such limitations?",
