I’m currently trying to build a blog homepage for our blog posts but I’m finding the stock ‘post-listing’ module lacking the right features so I’m guessing yours is custom code? I just need to be able to pull through a list of posts onto the homepage, each with an image, title, date etc. that users can then click on. Thanks!",

Any template specified there will then gain the capability to list off blogs for the purpose of listing.\n\nTo list through your blog-listings just use\n\n```\n{% for content in contents %}\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nAnd then you can use content.featured_image etc to grab blog data."

Basically HubSpot provide a way to stage the \"content\" of pages, however, if i modify the structure of a page template, module, stylesheets,   javascript files etc, HS does not provide  a way to stage them, so i would have to clone them,  link them to the staged page and when i'm happy with all the changes copy them to production.? To those of you with more experience with HS, what's the way you organize your files in order to have a staging version of you site? Thank you",
