    "text": "Hello :slightly_smiling_face:  The image in pop up forms is really too small and there's also no way of positioning it. I would love to see a lot of customisation here. Change the image size, its position to being above title, on the left or right and paddings/margins. We tried 3rd party software but it seems to be a bit of a problem performance wise.",
