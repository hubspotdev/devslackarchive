    "text": "Hello Devs,\nI hope this message finds you well. I am in the process of preparing my app for submission to the HubSpot Marketplace. However, I would like to clarify a few points before proceeding.\nCurrently, I do not have a separate documentation page or marketing collateral specifically for the app. The only reference to HubSpot is on our integration page, where users can integrate HubSpot with our system. The page includes the HubSpot logo and name to indicate the integration.\nCould you please confirm if having separate documentation and marketing materials is compulsory for publishing on the marketplace, or if it is acceptable to proceed with the current setup?\nI appreciate your guidance on this matter and look forward to your response.\nThank you for your time and assistance."
