    "text": "Hey Zachary :wave: the `layout.css` file is typically used for drag and drop in HubSpot but you could likely use it in other places if you wanted to. This is based on an old version of bootstrap and the way I read it is that there are the base styles for all breakpoints at the top and then there are some additional media queries to handle scenarios on smaller/larger screens but if there is no media query specified it falls back to the base styles at the top.\n\nIn general this is definitely something we are interested in updating so that the grid is more modern and simple in terms of the code used (open issue on updating this can be found here: <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/issues/319>)."
