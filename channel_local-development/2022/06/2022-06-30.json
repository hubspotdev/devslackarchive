    "text": "Has anyone else experienced `The following entrypoint(s) combined asset size exceeds the recommended limit (244 KiB)`  when building modules with React? Currently doing this in production as it minifies the files, but at the cost of compilation speed. If I were to do this with development mode, it would be too big, but improved compile speed, and HS would simply reject the file.\n\n<@U7SL518D6> not sure if you have any tips here"
