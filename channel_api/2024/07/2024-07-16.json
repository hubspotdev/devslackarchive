I provisioned my API to 'seemingly' meet the requirements regarding payload, etc., but receive nothing but a 400 response and null error message from HubSpot. The subscription trigger is an object created event.\n\nI'm also unsure if this is the proper place to ask this question, so any assist on both fronts is appreciated! (edited)"
