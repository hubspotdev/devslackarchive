    "text": "Hey there <@U02KDL17021> We have a few resources that can help answer these questions for you.\n\nIf you’re looking to build your first module I recommend:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started-with-modules>\n\nIt’s a tutorial where you’ll create a module and add it to a drag and drop area on a template. As well as add the module to a page.\n\nI’m happy to recommend some other resources to give you a birds eye view of how it all works.\n\n\nIf you’ve got a background doing WordPress development this video series will help a lot:\n<https://youtu.be/58y54YC3EtU>\n\nOtherwise the HubSpot CMS for developers course can be helpful:\n<https://academy.HubSpot.com/courses/cms-for-developers>\n\n(These resources are all free)\n\n\nTo quickly answer you’re questions though\n1. I’m not 100% sure what you’re asking but will try: You add your module fields to your module’s fields.json file. If working with the JSON feels difficult to you, an easy way to ease into it is to use the Design Manager’s module editor. You can always copy the JSON for the fields.json file from the module editor. The page editor automatically understands this JSON and renders fields for the module allowing the content creator to add content to the module.\n2. Modules do not need to be imported like you would in a JavaScript framework, they’re a separate concept. You can still use a JS framework in addition to them if you want to but that’s optional.\n\n3. The HubL drag and drop tags make it so in the page editor the content creator has a way to drag and drop modules/sections/columns/rows around on the page. As a developer you can predefine drag and drop areas and their default appearance."
