    "text": "Hi Everyone! I have two more, I think easy questions.\n1. Now that my theme is published, I want to start pushing some updates and changes to it. Mostly minor ‘nice to have’ types of things. If I re-submit, does my theme get taken off the marketplace until the new version is approved? I dont think so, but would love confirmation.\n2. I am assuming the theme submission queue is still quite large with the contest just ending. Are tehre any updated timelines on getting things re-approved?",
