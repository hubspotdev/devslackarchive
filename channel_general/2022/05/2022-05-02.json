We know this, we see this, and we want to make your experience better.\n\n:broom: In an effort to streamline this community and make it easier to connect with your fellow developers, *we’re going to be archiving the total number of public channels, as well as renaming others.* (sneak peek at the changes <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fnwCzrYD2fLNPCYP7NNshTJi4gM36vWpHBTU0ALQaSQ/edit#gid=1564945604|here>):broom:\n\nWe’ll be providing updates in every channel impacted in advance of these changes, and the updates will go live in one week, on *May 9th*. We will be archiving channels (meaning they will still be searchable, none of your previous posts will be lost), so if we get feedback from y’all that any channel we’ve archived needs to be brought back, we will do so.\n\n:sparkles:We’re hopeful this will be the first of many steps designed to help connect HubSpot developers allover the world and help you build with us more effectively!:sparkles:",
