    "text": "Hi, I don't know if it's not a stupid question, but I've got stuck on trying to connect with HubSpot api.\n\nI want to list pages (like posts in blog index, but specifically pages), and I've been told by support, that the only way to list pages on my site is to connect with my sites api from my site. And there's the problem, because I don't know how to do that, because any ajax request generates cors problem (I've red that HubSpot just doesn't support it) and I can't find any method in hubl to make get request. I was thinking about adding some php integration, but I've red that it's a bad idea.\n\nIs there any way to that \"by the book\" (without some hacks)?",
