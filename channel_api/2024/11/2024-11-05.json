I need to create an *auto-reply WhatsApp message for unknown contacts* who start a conversation after business hours.\n\nSince HubSpot does not offer an auto-reply feature, I am considering creating a workflow based on conversations. I plan to use custom code to retrieve the WhatsApp contact phone number of the sender, create a new contact, associate it with the conversation, and send a WhatsApp template based on our office hours criteria.\n\nI noticed that the endpoint `/conversations/v3/conversations/threads/{threadId}` returns an `associatedContactId`. However, I encountered an issue when trying to get information about the associated contact by using `/crm/v4/objects/conversations/$threadId/associations/0-1/$associatedContactId`; it returned a \"405 Method Not Allowed\" error.\n\nIs there a way to automatically generate contacts from WhatsApp conversations? Or is there another method to set up an auto-reply for WhatsApp messages from unknown contacts?",
