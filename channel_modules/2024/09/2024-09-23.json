    "text": "I have youtube videos for a podcast that are scheduled to go live, and I'm trying to schedule a post with the video embed in it (using the video module) to go live at the same time. However, HubSpot is bound and determined not to let me do this. I'm getting an error that says “You can't embed this media URL for sharing” and it won’t put the URL in the page, though it will save it in the module settings.\n\nI tried to schedule it anyways to see if by the time the page goes live the video would work, but indeed it did not, I had to go back in and save the module again and publish.\n\nI know HubSpot is trying to be \"smart\" but the video will be published when the post is published.\n\nAfter further testing it looks like I can put in an embed code with my unpublished video and it will save, but it won’t use the video thumbnail and it also doesn’t fill the space like I can set it with the oembed option.\n\nI figured I can clone and modify the plugin to where it takes that check out, or maybe add a new field for the URL in the module that has no such check in place yet, but I’ve been having some trouble making those updates and getting them to work. I think probably the first solution of not allowing the url to save if the video is unpublished would be the cleanest solution … any idea how to go about doing that?\n\nAlso posted this to community: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Video-Module-won-t-allow-unpublished-videos/m-p/1044698#M40724>",
