    "text": "Hey guys! :wave: :wave:\n\nHas anyone already tried configuring the Web Vitals library but through Google Tag Manager (GA4)? <https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#send-the-results-to-google-tag-manager>\n\nI managed to add variables and events from the template according to the instructions - unfortunately in this template Datalayer object only contains 6 parameters:\nid, name, value, delta, valueRounded, deltaRounded.\n<https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-core-web-vitals-in-ga4-with-google-tag-manager/#:~:text=This%20is%20what,object%20contains%3A>\n\nDo any of you know how to add for e.g. an eventTarget using this template (as a debug_target, so that it is clear which element affects which metric)? Or simply in the code but without using the gtag() method as it is not present on my site, as I am using a script with GTM and not gtag. I don't see this in the readme on github. I would be grateful for hints"
