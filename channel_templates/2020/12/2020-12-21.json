    "text": "Good morning, i've got a question about creating pagination inside the blog list template. Currently we show all blogs using the following variable:\n{% set contents = blog_recent_posts('default', 100) %}\n\nAnd we loop over these blogs with a basic for loop:\n{% for content in contents %}\n\nWe would like to have some pagination, since the amount of blogs is steadily growing. However, there does not seem to be a built in function for this, or any working examples. Did anybody else have this problem, and how did you solve it?",
