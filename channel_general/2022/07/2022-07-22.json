It’s a standard web feature, you make your own actual HTML elements, that the browser knows how to render.\n\nYou can certainly just like with any HTML use it in tandem with HubL to make the editing experience great.\n\nBest of all, because it’s using built-in web technology, you can plug your web components into any JS framework and it largely just works (Some frameworks may have minor things you have to do just to tell the framework it exists)."
