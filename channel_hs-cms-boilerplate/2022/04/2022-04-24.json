I can not change in dnd, where can I change them?\nIf I would go with a new template, theme, and modules from scratch, I think I wouldn't really make it till Friday. I know how to connect the module I created, as you showed me yesterday. But as I want to use what they have, where can I rewrite the codes I need? So there are the sections for example (message from yesterday), the style of those boxes with the line around, that should be simple css.\nanother exmp; can I change the color of the outlined button in the module or somewhere else?\n\nThank BJ!",
