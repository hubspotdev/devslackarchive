The most common things that cause this is when the particular mobile chatflow hasn't been turned to the \"on\" status in the portal chatflows (rightmost toggle in its row) or that the mobile tag (in your plist, \"default\") doesn't match any mobile chatflows that are on. Please check those settings and let us know if there might be something different causing this for you."
