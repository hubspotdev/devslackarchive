I usually use recursion in my functions getting all contacts, basically make the call once, process the response data, then before the close of the function use an if statement to see if \"has-more\" != false, then execute the function again, applying the value of \"vid-offset\" (from the response) to the \"vidOffset\" param of the call function. Kinda twists your brain at first, running a function from within itself."
