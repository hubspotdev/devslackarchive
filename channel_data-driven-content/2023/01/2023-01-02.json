    "text": "We have multiple business units (different countries and multiple locations in same country) in the same portal, they all have unique webinars.\nWe want to have a Webinar HubDB per BU, because they have different needs for columns and/or filtering options.\nAll these should generate dynamic pages.\nThis means a rather big query, with a collection per HubDB.\nHowever, with GraphQL I want to keep it simple, and not need to create a query per HubDB, furthermore not needing to create a module per HubDB.\n\n\nI dabbled a bit in child tables, but I’m simply not grasping how to generate the query, this is how far I’ve gotten so far:\nLet’s say we have “UK” as a country, this country is selected on a “Country” table, where we can select (foreign id) the child tables we need (Webinars, Seminars, you name it), for specifically UK.\nThe query would be something like:\n```query webinarsByCountry($country: String) {\n  HUBDB {\n    country_collection(filter: {country__eq: $brand}) {\n      items {\n        country\n        hs_child_table_collection {\n          ... on hubdb_courses_uk_collection {\n            items {\n              title\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}```\nSo this would show me all webinars on “UK”’s child table, however I need to hardcode the `… on` parameter.\nIs it possible to use the `$country` variable in some way to grab the child table?\n\nMaybe I’m overthinking it, maybe the solution is right under my nose. Right now I’m just not seeing it.",
