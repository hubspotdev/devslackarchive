    "text": "Is there a way to get the unit values inputted into a spacing field without calling the CSS property? I’d like to feed those values into some custom properties.\n\nBased on the documentation, you’re able to call `spacing.margin.direction.value` to get the numerical value, but `spacing.margin.direction.units` returns an array of all valid unit types without specifying which one is actually being inputted. This is opposed to something like the Font field, which returns the inputted size unit via the `size_unit` property.\n\nI could work around this by restricting users to inputting a single unit type, but I’d prefer to retain the flexibility of letting users define units themselves."
