    "text": "Hello, I would like to find out whether it is possible that a member can not just view but also edit certain CRM objects. The most simple use-case I want to establish would be that \"partner\" companies can have members who will be able to maintain their own contacts. I am happy to answer any question that may arise and I am looking forward to get an answer on the feasibility of this use-case. Thanks in advance!",
