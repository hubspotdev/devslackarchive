That's cool but that can be done only once, when the page is loaded. The point of us using React is to have a single page app and avoid all the loading on every click. What I was thinking with my question is about using HubL within React components, so I can manipulate with it on the React component level, and not on HubSpot page level.\n\nI don't know HubSpot's architecture nor whether this would be possible in any way, but since HubSpot is built via React too I thought maybe there is a way. :slightly_smiling_face:"
