    "text": "Is there a loop to run through and display everything from a certain category (tag), just like there is for author? On a blog we’re working on I’ve successfully set it up so that the main feed has one blog at the top from the ‘Featured’ category, with 6 below it from every category. And then I have the author page figured out. However, the category pages I can’t figure out how to do the same. Thanks! <https://blog.thebristal.com>",
