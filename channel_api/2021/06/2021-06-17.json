The values for that module are not then stored to the page. So when you use the API you wouldn’t see the values for those fields in the API.\n\nIf you edit the page, and change the value of each field in the module to be something other than their default value. That is now saved to the page. So using the API you will be able to see those fields appear in the data for that module.\n\n\nThe reason this happens is because we “cascade the default values”.\n\nSo for example if you added the module to a page but never touched it. the values it shows on the page are the template level default values for the module. IF template level default values were set.\n\nIf template level default values were not set by the template’s developer. Then it will show the module’s default values.\n\nIf the module has been edited in the page, it’s data is saved to the page. (which is what the API gets)."

A page can use that template, and that module will automatically be in the page.\n\nCMS Hub has a full drag and drop experience built for marketers - if a template contains a `dnd_area` or flexible column, they can add a module directly into the page in the location where that `dnd_area` or flexible column exists.\n\nRegardless of whether the module was added through the template code or through the page editor UI, the module will be in the page.\n\nIt’s field values (the 2 different text fields I mentioned) would not appear in the data returned by the API unless in the page editor that data has actually been edited."
