(Email Subscription Preferences/Subscription Confirmation/etc.)\n\nSolutions for other system pages largely assume that you’ll have some level of control over the URL of the link that leads to the system page — however, that solution doesn’t work when we’re required to use the `{{ unsubscribe_link }}` tag to generate the link to the system page.\n\nHas anyone found a good solution for making sure that users land on a preferences page that’s in the same language as the email that sent them there?"
