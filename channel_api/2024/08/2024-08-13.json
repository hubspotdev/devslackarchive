Do you both work at <http://cm.com|cm.com>?\n\nAnyway, the good news is that the reason that sending messages/initializing conversations endpoints are not available is that we've been building a sister API that largely covers what you are asking after. The Custom Channels API is now in private beta, and you'll be able to read docs about it and try it when we go to public beta soon."
