If we haven't met my name's Mark and I'm a designer on our developer projects team.\nWe're on a small mission to better understand how you all are using projects, specifically around deleting things and what the expected behavior is there. So if you have a few minutes I'd love if you could help out by answering a couple questions if they apply:\n\n• Have you ever tried *deleting a project* from the management UI? What happened? Did it work how you expected?\n• Have you ever deployed a new build that *removed a component (app, react module)* that was previously deployed? Did that work how you expected?\n• Why were you deleting things from the project? What was the goal/context?\n• Any other feedback or thoughts on the overall project/component lifecycle?\nFeel free to respond right in this thread. I may DM individuals to dig in further if that's OK. Thanks for your time!",
