Sometimes there are \"types of documents\" such as DNI, Passport, etc. All of them with different number of digits. So i think HS could improve its conditional rules in forms :smile:"

    "text": "I found this to be a helpful resource (<https://pustelto.com/blog/optimizing-css-for-faster-page-loads/>). It kind of coincides with Gonzalo's approach in the thread linked above (<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/A-place-to-gather-resources-issues-and-solutions-to-optimize/m-p/364766/highlight/true#M18303>). We've started to use this a little bit in boilerplate and while the improvements were minor because we don't have a ton of default CSS it was still helpful to slightly reduce the render blocking warning (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/wiki/Performance> 7-10 there). You can check how much unused code you have using the coverage tab which is also super helpful (<https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/coverage>). There were also a couple of performance improvements to the require_js and require_css HubL functions which allow for defer/async that might be useful too (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/hubl-updates-for-speed-enhancement>)."
