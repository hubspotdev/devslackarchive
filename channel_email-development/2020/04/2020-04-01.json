    "text": "I’m a bit confused about what approach to use for building emails for clients.\n\nThere is a new drag and drop editor, but I can’t seem to make templates and the width seems to be fixed to 600px? I have changed the content width in settings/marketing/email but can’t see it change.\n\nThere’s a drag and drop template type, but I can’t seem to find how I set the layout and design for this template?\n\nLast resort is to code it from scratch but client feels locked down using this approach.\n\nWhat are the recommendations?"
