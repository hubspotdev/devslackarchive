A guest on our website completes a native form which via a handler submits the details to HubSpot (this works great). But ideally I would then like to be able to track this guest’s web activity within HubSpot. I think previously we used to send a cookie value to HubSpot to relate the now known guest. Is this still possible or am I missing something obvious here? Or making no-sense! Many thanks.",
