I'm just exploring a random thought I had last night at 3AM... \"Why aren't folks connecting HubDB into the vast world of Zapier integrations?\"\n\nI wasn't sure if there was something technical limiting it (I'm not a developer, so IDK :upside_down_face:).\n\nCool to hear it miiiiight be possible... Hopefully we'll see more people pushing the limits and opening up the CMS using it. :slightly_smiling_face:"
