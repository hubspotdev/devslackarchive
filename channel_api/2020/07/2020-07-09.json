    "text": "I started using the  php HubSpot/api-client today. And i am curious why the openapi generator is used to create the code? Every object has the same classes like `Filter`, `FliterGroup` and so on. It is easy to add the wrong classes. A developer user experience improvement would be to make a helper methods to point developers to the right API class. For instance `$hubSpot-&gt;crm()-&gt;contacts()-&gt;searchApi()` could become `$HubSpot-&gt;CRMContactsSearchApi`, that way IDE's can autocomplete the methods again. Now you have to go through the code or make a variable and typehint the variable to let the IDE's do their work.",
