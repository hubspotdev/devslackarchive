    "text": "An idea that just popped into my head — I’d love some sort of control panel for managing the rollout of breaking changes to existing portals. HubSpot has typically been very good about legacy support and not pushing breaking changes to existing portals, but there have been cases where I *want* to adopt a new version of a feature on an older portal. It’d be great to be able to opt a portal in to a certain breaking change, once I’ve confirmed that I’ve accounted for it!"
