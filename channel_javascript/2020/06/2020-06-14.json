    "text": "I was able to add PWA functionality to a React app by hosting the manifest and js bundles on hubfs. After putting the files in the file manager, I created a template that imports the assets and renders the app. Hereâ€™s a snippet of the start of my template where the manifest is loaded:\n\n```&lt;!--\n  templateType: \"page\"\n  isAvailableForNewContent: true\n--&gt;\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"Your description\" /&gt;\n        {{ standard_header_includes }}\n    &lt;link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"<https://www.yourdomain.com/hubfs/pathToProject/manifest.json>\" /&gt;```\nYou also need to include the correct meta tags and icon links for the devices you are targeting in the template.  Check out <https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator> for an easy way to generate those. Once generated, you can just copy and paste them into the head tag of the template.\n\nLmk if you have any issues"
