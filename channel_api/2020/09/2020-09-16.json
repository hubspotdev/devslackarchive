    "text": "Hello everyone, I need an information about the API engagement if anybody can help :pray:\n\nHi there ! I got a problem retrieving data from the API (<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/engagements/engagements-overview>)\n\nFor example the API send me task suppressed by users on HubSpot. Is it normal ?\n\nI'm working with python I request the data from this route :\n```<https://api.hubapi.com/engagements/v1/engagements/paged>```\nI get the request including the offset. There's no problem in my code since I manage to get all the data from the API. However, the API send me suppressed data such as suppressed note or suppressed task which I can't understand since it doesn't appear in HubSpot.\n\nIs it normal for HubSpot, could it be that I need to add a extra param to my request to get only not suppressed data ?"
