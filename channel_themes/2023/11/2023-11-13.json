    "text": "Hello hello.  I am currently using Power Pro with a child theme.  usually I clone all of the templates and then disable the ones I donâ€™t want with the   isAvailableForNewContent: false switch at the top of the template however this time all of the original power pro templates are still showing up in my list of choices when I create a new web page.  Any thoughts?   Thinking it was cached I waited for a couple hours but they are all still there."
