    "text": "Hello everybody,\nWe got the beta ungated for our dev portal and are very excited to try it out :fire:\nOne thing we noticed is that theme modules are not listed in the page editor anymore. This also applies to HubSpot’s themes, e.g. the Growth theme, see <https://take.ms/rFzEAi>.\nAfter deactivating the beta on that portal the modules were showing again.\nThose themes do use non-React modules, but maybe it is related to the beta.\nDoes anybody else experience this?\nHave a nice weekend :otter::v:",

Not sure it's related to the beta though as it only started happening last week and we've had the beta active longer than that. Last I heard from support is \"My team mentioned they see where the issue is It appears that the `limit` query param isn't working as one might expect. They plan on having a fix ungated over the next few days.\"."
