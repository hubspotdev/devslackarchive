    "text": "Hello Guys.\n\nI'm new to HubSpot (as you can imagine) and facing some issues that I guessed it should de quicker or easier or I'm just doing the incorrect thing... So I need some help!!\n\nApp: react front end\n\n\nI'm having some issues with the update on the _hsq.\n\n1. For example: When the user enters the login page I already have the tracking code up and running. When the user log into the app (before the redirect) I'm setting the hsq with the user identification:\n```  var _hsq = window._hsq = window._hsq || [];\n      _hsq.push([\"identify\",{\n        email: \"email\",\n      }]);\n      _hsq.push(['setPath', '/login']);\n      _hsq.push(['trackPageView']);\n      _hsq.push(['refreshPageHandlers'])\n      _hsq.push([\"trackCustomBehavioralEvent\", {\n          email: loginResponseV2.data.user.email, \n          name: loginResponseV2.data.user.firstName \n        }\n      ]);```\n\nI'm doing all after the identify to update the front end, but it only happens when I refresh the page. Can I achieve that without refreshing the page?\n\n<https://jam.dev/c/92968a23-e7ce-4fc6-b983-c9d9d704806f>\n\n2) When the user logs out it still keep track of the user identify. For example. I log in with user \"X\" that has a CTA on the logged in session, but when I logout is still showing.\n\nEven if I try a lot of things to empty the tracking code like:\n\n\n``` var _hsq = window._hsq = window._hsq || [];\n    _hsq = [];\n    _hsq.push(['doNotTrack']);\n    _hsq.push(['refreshPageHandlers'])\n    _hsq.push(['trackPageView']);\n    _hsq.push([\"identify\",{\n       email: '',\n     }]);```\nBut that wont clear the user id. For example, I have a CTA for an user, and it will shown here or even the name on the chat. So I want to avoid any id in the external url.\n\n<https://jam.dev/c/608c0d3e-c97d-4ea2-b14e-d7ec7c757f9f>",
