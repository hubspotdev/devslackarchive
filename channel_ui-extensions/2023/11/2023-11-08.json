    "text": "Hi Everyone, hoping to see if anyone else has run into this before. I have a custom card that is working correctly, However the card is under contacts right now, and when I make the adjustment to move it over to deals, I get an error. I also tested using an example from the git repo that displays on deals, and I am getting the same error. I'm not having much luck fixing this thus far, if anyone has any ideas I'd appreciate it greatly!",
