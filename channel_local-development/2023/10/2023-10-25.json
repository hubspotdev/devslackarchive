    "text": "<@U05RNDM3VM2> I see, unfortunately that isn't a supported feature.  Local dev mode only engages for the machine that is running `hs project dev` and the other users only see what is currently deployed.  If you want to achieve this you could attempt to forward the ports being used by `hs project dev` from the machine you wish to view it on to the remote machine.  I haven't attempted this, so I can't promise it will work, and it does come with caveat that the `hs project dev` doesn't always use the same ports (depending on availability)."
