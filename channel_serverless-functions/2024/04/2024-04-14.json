    "text": "what's the difference between `sendResponse` and `return` in a serverless function? In my code here:\n```     const formattedPosts = {\n        posts: response.data?.data.BLOG.post_collection.items,\n        total: response.data?.data.BLOG.post_collection.total,\n      };\n\n      sendResponse({\n        statusCode: 200,\n        body: formattedPosts,\n      });\n\n      return {\n        statusCode: 200,\n        body: formattedPosts,\n      };```\nsendResponse works as expected but the return is successful but does not include any data. What else is sendResponse doing?"
