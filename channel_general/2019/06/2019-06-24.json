    "text": ":wave: This is amazing! I think we're definitely open to digital events in the future. We know not everyone can travel all the time, so this is a first step, being lead by our community members. We haven't had high attendance for virtual AMAs in the past so we decided to pause those while we rethink and really focus on the core foundation of the overall developer experience itself (tooling, resources, etc). if there's interest in other events, webinars, etc, we're definitely open to hearing more and trying experiments whenever possible to support you all."
