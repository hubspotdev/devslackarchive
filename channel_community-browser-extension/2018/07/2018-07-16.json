If you are experiencing this issue - you can cause Google chrome to update your extensions by doing one of a few things:\n1. close google chrome completely, re-open it. \n2. go to <chrome://extensions> toggle “Developer mode” click update.(you can turn developer mode off again if you want.\n3. wait for Google Chrome to push the update to you, this could take a few days if you do not close google chrome often."
