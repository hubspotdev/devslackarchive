I am guessing the `file id` of the attached file is not being updated with the new file in the new portal",

    "text": "Got an old bug bugging me that’s been around since the early beta days of the new design manager, I’ve reported it multiple times, still experiencing it.\n\nIf you:\n1. clone a module from portal A  to Portal B.\n2. move cloned module from the folder it’s in to another folder\n3. delete the folder the module brought over with it.\n4. Module works fine and is visible, and that folder is correctly not visible in the finder (it’s supposed to be deleted)\n5. Now clone another custom module from Portal A to portal B\n6. This module and any associated files are now floating in outer space :rocket: The module and the files exist and can be found using the search but cannot be seen in the finder thus cannot be moved, renamed or cloned elsewhere.\n\nThe “deleted” folder shows in FTP and you can see the files/modules located within.\n\nFortunately using FTP you can fix the issue yourself. But before the designs folder was added to the FTP there was nothing you could do at all\n\nI’ve used the FTP method to solve my current problem, but would appreciate it if someone fixed this as we clone modules a lot, and we delete the containing folders because they reference the other site"
