For example, we have a custom object called \"Inspection Data,\" and we want users who are logged into the membership site to see Inspection Data records associated with their company. So an employee from Company A who's logged into the website can only see Company A's Inspection Data, but they cannot see Company B's inspection data.\n\nHopefully that makes sense.... thanks, everyone!",

You could just use the {{contact}} variable, which will give you the ID, among a variety of other properties.\n\nThere are a few ways to go about retrieving the associated data - the most appropriate likely being the hubl, crm_associations() function.
