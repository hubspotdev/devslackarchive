It’s been at least 4 months since this was added, any news or updates on the progress of this?",

    "text": "Hey Dustin, the short answer is yes we plan to expand this functionality, and no we don’t have a hard ETA just yet.\n\nThe long answer:\nThere are actually a lot of intermingled features that we want to get right with the responsive breakpoints functionality before we support additional breakpoints. If done poorly we risk providing a developer or content creator experience that is confusing or difficult to work with. Being such a fundamental functionality it’s hard to make changes to it once it’s released. Stay tuned. We’ll definitely communicate when we open up that functionality via the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog|developer changelog.>"
