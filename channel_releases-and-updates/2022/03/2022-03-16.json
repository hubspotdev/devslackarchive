    "text": "<@U7SL518D6> Using the new HubSpot Video Hosting, the quality of the video thumbnail looks very blurry. It seems that the player creates the image automatically with a resolution of 600 x 338px (also if you upload a custom thumbnail image). Are there any chances, that it will be possible to define a thumbnail image in the correct size, so the thumbnail does not look blurry? (Or maybe it is already possible and I missed something?)"
