    "text": "Hi all, I am working on the development of a new template with contact form and map. I am quite new as Hubspost developer (only 2 months), and in these last days I learnt a lot how to add the functionalities to the pages, but there is still something that I miss in the logic of the development of a template. I mean, I know how to develop a basic template, but if I have to add a background image also if I add the functionality I can't see it as background.\nmaybe it is because JS or there are other reasons in HubSpot logic?",
