I'm currently working on setting up a workflow in HubSpot to automatically register people for a Teams webinar when they fill out a formâ€”similar to what we do with Zoom. I'm following the instructions, but I'm having trouble finding the webhook URL and HubSpot App ID needed to integrate the registration. I reached out to support and they sent me here!\n\nIf anyone has experience with this or could guide me through the process, I'd greatly appreciate your help! I'd love to learn how to do this step-by-step if possible.\n\nThanks so much in advance for any assistance!",

A colleague of mine is having a little issue with a \"simple workflow\" created within the Forms tool.\nAs of this morning, he is not able to save changes made to actions within the simple workflow editor. We're trying to add a new property to this ticket that is created through the workflow.\n\nI appreciate any help or direction here. I think there's an issue with the UI, as the save button is missing on the left panel. Thanks!",
