    "text": "Hello, I am trying to recreate a module in a new theme that I’m using.\n\nI cloned the original module and placed it into the relevant folder so that it can be dragged/dropped via the theme’s editor. Then, I copied the `module.html` (HTML + HubL) and the `module.css` files to the recreated module.\n\nThe HTML elements are rendering on the page, so I know it’s hooked up properly, but many of the styles are still broken because the original module was relying on a different global stylesheet. Is there a way I can “include” or “import” that stylesheet into the module itself? It’s a fairly complex module, with filters and search, since it’s one that requires the use of a HubDB (hub database).\n\nThank you. Happy to jump on a call, too, if it’s easier to explain/screenshare.",
