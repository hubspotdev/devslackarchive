    "text": "Hi all! We are currently facing an issue where some of our modules won't render on the live version of our pages. Instead of showing the module, it now renders a placeholder like in the picture below. They seem to be fine when visiting the pages for the first time, but after that we just receive the placeholder. This leads me to believe there is a caching issue in de the render logic. Does anyone know how to resolve this by any chance? (This happens with both React and hubl modules)",
