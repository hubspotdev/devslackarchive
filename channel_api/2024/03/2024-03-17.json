Tried to answer quickly on Friday while being pressed on time.\nSpent the last two hours trying to figure this out, but failed.\nRuled out quite a number of things like the subject, content, headers, hs_email_thread_id and many, many others. But still can't replicate the issue.\nAsked support to look into this in more detail. Weird one."
