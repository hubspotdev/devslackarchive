Great job coming together to put something amazing together :smile: :rocket:\n\nHere is a quick doc outlining some information <@U22VBL87M> and I chatted about, with some next steps if you are interested in playing around with concepts/tools we talked about: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FiA-wFENwZ1cGFWJA9oYjzRRD76cgxZXwfXeJcakkU/edit?usp=sharing>\n\n*NOTE*: The first accounts we will be ungating for the noted soon-to-be-beta features when they are ready will be Developer Sandbox Portals, so make sure to spin one up here (<https://offers.HubSpot.com/free-cms-developer-sandbox>) and fill out the form in the doc\n\nThanks for listening.
