    "text": "Hi everyone - Hoping I can get some assistance diagnosing an issue I am having with CTAs dropping part of the tracking code.  We use standard UTM codes in our buttons and links but add an &amp;r=[internal code] Here is an example: <https://www.worthybonds.com?utm_source=HubSpot&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=2024_tax_newsletter&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;r=2024_tax_newsletter>\nWhen adding this to our buttons, the links carry all the code but when using a CTA, it drops the r= code and our back end systems cannot track the link activity. Anyone had a similar experience and have some advice? Thanks in advance.",
