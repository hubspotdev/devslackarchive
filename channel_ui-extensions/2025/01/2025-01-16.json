    "text": "Hey, team) :spock-hand:\nI’m from PandaDoc, and we are working on upgrading our HubSpot UI extension.\nOne of the missing possibilities for us is installing our private packages to the extension. As for example, we want to analyse and log extension errors to Sentry. We have our own lib with the Sentry wrapper. We store this on JFrog. To install it we need to visit JFrog storage with the private token. The issue is that we don’t control the build and deploy process of the extension. It happens on HubSpot’s side. Therefore we need to somehow get this token during the build process. Sending it directly with the app doesn’t look secure.\nDo you have any suggestions of how we can solve this problem? Maybe there is some sort of realisation of env variables, or we can set up this key securely in the account?",

This is a bit urgent so if someone could look into it soon, that will be very much appreciated !\n\nThe document says “_Developers with access to Sales or Service Hub Enterprise can now use CRM development tools to build UI extensions (custom cards) based on a new technology stack with React as frontend. These extensions can be displayed on the middle column tab or the sidebar of the record page_.” - *Does that mean a developer cannot develop this UI extension public app in a Free tier  ? Also client who do not have Enterprise account cannot install this app from marketplace  ?*\n\nSecondly, I also came across this article below which talks about developing public app card which seems to be in free tier so  I am confused as which one should be used to generate a “Public app card”?\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/integrations/install-and-manage-app-cards>\n\nCC: <@U03FJQPSC0Y>  Appreciate any guidance here if possible",
