These are redirects that would typically be applied to every page on the site and therefore wouldnâ€™t be done manually.\n\nTwo examples would be: http to https - every page should redirect from the http version to the https version, and non-trailing slash URLs to trailing slash URLs - every page should redirect from, e.g. <http://domain.co/blog|domain.co/blog> to <http://domain.co/blog/|domain.co/blog/>.",
