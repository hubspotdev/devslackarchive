    "text": "Hi guys!\nI have a question related to the many modules I have already (75) :toolbox: and I feel that this is growing and growing, and maybe I’m applying the concept of “module” in the wrong way. I though to turn all my website components into “modules” so it’s easier to reuse those elements. For example, instead having a 2 col module with a slider and text and icons, I might create 2 separate modules for each component….\n\nCurrently I’m avoiding the DND areas, so my team don’t move things around but they can edit some fields. It would be interesting what’s your current approach when building blocks, modules, etc… at least to have a reference and to find the path to a better reusability. Let me know your thoughts!  :slightly_smiling_face:"
