    "text": "~Hello! I'm having trouble filtering a hubdb_table_rows call using a contact property in a programmable email, having tried both query and selectattr based filtering.~\n~If I hard code the filter `\"value=TestVal\"` I get the proper results. But if I set it to a contact property, `\"value=\"~contact.value`  it always returns 0 results.~\n~If I echo out the query and paste it directly into the filter, it works, but the contact property as a filter does not. Any ideas?~\n\nTurns out, I had to re-tick the programmable email button again"
