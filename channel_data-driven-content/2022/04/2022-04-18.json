Really i am using this  as an alternative to the engagements search api due to its quite nice filtering capabilities(Having more then 3 filters is required for this), and the abilities to retrieve only the total, when that is the only data I need. For my particular solution I would like to have this in an app for this to separate out the rate limits."
