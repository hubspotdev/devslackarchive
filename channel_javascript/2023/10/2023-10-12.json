    "text": "Hey devs!\n\nI am working on getting one of our clients websites in compliance with their opt-out consent model. This requires that I modify all scripts on a page such that the controlling script can modify them if a user opts-out of tracking. For instance in need to modify ‹script type=“text/javascript” id=“hs-script-loader” async defer src=“/hs/scriptloader/2675965.js”&gt;&lt;/script&gt; to ‹script tvpe=“text/plain” class=“optanon-category-C0004” id=“hs-script-loader” async defer src=“/hs/scriptloader/2675965.js”&gt;&lt;/script&gt; adding in the class=“optanon-category-C0004\" and changin the type from text/javascript to text/plain. I have done this for most of the scripts on our site but I am having issues with the HubSpot scripts that are injected at the top of the header. I can’t find a way to modify these scripts. Also, they are being placed before the script that controls the other scripts from loading or being deleted.\n\nFrom my research it seems that this may not be possible. We don’t have any ability to modify the injected scripts. I hope there is some way around this. If anyone knows how I would appreciate it greatly. Thanks!",
