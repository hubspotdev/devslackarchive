    "text": "Hello to all,\nPlease say if this was the ok place to ask this question.  Im new to HS.\nI built a simple module using HTML/ Hubl.  I am having trouble aligning the columns to the top.  (I believe the issue is that they are vertical_alignment='MIDDLE')  I have tried vertical_alignment='TOP'. I have tried flex-direction:flex-start!important.  If i take away the rule i get errors.  I have googled to fix this and find only the flex solution that does not seem to help.\n\nPlease see image for reference.  THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP!",
