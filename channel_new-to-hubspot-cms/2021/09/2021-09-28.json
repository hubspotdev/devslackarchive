    "text": "Hi all. Has anyone ever experienced the following? I created multiple custom coded templates. Each type of page has an own template think of homepage, contact and conversion page. When I created and edit a page, all settings of the macro's are reset in the module settings.\n\n*Example*\nI have a macro for the padding top and bottom for desktop, tablet and mobile. In the coded template I predefined the padding settings for every module. This works and is visible on the page. When I change something, every padding is set to \"search\". So nothing is chosen, see the attached image. The module itself keeps the padding, but the options in the settings do not.  All the settings, who aren't macro's, keep their values.",
