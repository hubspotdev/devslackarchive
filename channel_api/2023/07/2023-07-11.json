Email sent to verify email\n3. Email verified on website\n4. *NEW:* HubSpot form in iFrame asking onboarding questions\n    a. Using a hidden Email field\n    b. Which is filled in using a Query parameter\n5. Dashboard overview\nThe HubSpot form requires an email. We discovered that the email validation rules from HubSpot are stricter than our own, beyond what is typically necessary. That means that in some cases, the email is going to be rejected. However, as the Email field is hidden, this means the user will be at a dead end because no error message is shown to them.\n\nHas anyone added a HubSpot form to their signup flow in the past? Are there other approaches that may work better?"
