    "text": "<@U38EZFVFE> sorry for the delay - haven't had a chance to play around with it. It looks like `require_js` deduplicates the call of the file (so if you are calling the jQuery CDN using that conditional listed above and you insert either that module several times on one page _or_ if that is called the same way on multiple different modules, it will only load once). Loading something via `require_js` and specifying `footer` should load that JS above your module JS files (the JS set in the module pane of your modules) and the attached JS files to your template. You can also specify `head` to load the JS in the header. More info here (<https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/hubl/functions#require-js>)."
