    "text": "Hello people :slightly_smiling_face: Happy Wednesday. My issue is the following. I created a custom module which is a button.\nSo i have a page template where i want to use the module a couple of times.\n\nThough i insert it 2 times in the template like that:\n```{% module \"module_16486536303886\" path=\"/Custom/custom_cta\", label=\"custom_cta\" %}```\nIn the editors page i can only edit the first instance.\n\nSo is there any way i can edit individually each of them?\n\nI attach some images to see how i did it:\n\nThank you very much",

    "text": "Looks like there are two things potentially going on.\n\nYour styles don’t look like they are scoped to the module instance so either reference `{{name}}` in your styles as a selector or wrap it all in `{%require_css%}&lt;style&gt;{%scope_css%}css{%end_scope_css%}&lt;/style&gt;{% end_require_css%}` \n\nThe other key is that you need to reference each module with a unique name\n\n```{% module \"module_16486536303886\" path=\"/Custom/custom_cta\", label=\"custom_cta\" %}```\nand\n```{% module \"unique_name_here\" path=\"/Custom/custom_cta\", label=\"custom_cta\" %}```\nWill allow this module to be editable in two unique places in the content editor."

  {
    "text": "Thank you very much BJ.\n\nThe second thing you mention was so obvious that i didt think about it. Tried it and now i can edit each button separately.\nThanks a lot for that :pray:\n\nWhat happens now is that whenever i change lets say the color of one it changes also the other.\n\nSo i followed the other advice you mentioned and i set id={{name}}\n\nAnd in my css i set it as selector and its working great\n\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH  :)",
