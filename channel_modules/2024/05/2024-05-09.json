I'm using the boilerplate: <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react/tree/main/examples/hello-world>.\nI've used i18n in several React projects before, but I'm having trouble with it here.\n\nI import '../i18n.js'; inside the layout.jsx file\" and within my component I call the import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'; But I get the error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')\n\nHas anyone experienced this before or can provide me with any tips/documentation explaining how this should be done?"
