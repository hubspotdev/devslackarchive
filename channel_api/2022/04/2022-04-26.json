We are using <http://tray.io|tray.io> to integrate our product with HubSpot (and other integrations) and there is a discrepancy between how the HubSpot docs say the search API works and what I can make work via tray.  Basically within the “filterGroups” payload, the api docs says to include a list of filters.  But when I use the Tray equivalent, in order to make it work I need to send\n```\"filter_groups\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"check_property_value\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"property_name\": \"HubSpot_owner_id\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"operator\": \"EQ\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"92983899\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t]```\nDoes anyone know if there is documentation for the “check_property_value” and other possible entries within filterGroups?  Is this perhaps an older API version and I need to switch to using raw HTTP requests to match the document? If anyone has encountered this or has a pointer to docs, I would really appreciate it.",
