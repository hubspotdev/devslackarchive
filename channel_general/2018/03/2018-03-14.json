I'd love to see Site Pages included for ALL customers as a base level (plus it would help drive adoption of the CMS or might be that last little push WordPress users need to migrate their site). Plus it puts HubSpot more directly in a position to compete with WordPress. WP is free other than the hosting. I look at it kind of the same way with HS. Have the CMS free because people are already paying for the \"hosting\" via their marketing subscription. Obviously HubSpot I'm sure has data that probably shows users of the CMS are generally more \"sticky\" just like those who get the CRM. Having HubDB as an add-on I think makes more sense then to have the entire website pages tool as the add-on. I'm a little hesitant to say that I think Content Staging should be a paid add-on. I don't think most non-developer/non-agency customers really understand the value of Content Staging (look how many years we had gone without it on HubSpot) and I can see a lot of them feeling like they can make do without it.\n\nThe wrinkle I'm sure that gets thrown into this is what do you do with the past idea I know has been floated about offering a standalone HubSpot CMS product."

So things like hubdb, shopify integration, smart content, a/b testing is for those bigger clients. From a partner standpoint these things can be sold later on when the need arrives or when we scope that it is needed. From a client coming to HS, I think the extra that is there isn't needed.  I also think HS could do better with A/B testing. A/B testing is okay if you have no idea what is going to work, but once you have something working an A/B test can kill conversions.  Say you have a nice converting page and you make a change, now you are putting your awesome converting page at risk by splitting that up in a 50/50 type arrangement.  This isn't the way we should be a/b testing in today's internet.  We should be doing something like 80% (somewhere in there) on the page that converts well, then compare the other 20% as the new page."
