    "text": "Hello guys,\nHubSpot support pointed me to this Slack group in regards to a question of mine, so I would really appreciate it. I'm really not a developer, but I need to build a solution for an urgent matter.\nOverview:\nWe are trying to send pricing emails to a big chunk of our database. In order to add customisation, we are using HubDB table. The limit of rows per HubDB table is 10 000 and we are planning to split the data in 6 batches - 6 tables  - 6 modules and 6 emails with a delay between the emails of at least 1 hour.\nIssue:\nI've built a table with 9999 rows and I've built a script for an email custom module, which uses the following code:\n```{% set hubdb_table = hubdb_table_rows(table_id=25505853) %}\n{% set matched_rows = hubdb_table | selectattr(\"Email\", \"equalto\", contact.email) %}\n\n{% if matched_rows %}\n    &lt;div style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #0c2340; margin-top: 20px; padding-left: 20px;\"&gt;\n        {% for row in matched_rows %}\n            &lt;div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"&gt;\n                &lt;h3 style=\"margin: 0; font-size: 16px;\"&gt;ID: {{ row[\"ID\"] }}&lt;/h3&gt;\n                &lt;ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;\"&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name with some additional text&lt;/strong&gt; {{ row[\"NAME\"] }}&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ID 2:&lt;/strong&gt; {{ row[\"ID_2\"] }}&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owner:&lt;/strong&gt; {{ row[\"OWNER\"] }}&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status:&lt;/strong&gt; {{ row[\"STATUS\"] }}&lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;/ul&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        {% endfor %}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n{% else %}\n&lt;p style=\"color: #0c2340; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; padding-left: 20px;\"&gt;No matching data found for this email.&lt;/p&gt;\n{% endif %}```\nthe name of the columns are test one, they are going to be replaced by other column names.\nThe issue is that when I do a preview with any contact after row 1000 I get a no found result.\nI've heard that there is a HubSpot limitation on the preview tool to preview up to 1000 rows, so I've added my email at the bottom - row 9999 and then I've sent myself an automated email which returned no found result.\n\nBased on the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/email/hubdb-crm-objects|HubSpot documentation> for programmable email, I can send to 100 000 recipients a programmable email if the number of HubL functions is 5. And my code has 5 functions. So, what and why is breaking?\n\nI would really appreciate if anyone can explain why this happens.\nThank you",

So the first thing that came to me was a \"child\" module :smile:\nBut I guess it's reasonable from the creator's perspective. It makes it harder to copy someone else's modules"
