This import is still in Beta version and I've searched online for resources how can I import multiple line items and associate them with a Deal but unfortunately I found nothing. Can you share any resources or maybe a sample sheet or any idea how can I achieve that. I am struck here. Any help will be of great value. Thanks in advance."
