    "text": "Are you looking to style the choice and boolean fields in the editor interface, or style how checkbox elements appear when a form is embedded on a page?\n\nI can tell you off top that the former isn’t possible — you’re not offered a ton of control over the editor interface.\n\nAs far as the latter goes, it’s actually pretty easy! Single checkbox form fields have a wrapper with the class `hs_single_checkbox`, and multi-checkbox form fields have a wrapper with the class `hs_multiple_checkboxes`. You can target those using CSS and style away. :~) Pretty much every type of form element has one of these wrappers, which makes styling HS forms more convenient than it might otherwise be.\n\nI hope I’ve understood correctly, and that you find this helpful!"
