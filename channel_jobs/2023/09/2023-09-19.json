    "text": "Hi all, further from my post a few months back, I’m super happy to share that I found a great pool of talents for HubSpot dev works and I started working with them already.\n\nHowever, today I have a specific need from client for a freelance HubSpot custom API dev, who could help me with troubleshooting API connection between HubSpot and Ms Dynamics, support us with coded workflow, or help us with webhook integration to send data to HubSpot, set up API between GCP and HubSpot for example.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who *operates within the EU* due to strict GDPR requirements from our clients. For this assignment, it will be task-based/ project-based.\n\nIf you are interested, drop me your details + your experience within this area.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and have a nice day!",
