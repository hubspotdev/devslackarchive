    "text": "I think it'd be pretty great if we got the option to create controls for preset styles in dnd_sections. For example: a dropdown that allows the author to select from preset theme color sets or standardized amounts of padding. Just something that lets me set custom classes on the dnd stuff depending on what the author selects. Preferably on the theme level.\nBasically, I've got a whole system for applying color palettes for different sections and the background color controls aren't really adequate for the same task. The DND stuff seems neat and I'd like to start using it, but this is kind of a frustrating limitation."
