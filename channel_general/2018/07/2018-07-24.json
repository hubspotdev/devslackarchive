We currently use it and wondered why when I click on a specific category (for instance just want to see all blog posts associated with “Growth Driven Design”) I’m also seeing the most current blog post like “Sales and Marketing Alignment”. Anyone know how to maneuver the template to only see the called out category? Has this been an issue for anyone with this template or elsewhere? Here is an example where we use it on our site <http://blog.dmagelimedia.com/blog/topic/growth-driven-design>",
