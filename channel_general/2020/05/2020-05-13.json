    "text": "Does anyone have a decent solution for adding a bit of horizontal padding to DND modules? The caveat being it needs to be semi-selective.\n\nI have a bunch of custom modules Pre DND that are still relevant and feature rich. A useful Full width image banner module with video capabilites for example.\n\nPlopping it into a DND module and getting the section to style so that its full width is easy enough. But When it comes to mobile Id like ~15px of padding around all of the modules’ text content while still retaining FW BG colors and images.\n\nI know I can target the .dnd-module class to add padding on mobile but that is global and then will result in squishing my BG image or video on a custom module.\n\nAny one run into this and figure something decent out?"
