    "text": "Hi everyone. :corgi-wave:\n\nI have just joined this platform and I'm not sure if this is the correct channel.\n\nSo this year we recently had a company rebranded and had our HubSpot templates changed by HubSpot to suit the new look.\n\nHowever, we have recently had an issue with the image alt text bringing up an error message with our blog posts. I spoke with HubSpot support, and they confirmed that the alt text is being applied. The error is coming from the img tag in the template:\n<https://app-eu1.HubSpot.com/design-manager/24975028/code/69259238850#L25>\n\nSo, it looks to be an issue because the featured image is also listed as a background image. See below where featured_image is listed twice:\n```&lt;div class=\"post-featured-image\" style=\"background-image:url('{{content.featured_image}}');\" aria-label=\"{% if content.featured_image_alt_text %}Featured image: {{ content.featured_image_alt_text }} - {% endif %}Read full post: {{ content.name|striptags }}\" alt=\"{{ content.featured_image_alt_text }}\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"{{content.featured_image}}\" style=\"visibility: hidden; max-width: 100%;\" aria-label=\"{% if content.featured_image_alt_text %}Featured image: {{ content.featured_image_alt_text }} - {% endif %}Read full post: {{ content.name|striptags }}\"&gt;```\nThe first listing \"style=\"background-image:url('{{content.featured_image}}');\" is where it is being flagged for not having alt text.\n\nThey recommend I consult with a developer to see if the first listing is cause for concern or if the error can be ignored. Additionally, I was told to reach out on this forum. Has anyone else had the same roadblock before?\n\nThanks,\nKind regards\nJenine",
