I know it's possible in the ui but <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/companies/how-do-i-merge-companies|manual merges> aren't an option.\nIf that's not possible is there a way to add additional domains to a company? It's common for an account to have multiple unique email domains and we'd like one company per account.",
