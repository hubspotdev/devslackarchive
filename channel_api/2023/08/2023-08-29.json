Specifically, I'm using the JetFormBuilder HubSpot Action plugin with the intention of establishing a ticketing system through HubSpot APIs. Despite my efforts, I've been unsuccessful in establishing a connection to the API. Over the past week, I've attempted various approaches, none of which have proven effective. To aid in troubleshooting, I've attached some screenshots here. Your assistance in finding a solution would be greatly appreciated.",
