    "text": "&gt; _\"Have you looked at improved bundling prices for CMS Enterprise with Marketing hub? There are alot of crossover features if you have CMS enterprise\"_\nThree thoughts on this one:\n• You can't host a website or web app on MH ... so if you need to build a digital experience (website, web app, event platform, etc), you need CMS Hub. \n• We are also adding many new CMS-only features (see roadmap). \n• There is already bundle discounting available + you can always try and negotiate with your sales rep :slightly_smiling_face: "

    "text": "&gt; _\"How far off are headless capabilities?\"_\nIn terms of launching a robust omnichannel / headless solution... no timeline. We're committed to doing it and are actively scoping/planning phase.\n\nBUT - The first step is decoupling the data layer from the presentation layer ... which is already underway and we're seeing some recent releass leveraging this (ex: Dynamic Pages and Page Content powered by CRM data). So depending on your use case, you _*might*_ be able to do what you need today.\n\nThis is one we're excited about, but we'll all need some patience as we want to do it right. If you have feedback/ideas - please ping me directly."
