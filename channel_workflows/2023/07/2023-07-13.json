    "text": "I am not sure how to share it, but it is actually really simple.  What I did was created a contact enrollment with properties for first name is known or last name is known or street address or city is known and then added an action of send a webhook to the workflow.  I made it a post type, added the url and did none for authentication type.  I tried some of the others, but could not get them to work and was not a priority.  I then set up the field to send instead of doing all.  I then set up my endpoint on my server.  I am using php.   I just accepted it and wrote it to directory to see what it sent.  I then ran the test in the setup and it worked.  I then turned it on and tried changing a contact,  but it did not work because I did not have re-enrollment turned on.  Once I turned it on, it worked as expected.  The issue that I had was when I added additional fields to the properties or (xxxx) is known.  I went and turned it off and on again and under re-enrollment there is an edit or detail area.  In there, you can do re-enrollemnt b field and all the new fields that I added were not checked.  I would think that should be the opposite by default.  Hope this helps."
