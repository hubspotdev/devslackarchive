    "text": "Hello\nI have a HubDB that contains information about a navigation and I need to populate a dictionary with it.\nEach row in the HubDB has up to 3 Levels (For example: General, Covid-19, xyz), with each level being in a different row.\nI can easily read those levels and print them out, but if multiple rows have the same 1st level (General), then it should only be displayed once.\n\nNow I wrote a code in HubL, which basically does exactly what I want. Or rather it should, because it just won't work properly as it should.\n```1: {% set navigation = {} %}\n2: {% set hubDB = hubdb_table_rows(module.hubdbtable_field) %}\n3: {% for row in hubDB %}\n4: {% if level1 not in navigation %}\n5: {% set level1 = row.level_1 %}\n6: {% do navigation.update({level1:\"awdaw\"}) %}\n7: {% endif %}\n8: {% endfor %}```\nIn line 5, I set a variable as the level string. And in line 6, I'm trying to update the dictionary with the level1 variable as its key.\nThe Issue is, instead of setting it as the value of the variable, it just saves it as \"level1\".\nAny idea on how to fix this so I can use a variable as a key?"

The name, link and feature image of the previous and next post is easily accessible by the use of blog variable. But is there any chance to get the description/content of the next and previous blog. I didn't get any suitable variable for that.\n\nI referred this document: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/variables#blog-variables>\n\nHoping the helping hand soon.\n\nThanks.",
