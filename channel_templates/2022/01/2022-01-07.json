    "text": "Hey everyone! Nice to meet you - I recently was tasked out with designing an email template in HubSpot. I'm used to creating editable templates for Campaign Monitor clients. I've been trying to go through the Developer resources in HubSpot and I'm stuck on what next steps and specific template language needs to go in the HTML and a few other things. Would anyone be willing to help me out? I'm at a standstill and feeling a little bit overwhelmed. For example - do we need to build modules within HubSpot and then copy the code over to the HTML editable template code? Or am I completely off?",
