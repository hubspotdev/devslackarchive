    "text": "Hey everyone! Could I get some help with getting a card to show up in the Record UI with UI Extensions? I have the files set up as outlined in \"Set up extension files\" <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/create-ui-extensions|here>. When I run 'hs project dev', I get two errors:\n\n[WARNING] Unable to determine if your extension entry point is calling HubSpot.extend, this may prevent it from rendering as expected.\n\nand\n\n[WARNING] Couldn't find the following components in the deployed build for this project: '[UI Extension] Battlecard'. This may cause issues in local development.\n\nBecause of this, no card is showing up in the record's UI Extension. The src/app folder in the github repo can be found <https://github.com/megswen/battlecards/tree/practice-testing-megan/lift-battlecards/src/app|here>. Any help is appreciated!"
