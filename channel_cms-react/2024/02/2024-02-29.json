Actually in prod I see no issues anymore (I am sure it was there before as well).\nThe problem in my case persists on localhost, not a huge probably but nice to have no duplication maybe? :slightly_smiling_face:\nDo you know / have a plan to handle the dev-server duplication as well?"

    "text": "&gt;  Do you know / have a plan to handle the dev-server duplication as well?\nAt the moment, no. It certainly would be nice to make dev more indicative of the prod environment. But I know of several of the tradeoffs Vite chooses (in terms of local development speed and flexibility) make this harder. And looking deeper into current Vite issues, I see <https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/16018> … and that looks like it would solve this issue :crossed_fingers:"
