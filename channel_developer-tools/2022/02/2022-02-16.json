    "text": "Hi all. Not sure if this is the right channel to ask, but here it goes. I am in the process of finalizing a pipeline on gitlab for our HubSpot code. I am getting stuck in the upload phase where it says the follow error:\n`[ERROR] A RequestError has occurred. Error: tunneling socket could not be established, statusCode=403`\nI am not sure why this is happening. I have also set up a test account on github and have created a manual configuration for the pipeline, similar to what i have on gitlab, to test it out from there. From  github it worked flawlessly. But not on gitlab.\nDoes anyone know what the issue could be?"
