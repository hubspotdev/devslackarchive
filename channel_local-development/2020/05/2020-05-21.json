    "text": "Morning! We currently have a one way sync setup for our local development. Do we have to fetch modules we created locally? I see we do not have the ID in the `meta.json` if we do not fetch the module. And I am wondering if this has any downsides. We do have some issues with global content being overwritten when uploading to the portal. Could it be that we are missing the right content in the `meta.json` or do we need to fetch the `fields.json` as well? And does anyone know what the purpose is of the `_locales` folder when fetching?",
