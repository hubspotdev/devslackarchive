    "text": "Hello everyone,\nI saw that oEmbed is available so this gave me a nice idea of using it in emails, i send images of products with short descriptions that link to my website. So idea was to just implement oembed on my website add a custom module with oembed and just put the link to my website and show image link, title and description; First i started to experiment using flickr as oembed source, now i finished implemnting oembed on my website but my link don't work. i just get a 404. but implementation is done just as on flickr;\nIs oembed restricted to specific websites?"
