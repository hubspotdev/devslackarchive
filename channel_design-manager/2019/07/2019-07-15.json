Trying to recover an auto-save state prior to a save/update of a page.\nbasically what happened: client was editing pages, assuming a revision is maintained to go back to at any point. I ran a script that hit the `Update a Page` endpoint to fix some broken modules not showing in the editor.\nHowever, unknown to either of us was that the auto-save does not actually create a revision (nor does it reflect the most current content on the `Get a Page` endpoint, using the most current saved revision instead from some internal testing...).\nSo, my `Update` API call created a new revision point, wiping out the auto-saved content.\nAny chance it can be recovered? Already put in a support ticket, but hopeful someone might have a solution."
