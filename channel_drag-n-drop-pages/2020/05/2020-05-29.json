    "text": "Quick clarifying question/suggestion. It is my understanding that there is no way to add \"style options\" to custom modules that can be adjusted in DND pages, is that correct? If so, could it be possible to either not have this tab show for custom modules, or at least adjust the copy in the tooltip to something akin to \"Style options are only available for HubSpot default modules?\" The current UI and copy suggests that developers did not add in style functionality out of neglect, rather than this being a HubSpot limitation.",
