    "text": "Hey team.\nIs there any way to access LocalStorage or something similar?\nWe have quite a few situations where we want to e.g. display something the first time a user uses a certain card (until they click x) — or we want to keep a log of updates and only show them a little red dot if something is new. And the only way I can see that we can build that now would to put it in a database (e.g. HubDb) and call it through Serverless every time the card loads, which seems ineffective and not a great use of our RateLimits. Is there an alternative?",

I have the startup project working to the point of connecting to the backend and returning data to the card.\n\nMy question right now is can I (and maybe more to the point, should I) create one backend for a collection of related App Cards I want to create.  It seems that since I receive the data knowing the user, portal and app IDs I certainly could.  But I am wondering best practices here.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.",
