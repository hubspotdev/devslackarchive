    "text": "<@U07DBU750P7>, as <@U03AKL6Q1B2> said, technically you can't.\nBut...\nI needed this as well, so I came up with a custom solution with CSS and JS.\nBasically, I hid that `.hs-membership-global-message` element with CSS, then added a check at DOMContentLoaded event to the URL query string for the \"reset_success\" parameter (which shows up when you submit the form and the page reloads). If it's present, then I change that element's text content and finally display it (so that you don't see any flickering effect in changing the text)."

    "text": "First time question: I have a few custom modules where in the meta.json I previously had \"content_types\" : [ \"SITE_PAGE\" ]. After noticing that the module was not available to be used on Landing Page types, I updated the meta.json for these widgets to use \"content_types\" : [ \"SITE_PAGE\", \"LANDING_PAGE\" ]. The modules still aren't available for selection on landing pages however. I can see in the design manager that Landing Pages are selected as a supported content type. Is there anything I'm missing, or is this something you generally can't change after the module has initially been created? The module is available and works perfectly fine on site pages.",
