    "text": "When a user fills out a HubSpot form on the website, I need to display a message that contains their local distributor information based on the country they selected in the form. There are no \"smart\" options for the thank you message on the page or the Follow Up email.  I was thinking of redirecting the user to another page, but how do I access the form data to be able to read the country they submitted and be able to display the proper information? For the follow-up email I believe I will need to:\n• Create active regional lists based on the country provided\n• Create an email that uses smart content based on the regional lists\n• Set up a workflow to send out the email (will it be able to send out the right message if it is kicked off from a workflow or do I need to create separate emails?)\nIs there a better way to handle this? It seems like an awful lot of steps for something that should be basic",
