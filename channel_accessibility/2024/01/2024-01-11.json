    "text": "Party foul: the (relatively) new Image Grid default module disables the focus ring for selectable elements inside of it. The source of this seems to be the use of an overly-aggressive `all: unset` button reset hiding the module’s default focus ring styles, as well as any styles from the parent stylesheet. There’s also an `overflow: hidden` on the containing `&lt;li&gt;` element, which *also* hides the focus ring, once it’s been restored.\n\nIdeally, I’d prefer that default modules not mess with my focus ring styling at all — it’s a pain to have to override these sorts of things on a case-by-case basis.",
