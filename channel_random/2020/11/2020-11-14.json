    "text": "Hi guys :wave:!\n\nWe recently launched <https://usebrunch.com/|Brunch>, an app that brings designers, developers, copyrighters, clients, and all your team together. With Brunch, it’s easy to get feedback on a website you just created. No need for long calls to explain where that text should be different or where is that extra pixel you didn’t notice in design. People can use Brunch to show you exactly what they want and where they want it. It’s a sort of pointing a finger at it, but socially acceptable.\n\nThe app has a FREE plan but you guys, we give you two months free coupon on our Business plan to fully test the app: <https://bit.ly/32ImMUf>\n\nCheck out <https://youtu.be/Qlu8kJEH7Jk|this video> for a quick demo of the app.\n\nYou can write to us at <mailto:support@usebrunch.com|support@usebrunch.com> for any questions, feedback, or if you want to schedule a call."
