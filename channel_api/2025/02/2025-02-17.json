    "text": "Hey Collin, thanks for the response — the reasoning seems valid.\n\n I just wanted to confirm and ask you to correct me if I'm wrong.\nTo use the Private App authentication mechanism, what I'm doing is creating a public app, adding all the required scopes, then installing it in my (domain-based) account, and subsequently using the access token for the API calls (which aligns more with the Client Credentials-based authentication mentioned in the Private App auth).\nThe issue I encountered, as mentioned in my previous message, is related to the scopes.\nIs this the correct way of using Private App authentication in this case, or is there another approach I should be considering?\ncouldn't find proper docs way of using private app mechanism in this case since in custom channels documentation it says create public app initially (shown in second screenshot)\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/api/conversations/create-custom-channels#create-a-public-app>\n\nprivate app access token link docs: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/apps/authentication/intro-to-auth#private-app-access-tokens>\n\nThanks in advance!",

the request for 20 minutes: \n```{\n    \"outputFields\": {\n        \"hs_execution_state\": \"BLOCK\",\n        \"hs_expiration_duration\": \"PT20M\"\n    }\n}```\n• We save the process in a queue and process it asynchronously.\n• Once the request is processed we return a callback via `POST`  - `<https://api.hubapi.com/automation/v4/actions/callbacks/complete>`\nIf successful we call the endpoint without a body (for the moment), although you can include outputFields.\nIf an error occurs:\n```{\n    \"outputFields\": {\n        \"hs_execution_state\":\"FAIL_CONTINUE\",\n        \"errorCode\":\"NOT_SUPPORTED\"\n    }\n}```\nI hope I haven't left anything out and if so I will be happy to help solve any related questions as much as I can. Thank you all very much :love-parrot:"

HubSpot appears to only allow you to use _OAuth_ for public apps and _Access tokens_ for Private apps (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/apps/authentication/intro-to-auth>) So maybe this is why the scope error is showing up? (I'm happy to be wrong here too. Maybe someone else knows more about authentication than I do). You shouldn't need to create a public app to support a private app, or vice-versa. They should be independent."

What I have for notes on 500 errors from HubSpot is this:\n• Usually resolved by waiting.\n• HubSpot could be temporarily overloaded or unavailable.\n• Set time delays between 500 errors and future calls (This is if you have a chain of API calls that you are planning on executing).\nThe response from HubSpot is probably a server reboot and maybe adding additional code to account for a request they weren't prepared for (which probably caused the crash in the first place). Unfortunately for you, this means they'll be down until they restart the server. We experienced a similar issue with v2 DELETE calls for Workflow APIs last week.\n\nHopefully this helps!"

Example:\n```Company name => name```\nYou can find these internal property names by clicking the Object name -> Actions -> Edit Properties -> Click property you want to see. Example:\n\n```Companies -> Actions -> Edit Properties -> Company Name```\nAnd in this case you'll see that the internal value for \"Company Name\" is actually \"name\".\n\nThis is really cumbersome to track all of these values down, so<@U04CC57CMBP> built a really useful app to show HubSpot's internal property names for the main four Core HubSpot Objects.\n<https://hs-default-properties.replit.app>"
