Chrome, Firefox, and even Microsoft Edge seem to handle it really nice.  The Safari browser, not so much and I get a quick flash of un-styled content.\n\nAnyone else have similar issues?\ncc: <@U7SL518D6>",

    "text": "I can’t say I’m seeing any issues with it really. It’s working as I’d expect it to.\n\nMy personal site loads almost all of the CSS async.\n<https://www.jonmclaren.dev>\n\nDo understand though when you load CSS async you are telling the browser it doesn’t need that CSS to be loaded before starting to render the page. Then what happens is the javascript adds the link tag in. That results in the CSS file getting loaded. So the browser then needs to paint and relayout any changes.\n\nSo I’d advise not asyncing everything.\n\nIn my site’s case the design is extremely minimal so I implemented critical CSS, which makes it so my site can load extremely fast and the first paint of the page will have most of the layout and the left sidebar rendered correctly."
