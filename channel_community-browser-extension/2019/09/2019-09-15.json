    "text": "hmm chrome extension required more permissions. I will see about reducing this for now. Was not intending for that to happen. Will take me a little bit to remove that permission request. This was related to a feature we disabled as that feature is not stable. Long term we hope to make the permission request optional. It will limit some functionality but itâ€™s better to ask for smaller permissions.\n\nwill try to get the permissions patch out this week."
