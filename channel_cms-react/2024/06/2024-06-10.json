So the usage of hooks would need to be inside an `Island.` I think people now are a bit over exaggerating the need of putting everything Server side. For years they have all been shipping JS bundles to the client without any issues (for regular marketing website)"

Is there more information in the console on the server-side error (like  `Error when server rendering…`)?\n\n• Right now we do not offer a way to suppress that error message, because it does indicate a significant problem*\n• If the problem goes away with `clientOnly` it likely means that there is some code in that island that is assuming a browser API/global is available and triggering the error\n• Can you replicate the problem locally via dev server proxying? (And if so, what errors do you see in the terminal?)\n*: … though we should probably have some kind of `fallback={…}` or `ErrorComponent={…}` prop to an island to customize failure cases."

    "text": "Hi perhaps I can find some help here :slightly_smiling_face:\nI have just released my new island and it's the first time I am trying to work with island and graphql.\nEverything works like a charm locally, the graphql query gets resolved perfectly with database data from the portalId of my config file, which is amazing.\nHowever, after deploy, I drag my island to a page and nothing gets rendered. The only thing I can see when looking at the DOM is the following inside the island wrapper:\n`&lt;!-- Error rendering module tag: dataQueryResult value --&gt;`\n\nCode simplify is something like this:\n```import { Island } from '@HubSpot/cms-components';\nimport MyIsland from '../../islands/MyIsland/MyIsland.jsx?island';\n\nconst dataQuery = `{  \n  HUBDB {\n    collection_one() {\n      items {\n        stuff\n      }\n    }\n    collection_two() {\n      items {\n        stuff\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}`;\n\nexport const Component = (props) =&gt; {\n  const {\n    dataQueryResult: {\n      data: {\n        HUBDB: {\n          collection_one: { items: itemsOne },\n          collection_two: { items: itemsTwo },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    fieldValues,\n  } = props;\n \n  return (\n    &lt;Layout&gt;\n      &lt;Island\n        module={MyIsland}\n        hydrateOn='load'\n        data={{itemsOne,itemsTwo}}\n        fieldValues={fieldValues}\n      /&gt;\n    &lt;/Layout&gt;\n  );\n};\n\nexport const meta = {\n  label: `MyIsland JS`,\n};\nexport { fields } from './fields.jsx';\nexport const query = dataQuery; ```\nThank you :slightly_smiling_face:",
