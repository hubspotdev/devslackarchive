    "text": "What's up all my brilliant HubSpot CMS Dev folks - Have a tricky question I'm trying to figure out... not sure it's possible... but wanted to ask. \n\nI have a phone app side project - and in order to do deep linking into the app, I have to host a JSON file in this exact path: <https://www.keyy.io/students/assetlinks.json>\n\nThe problem is that when uploading the json file into the file manager, it includes an extra folder \"/hubfs/\" and places the file here: <https://www.keyy.io/hubfs/students/assetlinks.json> ... unfortunately I don't believe Google allows this extra folder path for their deep linking. \n\nAnyone know a way to add the file in this exact file path: <https://www.keyy.io/students/assetlinks.json> ??",
