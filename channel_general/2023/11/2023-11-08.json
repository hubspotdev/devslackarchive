    "text": "Hello Community, I need your help and support. It turns out that we migrated the website previously hosted on AWS to HubSpot. Within this migration we do not correctly consider the redirects and we are presenting problems with 404 errors. It turns out that our website <https://mydomain.com/payments/id_dynamic>, had to rewrite with a 301 to <https://mydomain2.com> /id_dynamic.\n\nHow do I adjust the path and dynamic parameters in the domains/url-redirects functionality of the website?\n\nThank you very much in advance if you have had a similar experience and how you have resolved it.",

There must be some process for capturing the access and session tokens after a successful authentication?"
