Is it possible to add an attachment directly to a contact (under the attachments section) *without creating an engagement* (like a Note)?\n2. If so, can the source of the attachment be customized to reflect my company’s name instead of a default or generic label?\n3. If We can not upload attachment without *engagement*, is there a way to customize the source to a custom source like my company name.\nI’d appreciate any guidance or documentation that can help with this use case.\nThanks in advance!",
