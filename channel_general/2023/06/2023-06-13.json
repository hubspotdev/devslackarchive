For each piece of text you want to make into a link you could replace the text with a version that has an anchor link wrapped around it.\n\nProbably the best way though, get the content across all those pages via API. find and replace all the instances of the words in your code editor, use the pages API to update all the pages with the changes, That way the changes are in the content and don’t confuse content creators."
