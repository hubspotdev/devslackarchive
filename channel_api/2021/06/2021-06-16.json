So cool!\",\n      \"actionCardContent\": \"Create widget {{widgetName}}\",\n      \"inputFieldLabels\": {\n        \"widgetName\": \"Widget Name\",\n        \"widgetOwner\": \"Widget Owner\"\n      },\n      \"inputFieldDescriptions\": {\n        \"widgetName\": \"Enter the full widget name.

It has info in the layout_sections and sections parameters, but nothing in widgets or widgetcontainers. I know you mentioned earlier that it will only show up in widgets if the ‘module’ has been changed from the default, so I guess I am confused on what exactly a ‘module’ is, since I did change several parts of the page. Thanks in advance"

So, to clarify, just changing the text/links would not effect the module itself, as it is just updating the content on one module instance, and the Module itself is the structure used for that part of the page. And if I want the API to return widgets I need to customize the module’s structure. Is all of that correct?"
