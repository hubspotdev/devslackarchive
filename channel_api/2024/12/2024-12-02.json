For example, in the attached screenshot, I’ve highlighted one user and specified their permissions as follows:\n• *View:* All companies\n• *Edit:* Their team’s companies\n• *Delete:* None\nI’d like to retrieve these permissions via the API. Is there a way to accomplish this?\n\nwe are using <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/api/settings/users/user-provisioning#get-%2Fsettings%2Fv3%2Fusers%2Froles> for our reference but we got no necessary details.",
