Please refer to our code of conduct on for more information: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/slack/code-of-conduct#channel-spamming>\n\nFor now I am going to remove your post in other channels and keep this one here in General for folks to respond to. If you ever have questions on the best place to ask your question, please feel free to post in <#C22PU4LV8|general> and folks in the slack can provide direction for you."
