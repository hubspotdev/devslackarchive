Or are you limited to the templates by HubSpot?\n- Are you restricted from writing your own custom CSS? What if you want to make some fine tuned adjustments?\n- Would developers ever be able to create templates?\n- Will this functionality phase out the current email system and templates? Or will this work in tandem with the current way of creating coded email templates (the user experience of building emails is different)?"
