It ends up in /Users/&lt;me&gt;/HubSpot.config.yaml. Is this correct? The docs say, \"Once you've completed this simple init flow, you'll see a success message confirming that a configuration file, HubSpot.config.yml, has been created *in your current directory.*\"",

It is fine for the file to be there, the important part is that the config file is either in the current directory or a parent directory of the current directory. If you prefer to put it in the current directory you may move it, but you dont need to, it will work either way.\n\nSorry for the confusion."
