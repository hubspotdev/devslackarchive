We <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/workflows/custom-code-actions|moved the boiler plate code into the documentation> instead so you can still pop in there and copy paste.\n\nHow important is it for you to have the boilerplate code default on the custom code action vs having to go to the documentation for it?"
