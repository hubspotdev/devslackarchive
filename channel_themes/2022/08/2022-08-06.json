But when I have a webpage using one theme, and try to use a module from the second theme, not all the features are available. *Is there an easy way to fix this so I can seamlessly use modules from different themes regardless of the current page’s theme?*\n2. I tried to create a child theme for one of my purchased Themeforest themes, and I keep getting an error that says “Cannot create more child themes” - *how do I fix this?* How important is it to create a child theme when customizing my website?\nTHANK YOU for your help!",
