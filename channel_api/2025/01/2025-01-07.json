I see the <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/properties/HubSpots-default-deal-properties|default deal properties page> , but it only gives a handful of property names in the example code. I can see properties on that page like \"Amount\" which translates to \"amount\" in the JSON object, but if I want to get the \"Deal Owner\" property, what JSON key name do I use? It clearly isn't \"owner\" based on my query results from an API call. Can anyone help me out with this?",
