I have noticed that if one of the IDs is invalid (meaning there is no object with that id) the batch succeeds with informative response if any error occurred. Note that the other updates, those with the valid IDs, are updated successfully which is great. Relying on that behavior I can filter invalid data and handle them according to my needs. However, when I send in the batch a property that doesn’t exist (meaning this field was not created in HubSpot), the WHOLE batch fails. My question is how if there is a similar approach for invalid property, as it is with the invalid HubSpot id.\nthanks!\nIm attaching example of the 2 cases:",
