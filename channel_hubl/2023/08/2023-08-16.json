    "text": "if you print out products2.results.hs_object_id, you won’t see anything because it isn’t an element in your results array. What you have would only be valid if results was an object, e.g. {results: {hs_object_id: 1}}.  To accomplish what it looks like you’re trying to, you could try something along the lines of:\n\n```{% if products2.results|map(\"hs_object_id\") is containing product.hs_object_id %}```\nThis will give you an array of all of the hs_object_id values in the objects of your results array. Which you can then use to check your product.hs_object_id against.\n\nUsing a piece of the example Evelynn provided would work too, and would arguably be a bit more concise:\n\n```{% if products2.results|selectattr(\"hs_object_id\", \"equalto\", product.hs_object_id) %}```\n"

    "text": "We've done it both ways... one where the megamenu is built dynamically based on the HubSpot menu and it's parent/child structure. That is good, but we've more often built it where it was a separate custom module. In the module, there's a repeater for the main level menu, then within each one, there are options and child fields. We have a free theme in Marketplace that has a megamenu module that you could check out:\n<https://ecosystem.HubSpot.com/marketplace/website/fusion-theme-by-new-era-technology>"
