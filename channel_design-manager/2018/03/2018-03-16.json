One of our portals, we are working on, sometimes I go in there and asks me again if we want to use the new design manager or not.  Since I've converted some modules for the new manager, I didn't want other users using the old manager."

If you disable it however I think everyone sees the old one again. Like 1 sitewide lightswitch that anyone with design manager access can flip on or off. That’s how it appears to work."

Especially in the new Design Manager, it seems the only way to get to these is by going to Website Pages, clicking more tools, and then choosing one of those. I switch between design manager, content staging, and hubdb fairly frequently. At least please put those links back in a menu on the Design manager",
