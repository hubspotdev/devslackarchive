It seems depending on how much you click around the site before you purchase affects what percentage of revenue gets attributed to an email. Basically all we want to do is have a way to see how many people clicked through through an email and what deals can be attributed to it.\n I dont think we are the only company that is B2C that uses HubSpot and would like to know how much revenue is being created by an email / email campaign"
