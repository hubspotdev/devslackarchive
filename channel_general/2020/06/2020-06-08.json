    "text": "Hi! I’m struggling with HubSpot CMS CLI – we’ve been uploading some static pages to a path `portals/123098-xxxx/content/files/homepage-new` but now it seems like i cannot access that directory anymore – CMS CLI allows me only to preview files of the HubSpot page and modules :cry: Is there any way to check the folders structure in CMS CLI (except fetching `/` ). How can i access the `portals/123098-xxxx/content/files/homepage-new`  directory? From my perspective CMS CLI gives me access to `123098-xxxx` but when i’m trying to fetch `content` for example it throws an error that it doesn’t exist :disappointed:",
