(2018 HubSpot Global Partner of the Year) is currently looking to add another member to our web development team. This is a full-time remote position (we are a 100% remote agency) working primarily with the HubSpot CMS.\n\nI started with SmartBug earlier this year, and it's been an incredible experience to work with talented team members from across North America on national and international client accounts all from my home office or a coffee shop.\n\n<https://smartbugmedia.applytojob.com/apply/4R8hAscBtN/FrontEnd-HubSpot-Developer-Remote?referrer=20191219171251RF69Z9HIIOJ7TBI3>\n\nWe love the dev slack and would love for our next team member to be a part of this community. If you have any questions about the position or SmartBug, feel free to shoot me a DM and I'd be happy to help however I can."
