In the real estate example (which I probably have memorized by now), there’s just an array of `[1,2,3,4]`, which is great if that’s all you’re ever going to have. I may add more values to my foreign ID table, and would love for the filter to automatically update when that happens. I’m pulling these in as options on a dropdown, so I think this is just a question of syntax",
