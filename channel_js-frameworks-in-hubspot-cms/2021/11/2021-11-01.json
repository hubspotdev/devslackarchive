    "text": "I built a postcss-hubl syntax (parser, tokenizer, stringifier) to so that postcss can understand hubl expressions and statements. This works fine with postcss on its own. However, when bundled with Webpack using postcss-loader &gt; css-loader &gt; miniCssExtractPlugin I see that postcss is run twice. the first time its run using my syntax. The second time using the native postcss syntax.\n\nAny thoughts on how I can force CSS-loader to use my postcss syntax? I wrote out a big post on stach-overflow that goes into a bit more detail.\n\n<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69800524/css-loader-isnt-utilizing-postcss-loader-postcss-syntax>\n\nWould love if anyone had any insight on where im either going wrong or where I need to look."
