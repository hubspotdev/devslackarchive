    "text": "Google recently announced major changes are coming to page ranking that factor in page experience, some of which the HubSpot CMS doesn't handle well. For example, since Google started showing *Core Web Vitals* in the Google Search Console, a very large number of our pages created with the CMS are rated as poor for *Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)*. I suspect this is going to have a big impact on our SERPs once this change goes into effect.\n\nDoes HubSpot have developers that specifically monitor Google changes for SEO and are there plans to change the underlying CMS to deliver a better page experience for pages created with it and hosted by HubSpot?\nHere's a few links for reference:\n• <https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html>\n• <https://web.dev/vitals/>\n• <https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272543/google-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp>",
