We are running a student team and another brand, and I really need help to pay someone to make sure our email workflows are running properly between HubSpot and Shopify. I can't really find experts on Fiverr. Thank you so much!",

    "text": "Hey everyone, I designed a simple module to pull information from the line item table to be used in emails.. the `email_each` fuction didn't work for our use case as we needed the ability to sort the records by product name and we couldn't get it to sort with `email_each`.\nThe module I put together was working while testing and we were about to implement it, however is suddenly returning nothing and showing up blank in emails... Really scratching my head over this one and hope someone can help! :pray::skin-tone-2:\nCode I used is below - any thoughts on why this might be happening?\n```{% set email_list =deal.line_items %}\n  {% for item in email_list|sort(false, false, 'name') %}\n&lt;b&gt;Workshop Date and Time(s):&lt;/b&gt; {{item.workshop_date}} - {{item.start_time_s_}}&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Number of Workshops:&lt;/b&gt; {{item.quantity}} x {{item.delivery_method}}&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Module:&lt;/b&gt; {{item.business}} - {{item.name}}&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Year Level:&lt;/b&gt; {{item.year_level}} - {{item.no__participants}} participants&lt;br&gt;\n{% endfor %}```",
