    "text": "Hey All - working with a customer and they had these questions when it regards to smart content and personalization:\n\n• We have a sub-set of users that will need to be shown specific (local) content but for the most part, their content needs will be similar to all other users - they should be able to use smart content here. \n• Can we use Smart Content rules in the main website header to display additional local content to specific users (known and anonymous)? - this is the one I am not sure of and looks like it is not possible?\n• Can we create a subfolder that or subdomain that leverages global content from another website? - Not sure here either.\nAny guidance would be extremely helpful!"
