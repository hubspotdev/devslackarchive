I’ve created one on our developers account, and created auth link with redirection page. When I’m using this link, just after selecting account on which I would like to install app, I’m almost immediately redirected to page specified in link settings. I cannot authorise account to use application.\n\nHave anyone faced such issue?",

This app should have the capability to manipulate and handle CMS data. Thus far, my exploration has revealed that Public App integrations are primarily geared towards CRM functionalities.
