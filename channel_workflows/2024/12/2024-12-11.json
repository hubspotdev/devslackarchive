    "text": "Hi <@U079QHR5345> :wave:\n\nHere's a quick example written in Python:\n```import HubSpot\nfrom HubSpot.crm.contacts import ApiException\nimport os\nhs_pat = os.environ[\"YOUR_SECRET_NAME\"]\n\ndef main(event):\n  client = HubSpot.Client.create(access_token=hs_pat)\n  latest_value = \"\"\n  try:\n    api_response = client.crm.contacts.basic_api.get_by_id(contact_id=event[\"object\"][\"objectId\"], properties_with_history=[\"test_3\"], archived=False)\n    \n    if len(api_response.to_dict()[\"properties_with_history\"][\"test_3\"]) == 1:\n      # test_3 has been set exactly 1 time\n      latest_value = api_response.to_dict()[\"properties_with_history\"][\"test_3\"][0].to_dict()[\"value\"]\n      \n    elif len(api_response.to_dict()[\"properties_with_history\"][\"test_3\"]) &gt; 1:\n      # test_3 has been set more than 1 time\n      # compare the 2 most recent changes only\n      current_values = api_response.to_dict()[\"properties_with_history\"][\"test_3\"][0].to_dict()[\"value\"].split(\";\")\n      previous_values = api_response.to_dict()[\"properties_with_history\"][\"test_3\"][1].to_dict()[\"value\"].split(\";\")\n      newly_added_values = []\n      for value in current_values:\n        if value not in previous_values:\n          newly_added_values.append(value)\n      latest_value = \";\".join(newly_added_values)\n    else:\n      # test_3 has never been set\n      pass\n    \n  except ApiException as e:\n    print(\"Exception when calling basic_api-&gt;get_by_id: %s\\n\" % e)\n  \n  # Return the output data that can be used in later actions in your workflow.\n  return {\n    \"outputFields\": {\n      \"latest_value\": latest_value\n    }\n  }```\nYou'd just need to configure a custom code action \"secret\" with your Private App access token and then update the \"YOUR_SECRET_NAME\" in the hs_pat variable declaration. This won't be perfect, but it should cover the example case you've described pretty well. Please also note, the code I've shared doesn't set the property value for \"latest_campaign_tag_hs_test\" -- it simply makes the \"latest_value\" available as an action output. You could use this action output to set the property value via a CRM &gt; \"Edit record\" workflow action. Hope this helps :)"
