    "text": "Hi <@U07DB91P073>, since you are receiving normal push notifications in your app, it indeed seems issue with the HubSpot setup. At the moment with the information I have, I can only think off the following reasons behind it not working:\n\n1. Firebase Cloud Messaging API (v1) is not enabled for your Firebase project (Though this seems unlikely, but still no harm in checking that)\n2. The HubSpot backend is probably not configured correctly with the relevant details from your firebase project. \n3. The device token is not properly uploaded in the HubSpot backend. This can happen, if you have inherited the `HubSpotFirebaseMessagingService` and also overriding the `onNewToken()` callback but not calling `super.onNewToken()` inside it.\nCan you check these please?"
