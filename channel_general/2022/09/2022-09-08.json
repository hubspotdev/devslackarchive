    "text": "<@U034X9K26MD> good day. I hope you are doing well. I have a quick question for you. I am resuming development that uses the automation API ‘/automation/v4/actions/.’ I implemented your advice from our prior conversation and is now able to communicate with the endpoints using oAuth accessToken. Now, i ran into a new problem. When i try reading or writing to that endpoint, i get the error “The account ID provided (#######) isn’t valid. Make sure that account has installed your app before making this call.” The account ID it is referring to, is the one belonging to the developer account. The accessToken i am using was generated when i linked the app to a production account. Any idea?"
