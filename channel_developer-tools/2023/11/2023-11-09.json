    "text": "Hello All, how many of you use TypeScript with your HubSpot projects?\n\nHave you had the desire/need for TypeScript type definitions specifically generated for your HubSpot portal schema? ie, Type definitions that reflect all your custom objects, fields and relationships?\n\nAs our codebase has grown, these are things that seem like they will become more important and useful. \n\nI haven’t seen any tools that currently do this and was hoping to see if anyone else had any ideas. \n\nI hacked together a proof of concept codegen tool that spits out type definitions for all objects and relationships for a given portal but wasn’t sure if there was something already built and if not, would such a tool be useful for the broader community. \n\nI would love some feedback.
