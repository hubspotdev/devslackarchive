We create the property (either through API or web) and the internal_name now becomes “n2_property” and we wouldn’t have known about the auto renaming when we’re preparing our existing parameters and it gives out error for every one of our set of properties when we try to automate our API calls.\n\nIt would help to have known if about the internal name renaming ahead before we create all of the relevant properties."
