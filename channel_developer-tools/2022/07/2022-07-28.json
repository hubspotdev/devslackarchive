    "text": "Good afternoon! I am working on an HubSpot Theme. I made some changes to templates and modules. I published some wrong updates to “base.html” , so now I want to go back to the previous version of that file. If I try to right-click on “base.html” and click “Show revision history” on the popup, this error appears: “Woops. There was a problem loading the revision for ‘base.html’.“.\nHad It ever happened to you?\nDo you know any way to solve this problem?\n\nThank if you will answer!",
