I change the option using JS in `onFormReady` event and it works - the country changes. I also dispatch a `change` event to trigger all other necessary functions and it works (I console logged 'change' when the event happens) but the country code doesn't change. Country in select field changes, change event fires but the country code in the actual phone input doesn't get updated. Is there anything else I have to do or event to fire to make it work?",

We’d really appreciate it if you could install the app and try it out. Here’s the installation link: <https://app-eu1.HubSpot.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=5a2fa736-46aa-4b61-902b-a0cbc9507806&amp;redirect_uri=https://callscriptprompter.com/HubSpot/install.html&amp;scope=crm.objects.contacts.write%20oauth%20crm.objects.owners.read%20crm.objects.companies.write%20crm.objects.companies.read%20crm.objects.deals.read%20crm.objects.deals.write%20crm.objects.contacts.read|LINK TO INSTALL APP> .\nThe app requires the following scopes:\n• Account information (so we can identify the user);\n• Contact, company, and deal data (read and write) to import and insert fields into the scripts, as well as update record details.\nAfter installing, you’ll be redirected to the app page, where you’ll need to either log in or create a new account in Call Script Prompter.\nThanks in advance for your help! :heart: Feel free to reach out if you have any questions."
