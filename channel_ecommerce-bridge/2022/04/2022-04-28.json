    "text": "Hi everyone I'm Miguel from HubSnacks. I'm researching a potential integration with HubSpot and Woocommerce and getting up to speed with Ecommerce Bridge. Api seems great but I have a question - if I generate a sale on Woocommerce via an ad (say FB or Google), and sync this sale to HubSpot, will I be able to attribute this sale to advertising in HubSpot. I cannot see anything in the EB documentation that refers to tracking ad spend. Any insights will be really appreciated! Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:",
