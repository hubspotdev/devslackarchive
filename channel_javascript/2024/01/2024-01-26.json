    "text": "Hi <@U03FJQPSC0Y>!\n\n1. `passing session to the app` -- with salesforce you can build integrated apps (that live outside of sfdc and lighting) and \"continue\" an authenticated session with a token passed through the url, essentially an access_token, but I dont know if that is what they formally pass.  That session ID can then be used to authenticate the API client, and all calls are made by the client from that user (and their relative permissions).  I think they call it embedded login, but I'm not sure to be honest, its been a while since I used it.\n2. By public, I mean accessible to the world, and the nature of the request is that we are trying to make it as smooth as possible for the sales/marketing users in HubSpot with a seamless, secure transition to the custom app.  The only path I can see with how the system is currently made available is to Re-auth the user with o-auth when the iframe/modal is opened (however, that is very buggy with how iframes, cookies, localstorage, and auth work.)\n3. The lack of customization was the main driver.  Very limiting components.  It would be nice to allow custom components, or offer a library that is comprehensive and common like MUI or similar.\nThank you for listening!"
