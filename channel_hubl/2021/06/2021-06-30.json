We have analytics for online marketing measures, financials and many other aspects of business. But now analytics technology is also being used for human resources (HR), particularly in employee recruitment, but also in much broader enterprise applications. This type of technology is known as people analytics, or is also referred to as HR, workforce or talent analytics.&lt;/p&gt;`\n\n\nI want only the first div; is that possible with HubL?"

Example:\n\n<https://www.hexatronic.com/_hcms/search?analytics=false&amp;domain=group.hexatronic.com&amp;pathPrefix=en/&amp;lang=en&amp;limit=100&amp;term=fiber>\n\nThat endpoint returns results from the www domain.\n\nIf you however exchange www for the subdomain, it will work!\n\n<https://group.hexatronic.com/_hcms/search?analytics=false&amp;domain=group.hexatronic.com&amp;pathPrefix=en/&amp;lang=en&amp;limit=100&amp;term=fiber>\n\nNotice that we changed from `www` to `group`.\n\nSo I thought I had solved the problem…\n\n…but now I can’t read the results from the www-domain, due to CORS (cross origin resource sharing) policy!\n\n:disappointed:\n\nThis must simply be a bug in HubSpot’s system, and while the behaviour is hinted at in the documentation, but the are <https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T22MX8Z8B-F025CABG80J/image.png|no further information>!\n\nAnybody got a clue on how to solve this?",
