Similar to the Lifecycle date / time fields on Contact, Company and stage properties on Deals?\nWould be awesome to have something like this automatically set up when Custom Object Stages are being created. As right now, we have a multiple pipelines with +11 stages, where I'll have to create at least 2 fields per stage manually to set this up.",

    "text": "Hey all!\n\nI have a strange issue with webhooks and workflows. I have a couple of workflows with corresponding webhooks setup in our test environment. From a external backend service, I would like to post data to the webhooks in order to update e.g. contacts in HubSpot.\n\nFrom my backend, I get a successful response back and no errors, but the workflow isn’t triggered. If I use the EXACT same body (copy’n’paste from the logs) and send it to the webhook through Postman, the workflow works as expected. Any thoughts?",
