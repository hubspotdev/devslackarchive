    "text": "Hi  everybody,\n\nwas just setting up a new project based on the boilerplate repo and was playing around with the the HubSpot cli mode “draft” (as in `hs watch --mode=draft source_dir target_dir` ).\n\nI don’t really get what the advantage of the “draft” mode is as I can’t see any of the CSS changes I make locally using “draft” mode in any preview (neither in the website page preview nor in the template preview available in the design manager).\n\nI can see the changes in the design manager, but they don’t take effect in any preview until I publish them. So what’s the point?\n\nAppreciate any input, thanks….\nLawrence"
