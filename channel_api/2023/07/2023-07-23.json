    "text": "Thanks <@U038DUUV3GE>, I just tried this but apparently my access token is not really an access token because I got an error message telling me _The access token must have the correct format_. I'm passing my token as the `accessToken` parameter to the `Client` constructor (I'm using the nodejs library), so maybe it is an access token but not an oauth access token? The format I have is `xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. The way I'm calling it is\n\n```const info = await Api.client.oauth.accessTokensApi.getAccessToken('xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx');```\nI cannot remember how exactly I got this token unfortunately."
