But I wanted my app to do more than that.  I have a working proto-type at this point but I still need to do a lot of work on it.  I will tell you the concept is doable but I have already put in a lot of work and still need a lot more before my app would be useable - even just by me.  The other thing is some things cannot currently be done - workflows for example."

    "text": "The errors you're encountering are related to the browser's same-origin policy, which is a security feature that prevents scripts from one origin from accessing or manipulating properties of a window or frame from another origin. This is in place to prevent cross-site scripting attacks (XSS).In your case, the local application running on <http://localhost:3000|http://localhost:3000> is trying to access frames from <https://app.HubSpot.com|https://app.HubSpot.com>, but the protocols do not match, causing the browser to block the request.Adding localhost to the \"Additional site domains\" section in the Reports &amp; Analytics Tracking settings does not resolve the issue because the issue is not related to tracking but rather to the same-origin policy.One possible workaround to this issue is to use a tool like ngrok to expose your local application to the internet using a secure HTTPS connection. This would allow you to test the integration between your local application and HubSpot's CRM tools with the same protocol, thereby bypassing the same-origin policy issue. Hopefully that helps:open_hands:",
