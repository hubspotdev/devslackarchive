If anyone in the community owns a 3D camera or 360 camera, and would be willing to borrow it out for livestreaming, ping <@U26BLKGE4> and I.\n\nWe may not have the equipment/cables needed to make that work but we can atleast see if that’s feasible or worth it.\n\nOtherwise your other 2 suggestions - we’re already planning on doing that :slightly_smiling_face: Great minds think alike",
