I just have one little question :slightly_smiling_face: With marketing emails I can add some \"personalization token\", but when I use this email in a workflow, I can't choose a data by myself that will fill each fields \"personalization token\" in my email ? Am I wrong ? I wish to use a custom code before the email step, so that I could retrieve some interesting data to inject in my email, but I don't find a way.. Can somebody please tell me if there is a way to achieve that ? :slightly_smiling_face: Thank you !",

    "text": "Ah, got you. There's no way to directly inject a custom code output into an email without first saving it to a record property.\n\nThere's a few ways about it. Easiest but probably not the prettiest is to first save the outcome of your Custom Code into a contact property, so that you can then use it as a personalization token. You can also save it to another object, i.e. a company or deal associated to the contact, but (as of now, I know they're working on it) if there's more than 1 associated company or deal etc., it will only look at that property on the first associated company or deal it finds.\n\nIf you need to store it on an object other than the contact, a more advanced way to do it is to use the crm_objects function in a custom coded email module. You then have more control over which record(s) to fetch, what fields you want from that record and how you want to show them."
