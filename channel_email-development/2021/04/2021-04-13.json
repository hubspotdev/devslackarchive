    "text": "Hey folks, *does anyone have any insight in extracting email open or click rates and passing them along to other BI or analytics tools?* It seems like not even transactional emails offer this ability, compared to, eg, SendGrid (which can fire webhooks for each user as they open, click, etc).\n\nTo give a better idea of our use case: we’d like to track the relationship between email open/click rates and usage of our product. It doesn’t seem like HubSpot has any native data integrations (and doesn’t seem to have individual webhooks to give access to this data more directly)."
