My team and I are planning to create a marketplace app for a contact synchronization with our marketing platform audiences.\n• Do customers normally interact with Marketing APIs for contacts or CRM contacts? We think they’re separate APIs/data sources but we’re not so sure. \n    ◦ Is there a simple way to port between the two or do they share data between the two sections?\n    ◦ What’s the distinction between these two types of contacts?\n• If we both want to edit a contact, will it replace or update a contact?\n    ◦ In this instance, we’d want a way to also map our own id to the contactId, is that possible?\n• What’s the best way to associate the contacts list/contacts with a campaign and how we can get those?\n• Will the current legacy V1 APIs be significantly different from the currently unavailable v3 marketing/CRM APIs?

In their <https://github.com/segmentio/action-destinations/blob/main/packages/destination-actions/src/destinations/HubSpot/upsertCompany/index.ts|documentation>, they claim they create a custom property that stores a unique ID called `segement_group_id` - I can't find evidence after a successful sync job that this property exists.   You will see however - if I try to create a new field with that same internal ID - it shows that it exists... (or is restricted).\n\n*Two questions:*\n1. Is there some way that this developer created this property but it's not visible to me?  (it is created programmatically)\n2. Should I be looking somewhere else in HubSpot to find this? \nGitHub here: <https://github.com/segmentio/action-destinations/blob/main/packages/destination-actions/src/destinations/HubSpot/upsertCompany/index.ts>",
