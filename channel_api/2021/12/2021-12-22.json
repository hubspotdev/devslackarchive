    "text": "Morning folks!\n\nFor filtering search results, I heard that there was a limit of 3 filters by an agency we are working with, is this true?\n\nI would like to do the following, which does not work, but stripping out the pipeline filter does allow it to work for example.\n\n```      // check associated open sales deal records to contact\n      var options = {\n        method: 'POST',\n        url: '<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/deals/search?hapikey=XXX>',\n        headers: {\n          'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n        },\n        body: {\n          \"limit\": 100,\n          \"properties\": [\"pipeline\"],\n          \"filterGroups\": [{\n            \"filters\": [\n              {\n                \"propertyName\": \"pipeline\",\n                \"operator\": \"EQ\",\n                \"value\": \"agent_sales\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"propertyName\": \"dealstage\",\n                \"operator\": \"NEQ\",\n                \"value\": \"booking_stage\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"propertyName\": \"brand\",\n                \"operator\": \"EQ\",\n                \"value\": \"Sunsail\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"propertyName\": \"associations.contact\",\n                \"operator\": \"EQ\",\n                \"value\": event.object.objectId\n              }\n            ]\n          }]\n        },\n        json: true\n      };```\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/search>"

    "text": "Hello, I'm looking for some help on some custom code i'm writing in a workflow. I'm utilizing the `tickets,basicApi.getById` method. I'm getting the proper response back and destructing the content that i need from the response object. Specifically, i'm targeting the `response.body.properties.content`. I have logged that out to confirm that it is the info i need using the callback method with the outputField defined there and the data outputs. Once I confirmed that, I confirmed the type of that content was string. In order to test my methods, I moved that response, as a string, into codesandbox. I wrote some regex to operate on that response. It works in codesandbox, my own vscode files, etc. But when I try to do those operations within the custom code editor, I'm getting null or that the vairable is not defined in the code. I've tried this many different ways and I'm happy to attack a snippet of my most recent attempt. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
