    "text": "Not sure which channel is most appropriate for this, but does anyone have any favorite resources for setting up advanced filtering in a blog or otherwise? \n\nFor some context: After toying with about a billion different options for a real estate property listing page for a client, I think I’ve determined that setting it up as a blog and utilizing advanced category filters is the way to go (if anyone has any different ideas please feel free to share), but I haven’t found many resources on how to implement something like that. Ideally people would be able to filter by at least 3 different categories. \n\nAny thoughts?",
