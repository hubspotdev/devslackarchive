    "text": "Hey guys, question - is it possible to create dynamic pages from a HubDB table without having a listing page?   Right now on my \"About Us\" page I have a module displaying the rows from the HubDB table called \"Job Listing\".   I would like it to auto create a new page for instance `<http://www.123.com/about-us/{{JOB|www.123.com/about-us/{{JOB> TITLE}}` and not have a listing page as `<http://www.123.com/about-us/jobs/{{JOB|www.123.com/about-us/jobs/{{JOB> TITLE}}`.  Is this an option?   Havent really found any ways around this.\n\nAlso not entirely clear the right process here.   I have a template created for the \"Job Description\" page.   However this looks entirely different than a \"Job Listing\" page as per the dcumentation, so how exactly would I go about differentiating this on a single template?  With HubL?",
