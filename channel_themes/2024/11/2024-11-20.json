I can see the module working beautifully as designed in preview, but when I attempt to publish, I get an error that states it 'Cannot resolve property' but it isn't telling me what property or where. I know its related to the blog module, but when I view the module there are no errors. When I remove it, the page will publish. Thoughts?"
