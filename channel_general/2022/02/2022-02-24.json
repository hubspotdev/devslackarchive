In such times, I can’t be silent.\n\nMy country, Ukraine :flag-ua: , has been brutally attacked with rockets this morning.\nAt 5 am Russia started its invasion of a peaceful neighbor with the claims we are “brothers”\n\nOur army is fighting as brave as it can. Our soldiers are holding the line but the enemy is the third largest army in the world. \n\nFrom my side, the only thing that I can do is to spread the word and ask people across the globe to go on marches and demand this war to stop :pray:\n\nPlease support Ukraine, a beautiful European country, to defend its freedom :pray:\n:flag-ua:\n\n",
