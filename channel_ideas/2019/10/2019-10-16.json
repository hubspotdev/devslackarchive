It could be an editable field like the module alias or classes.  There it would have much more sense and will give us the ability to use easier and logical names for easy access.\n\nIt will solve for example issues when you need to swap the module for a different one, and will save some sanity!\nGive me some kudos bois!\n To the moon!:rocket:"

Typically that would be shown in the developer JSON view, but because that's not an option, he could either |pprint and cmd+f through the poor formatting, or put the draft module in a template then look at that page's JSON view."
