Specifically, logging calls into the CRM.\n\nI want to pass 'Number called' over with the existing integration, though can't seem to get an answer if it's possible or not. I believe it only passes call outcome, call type, contacted, associations and notes over. - So the number called value would need to be in the note body.\n\nIf it is not possible, how might I be able to do it? I'm currently thinking that I use the integration anyway to log the calls (the other features are handy for the team), and then pass the additional datapoint over separately. Would I be able to search for AND update the call activity using a UID?"

I know that these APIs dont exist, but looking for ideas on how to solve these problems:\n• I need to show a list of paid receipts/invoices/quotes in my webapp. There is no payments API, so any ideas on how to collect that info and show the list in my webapp?\n• I need to show the end user the Subscription Renewal date. I dont see a subscriptions API, so any ideas on how to show that?\n• Webhooks exist, but only for public apps? How do I update information in my system upon a successful payment in HubSpot, so that I can keep a users access turned on, limit them etc.\nThanks!"
