I’m trying to improve the speed but I cannot deal with that part of it.\nI know this has been discuss by other people before, and I even see a topic but with no solution. Has anyone found any way to prevent these warnings from showing and improve the speed while keeping the recatpcha on the HubSpot form?\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/Lead-Capture-Tools/Recaptcha-in-HS-forms-slowing-down-website-speed/m-p/415705>"
