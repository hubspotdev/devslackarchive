    "text": "Anyone know how the automation api works with Workflows? My goal is to add another trigger to a workflow that exists. I’m looking through the documentation, and I don’t think this is possible. I’m trying to prevent needing a new workflow for every form / every new custom object\n\nuse case: When a custom object is created, I want to create a new form via the api. After creating this form, I’d like to add this form as a trigger to a separate workflow. (so when a visitor fills out that form, they are enrolled in that workflow.\n\nThings I’ve thought about:\n• I could enroll this person in a specific workflow upon completing this, but I would still need to create a workflow to trigger this, which is still manual work. I could clone it and change the trigger, so that isn’t terrible, but still not ideal.\n• I could use a workflow that listens to a specific property update (possible hidden field in form) but I’d really like to use form trigger if possible. This will likely be the best backup plan I have. If this happens, then enroll them in the workflow and don’t use the form submission triggers.\nLet me know if you know some way to do this of if you think my backup is the way to go here",
