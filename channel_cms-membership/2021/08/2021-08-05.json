    "text": "Hello, friends :wink:  i´m in the process of speedup Membership validation with a CUSTOM CODE WORFLOW . At this point we have about 1 minute from the clic registration in a HubSpot form. Enroll to in a Workflow , execute the custom code and receive the response from an external NodeJS ( this is fast). I don´t know how to speed up this process in HubSpot. Any idea? The final goal is to render the answer in terms of: 1.- We know you in our system. We don´t know you. We are still looking if we know you. Thanks in advance!!!"
