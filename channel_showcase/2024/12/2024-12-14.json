We all can use Linkedin data for many use cases, like lead generation, enriching a company etc.\n\nExisting APIs often require monthly subscriptions, leading to wasted credits and MUCH higher costs. <https://lavodata.com>\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Real-time data access to LinkedIn profiles, company information, posts, and more.\n* RESTful API for seamless integration with your applications.\n* Scalable infrastructure to handle high-volume requests efficiently.\n* Developer-friendly with comprehensive documentation and support.\n\nPricing Model:\n\n* Pay-as-you-go: Purchase credits as needed, with no subscriptions.\n* Volume discounts: Lower rates for higher credit purchases.\n* Free trial: Start with 50 free credits to test the service.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!"
