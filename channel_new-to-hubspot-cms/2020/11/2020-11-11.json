This Slack group is a great idea.\n\nDonâ€™t really know where to put this so I will start here: While creating a new deal or contact we want to specify the association to a custom object. However, this is not possible in the initial creation but only afterwards while editing the deal contact.\n\nIs there the possibility to specify the association in the initial creation inside the HubSpot interface? Or only while creating new contacts / deals with an API call?\n\nThank you!",
