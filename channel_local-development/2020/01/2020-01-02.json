The problem here was, that referencing assets (img, js, css) in the template itself differs when working with local hubl server or HubSpot itself.\nI already use gulp for managing assets (img optimizing, sass-&gt;css) before pushing the built assets to HubSpot. So with your info, I will now extend the gulp watch tasks to directly push to our staging HubSpot account :tada:"

    "text": "Happy New Years everyone! \n\nWe just released version 1.0.4 of the CMS CLI, which includes a few important updates:\n\n1. Support for interacting with the File Manager using a new `filemanager` sub-command. NOTE: this only works when using API key authentication at this time, and only works with the `upload` command (`hs filemanager upload [src] [dest]`).\nEx: `hs filemanager upload project/files cool-files` will create a \"cool-files\" directory in the File Manager with all included files. \n2. There is now am optional `--disable-initial` option for the `watch` command which will skip the initial upload of all files within the directory you specify to watch.\n3. A new `hs init` command which prompts a guided experience for setting up authentication for the first time (creating a `HubSpot.config.yml` file with an entry for a portal specified)\n\nRun `npm install -g @HubSpot/cms-cli` to get access to these features. As always, please send any feedback along!"
