    "text": "<@UGMGP7A72> You can inline those directly into the module html + hubl section.\n\nfor instance if you have a module that is just an anchor tag with properties for top and bottom padding it might look like this\n\n```&lt;div class=\"module-wrapper\" style=\"{{module.padding_top}}px; {{module.padding_bottom}}px;\"&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;```\nThis is totally fine inlining these styles as long as you dont intend on fixing them someplace else.  If you want to make it look cleaner you can wrap that whole section up in a hubl variable\n\n```{% set adv_styles = module.padding_top + \"px; \" + module.padding_bottom + \"px\" %} ```\nThen you can set that in inlined styles instead of writing it all out. Looks a little bit cleaner. Especially if you are rolling out a bunch of custom settings."

But instead of Personalizing the website content based on Jane's contact record data - I want to show Jane: Jack's contact info (who is also stored in the CRM). Is this doable without writing a server-side script and hitting the contacts API? My current solution is to store Jacks HubSpot user ID in a custom property on Jane's record then query the Contacts API to render Jacks info on the site for Jane - but I'd much rather do this without writing server side code if it's possible in the CMS - thanks!"
