So originally I wanted to extract data related to what service a user booked, if they completed their service, the date that the service was booked etc. Hence why we tried using behavioral events. Now with this limitation I don’t think I can pull that data. I might only be able to pull default data such as name, last name, email. Correct?"

It’s hard to give specific recommendations without knowing the specific data model for the booking information and the strategy for how you would like to leverage the data, but I would imagine some combination of custom fields at the contact level, timeline events, list membership, and workflows could get the job done."

Instead, theme asset development happens in sandbox environments, those assets are then move to the “production” portal, and applied to content objects (website and landing pages) in the content staging tool, tested, and then published."

There are a few ways around this, with my preferred method being to use query parameters appended to the redirect URL (landing page 2). Presumably, these pages are not accessible via search or organic traffic (users who did not fill out the form on landing page 1), so cacheing isn’t necessarily needed and therefore `{{ request.query_dict }}` variables make sense. \n\nAlternatively, you could add a loading spinner or otherwise delay the redirect until the data has been stored in the CRM, but even then I’m not sure if there may be a delay between when the form submission is received and when the contact object at the page level changes."
