I can’t reproduce, and searching the web didn’t get me far. However, *I’m seeing it in the page screenshot when I go to “Page Details”*.\n\nAny chance someone’s encountered something like this before?\nURL: <https://www.betterup.com/2021bundle>\nPage screenshot: <https://cdn2.HubSpot.net/hubshot/21/12/14/28769758-f340-4028-ab42-a399e750cfc2.png>",

Yes, I’ve run into this; it usually is caused by copy/pasting from Google docs or ms word and the (normally hidden) char is not supported by either the font set or the OS it's being viewed on. I’d suggest using the ‘view source’ tool and replacing with standard characters only."

    "text": "Interesting. Marks theory there makes sense. The issue feels like what you see when you try to use a glyph in a font that the font doesn’t fully support.\n\nThat kinda coincides with what you’d get from Google Docs or another editor’s formatting when copying and pasting."
