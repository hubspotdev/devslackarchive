When you submit to the Forms API, you grab that cookie value and add it to a “context” parameter that includes a param `hutk` where the value is the browser cookie value. \n2. I wrote this that shows, explains a bit. <https://gist.github.com/robertainslie/b110b8275beee1b27255c4d6e2ba2e8c|https://gist.github.com/robertainslie/b110b8275beee1b27255c4d6e2ba2e8c>\n3. Your next.JS implementation might complicate things a bit, but the HubSpot Forms API can be submitted to client side or server side. "

And there are some anomalies like it only works when I dont have the .change() method appended and when I do have it appended, some of the checkboxes don’t get checked. And for just 1 of the 15 checkboxes, it does submit without being unchecked. There’s definitely something im missing.\n\nHere’s the code I’m using that I got from the legacy docs: $('input[value=“product_1]’).prop('checked', true).change();\n\nCould someone help me figure out whats going on?",
