I wrote a function that handles this anytime I need it which I now use all the time.  I send it the data from the search along with the fromObjectType and  toObjectType for the association I want and the function then gathers all the ID values from the data and calls the batch read for the associations.  Then it goes the extra and batch reads the actual object data and returns that data.  That was well worth the effort which was a lot but I use it all the time now."

While you can export pages and posts as \"static HTML\", you can't import those back for several reasons like security.\n\n\nSomething you could do is pulling everything via the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/api/cms/pages#retrieve-pages|Pages API>, <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/api/cms/hubdb#tables|HubDB API> and <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/api/files/v3#files|File API>  and push it back into HS if needed.\n\nAnd to adress the \"catastrophe strike\" - in all my years(7+) I'm working with HubSpot, I have never encountered such a blackout with any of the companies(can't count them anymore) I've worked for/with.\n\nAs of themes/modules and other code assets - you can store them in a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/cms/setup/github-integration#set-up-continuous-integration-with-a-github-repository-using-github-actions|git repo>",

HubSpot will optimize the images to a certain amount but this is something that should be kept in mind.\n\nSomething I always tell my clients is:\n• If an image should be in a two column layout the image should be provided in something like 600-800px width. \n• Hero images can be FullHD but can be resized to 1440px or 1680px. The upscaled version of those sizes are almost not recognizable to the human eye but it's better for performance\n• Every images should be max. 200kb in file size\n\nAs for cropping you can resize/crop each image in the file manager but I'd recommend to do it with a tool like Photoshop before uploading"
