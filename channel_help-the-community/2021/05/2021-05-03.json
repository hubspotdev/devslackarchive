    "text": "Hi All -\n\nOur SaaS platform has the concept of “Multi-user organizations” (e.g. a Consultant is a member of many “tenants” on our platform. I know you cannot model this in HubSpot natively, since a Contact can only be associated with 1 Company.\n\nHas anyone structured this type of relationship using Custom Objects? I was imagining the following:\n1. *Contact* --&gt; Human beings in the real world of which we have emails\n2. *Company* --&gt; Business in the real world of which we have domains for\n3. *Users* (custom object) --&gt; an email that has authenticated to our core saas platform\n4. *Organizations* (custom object) --&gt; a tenant on our platform, which can be associated with one or more Companies\n5. *Members* (custom object) --&gt; a user associated with one or more Organizations. \n*For example, you would have something like:* \n<mailto:walt@disney.com|walt@disney.com> is a *Contact* in our CRM associated with the *Company* Disney (<http://disney.com|disney.com>). <mailto:walt@disney.com|walt@disney.com> is also *user* of our platform stored in a custom object API. <mailto:walt@disney.com|walt@disney.com> is a *member* of the Disney+ *Organization* and Pixar *Organization* on our platform. Disney+ and Pixar are part of *Organizations* associated with the *Company* (Disney) in our CRM. We enable an integration with our user pool to do the sync / matching. *Note:* I am familiar with related Companies, but i am looking to build relationships for Organizations (our term).\n\nAny good posts/resources for structuring something like this?"
