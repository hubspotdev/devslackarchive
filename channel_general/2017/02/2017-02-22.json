The issue I'm having is that the \"sort\" filter is causing hubl errors, but other filters like \"shuffle\" seem to work as expected.  Code snippet on the way...."

For example, I have a custom module that has a flexible column in it. I added the label \"Custom Module\" to the widget container and when they load up this custom module on the template level multiple times, it is quite confusing as 1) there is no distinction (except when hovering) which module is which 2) the order in the edit modules menu is not the correct order"
