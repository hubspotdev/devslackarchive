    "text": ":man-facepalming: Yes it does. Largely. Thanks. Not sure how I missed that. That covers 99% of our use cases. Thank you.\n\nThe only thing I’d like to add is maybe a modifier logic, but I imagine we’re the only ones.\nIn the system we built that we’re replacing and building into HubSpot now, you could hold down Shift to essentially change the step size from e.g. from 1 to 10 or from 1000 to 10000.\nIf we could have an “alternativeStep” property or something along those lines that is accessed by holding down shift while pressing up or down, I’d be a very happy man. Again.. we’re probably one of the only ones."

Recently there was an update that allows us to create user properties, and I feel that if we could retrieve those properties via context it could be helpful for things like setting more granular user permissions. I know that these can likely be fetched using the Users API endpoint but it would certainly be nice if we didn't have to make an api call to access these properties.",

That is great to hear.\n\n&gt; I imagine we’re the only ones.\nYou'd be surprised at how many of these are applicable to others too, so its very helpful to hear :slightly_smiling_face: Making sure I'm understanding correctly: you'd like for a number input such that the customer could change the input via the keyboard for easier and quicker input change. Is that correct?"
