But when you use the option \"Edit together\" and use the slider, it changes the units to `px` (see attached images).\nThe documentation says:\n```When a content creator edits all padding together, ... In addition, only the units shared by all sides will be available to the content creator.```\nIn my case, as I only have `rem` why does it change to `px`? I would say it is a bug.",

With regards to child themes, All parent theme modules and templates are available to the child theme unless they are overridden in the child theme. However this doesn’t go the other way. Ie child theme modules are not available to the theme that they are based off of (Parent theme)\n\nIf you want to make a module accessible to all themes you would need to add it outside of a theme in DM.\n\nMaking a “Global Modules” directory and adding the module there would do the trick at a high level."

However, because it is a child theme of `Power Theme`  if you build a page using a template from `Power Theme - OBO`  it _Will_ have access to modules from `Power Theme` , as child themes inherit basically everything from their parent theme by default.\n\nHowever — if you make a non-theme directory anywhere outside of a theme, `/GlobalModules`  for example, and place a module in there it will be available no matter what template or theme you use it on. `/GlobalModules/my-global-module.module` Will be available to any template."

    "text": "Correct — The only downside is potentially also the upside — that it shows up on every template. So if you are hosting multiple business units  and you don’t want to the module to show up in certain templates then this will sneak its way in. But I don’t think that there is anything inherently wrong with this approach by any means.\n\nAlso worth noting that in this context the global module will be “global” to the scope of your portal. Not just your theme. Ie any edits you make to the module will change the module everywhere it is located — regardless to what template, theme, etc that it is used in."
