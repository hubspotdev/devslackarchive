    "text": "Hey Cory, just an FYI, many email clients (Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo Mail to name a few) donâ€™t support custom fonts. Just wanted to let you know so your expectations are realistic. I typically advise people to go with a close default system font if they want the email to render consistently across inbox clients, and if something absolutely HAS to be on-brand typographically, to design that part of the email as an image to then be inserted as a JPG for example."
