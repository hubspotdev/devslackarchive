    "text": "Need some urgent assistance!\n\nAny idea how to set module defaults when the repeating block is an extra level deep? For example, this code <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/using-modules-in-templates#setting-default-values-for-repeating-fields|from this page>:\n\n```{% module \"my_repeater_module\" path=\"/img_repeater_module\", label=\"img_repeater_module\", \nimage=[\n  {\n    \"src\" : \"<https://cdn2.HubSpot.net/hubfs/428357/Developer%20Site/assets/logo/Developers-LOGO.svg>\",\n    \"alt\" : \"HubSpot Developers\",\n    \"width\" : 254,\n    \"height\" : 31\n  },{\n    \"src\" : \"<https://www.HubSpot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-733888614-jpg/assets/HubSpot.com/about/management/dharmesh-home.jpg>\",\n    \"alt\" : \"Dharmesh\",\n    \"width\" : 394,\n    \"height\" : 394\n  }\n]\n%}```\nWill let me set the default values in a repeatable block and even let me decide how many repeatable blocks are available by default. But this code only works if the repeating blocks are at the top level of a module. If the repeating blocks are grouped then this code doesn't work. And I can't figure out how to get it to work. :disappointed:\n\nFor example, here's my code that I'm working with right now. My Group that's repeatable is called `content`:\n\n```{% module \"two_column_module\" path=\"/Events/Event Modules/Events Two Column\", label=\"Events Two Column\", \n  content=[\n\t  {\n\t\t  \"module_type\": \"text\",\n\t\t  \"rich_text\": \"this is the left column\",\n\t  },\n\t\t{\n\t \t\t\"module_type\": \"text\",\n\t \t\t\"rich_text\": \"still the left column, second block down\"\n\t\t}\n\t]\n%}```\nBut it doesn't work. And that's probably because the `content` group isn't at the top of the module for me. it's actually one grouping down. It's `left_column &gt; content` (see the attached screenshot).",
