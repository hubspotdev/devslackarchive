    "text": "Hi everybody. I'm trying to implement a chat workflow as simply as possible. A strange behavior is that the button loads just fine on `localhost` but when I publish to a subdomain of my prod site (`staging.`), I get a console warning that says `Initial messages API response is invalid`. This comes from one of the chained JS files referenced by the main one, I think `conversations-embed.js` or something like that.\n\nThe only reference I can find to this, beyond obfuscated JS, is in <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Error-quot-Initial-messages-API-call-failed-quot/m-p/240466|this HS forum post from six years ago>, in which .@Zach Wolfson says the issue (whatever it was) was fixed.\n\nCouple of things to note:\n1. My company uses free tier. If this is just a feature of a paid membership, that's an easy answer at least.\n2. I see from some searches that using the Visitor Identification API is necessary to link a visitor to a HS contact, allowing me to pass data to the chat UI. That's a paid feature from what I understand, so again if it's a matter of upgrading, easy answer.\n3. The VI API being necessary sort of makes sense, given that one of Zach's responses in the linked forum above is \"the cookie in the browser where you are seeing that is not attached to any known contact and you have restricted the message to show to known contacts only\". However, I can't find a way to see that any such restriction is in place and my support dept expected this chat implementation to allow anonymous messaging. So if chat doesn't allow anonymous messaging, I see a clearer path to implementation.\nHopefully somebody with some experience here can help me out. Thanks!",
