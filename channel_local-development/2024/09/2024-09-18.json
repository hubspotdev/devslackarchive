However, I have a doubt about the one for accepting cookies. Is it okay to do it like this?\nThank you!\n\n```export const useHubSpot = (): UseHubSpotProps =&gt; {\n  const _hsq = typeof window !== \"undefined\" &amp;&amp; window._hsq ? window._hsq : [];\n\n  [....]\n\n  const declineCookie = () =&gt; {\n    _hsq.push([\"revokeCookieConsent\"]);\n  };\n\n  const acceptCookie = () =&gt; {\n    _hsq.push([\"doNotTrack\", { track: true }]);\n  };\n\n  return {\n    setPathPageView,\n    setTrackPageView,\n    setIdentity,\n    setTrackEvent,\n    declineCookie,\n    acceptCookie,\n  };\n};```"
