We want our dynamic pages to be editable by marketers.\n\nOne of the options we want them to have is the ability to change the position of elements on the dynamic pages.\nIt sounds like with your suggestion that any change to the position of elements would need to be performed by a developer and done via HTML.\n\nIs that correct?"
