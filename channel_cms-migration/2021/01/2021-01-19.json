    "text": "Hi everyone, this is my first post here. I am pretty new to HubSpot and am now facing my first challenge to migrate a blog from one portal to another in HubSpot. Currently I am trying to get a grasp of the crucial objects concerning blogs and the relations between these. Does anyone by chance know, where I can find a suitable ERD for this? I have created my own first draft (please ignore the missing attributes) and would like to hear your opinion if I am moving into the right direction already. Thanks in advance for your answers and feedback! (If anyone can give me a hint of how to manage the taks of migrating blogs between portals I would also be very grateful ;))",
