    "text": "Hello,\nwe integrated for one of our client a synchronization between HubSpot and Sylisus (e-commerce platforme) in order to use the HubSpot CRM. In order to associate Products to Deals via API we do the following actions:\n- Creation of deal via “Create deal” API\n- We push in the deal: product_id, name &amp; price (wich is suppose to have currency format)\nNevertheless, there is no way impose a currency. The value will always use the default option of the HubSpot instance, making multi-currency conversion impossible.\nDo you know if it’s possible to assign currency in the price object ?\nThank you in advance,",
