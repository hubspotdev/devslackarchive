    "text": "Hey <@U041Z71H30V>,\n\nThe `hs fetch` command requires as a minimum the `src` (path to the folder/file in your design manager) and then you can pass optional flags (options) such as `--overwrite` afterwards.\n\nFor example, if you were trying to fetch a module called `logo-slider.module` from the design manager, you would copy the path in the design manager (right-click &gt; copy path) and then use the following command:\n```hs fetch /modules/local/logo-slider.module /modules/local/logo-slider.module --overwrite```\nThe `dest` (2nd parameter) is optional, if you're in that current working directory and of course - your folder structure may differ from my example so, make sure to point to the correct location(s).\n\nHope this helps :slightly_smiling_face:"
