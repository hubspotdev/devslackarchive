    "text": "It seems that it may be a single bug, tying in to global theme settings in general. If you use a global theme setting reference in a module or template, it seems to always just show the default value currently. I don't believe this was the case a couple of weeks ago, so something may have happened in the mean-time. It sucks it's the holiday time, I hope they can get a fix out pretty soon. This is vital to my entry for the theme contest, and probably pretty important for some others as well."
