    "text": "Can someone help answer this question that I got from a client of ours?? I don't know how HubDB behaves quite well enough to know the answer for sure.\n\n---\nOur CTO added some functionality that would allow us to type in a url, and it would return a filtered result. However, it goes by numbers, not actual terms.\nAldi looks like <https://www.website.net/fam-rg-127?retailer=3>\nAction Alley at Aldi looks like <https://www.website.net/fam-rg-127?term=1&amp;retailer=3>\n\nThe question is if we delete Aldi and add a new retailer, will it renumber the entire list? Or would retailer #3 just go away? And, is there a way to see the number on these in HubDB?"
