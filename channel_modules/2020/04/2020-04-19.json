The previous page js is getting loaded on a new page and because of that my custom module having form is breaking giving below error.\nUncaught ReferenceError: hbspt is not defined\nat &lt;anonymous&gt;:64:9\nat x (PreviouspageJavasrcipt.js:7691)\nat h (PreviouspageJavasrcipt.js:7685)\nat XMLHttpRequest.S.te.onload\nIf I reload the page, then everything is great. There is no error in the console and page look as per design.\n \nWhen I try to visit the line no. 7685, 7691 from js. Found the above code before the lines giving error.\n/*!\n* jQuery JavaScript Library v1.11.3\n* <http://jquery.com/>\n*\n* Includes Sizzle.js\n* <http://sizzlejs.com/>\n*\n* Copyright 2005, 2014 jQuery Foundation, Inc. and other contributors\n* Released under the MIT license\n* <http://jquery.org/license>\n*\n* Date: 2015-04-28T16:19Z\n*/\nSo it is pretty state forward that the code is from jquery. Where should I modify so that my pages with form look correct when navigated from the previous page."
