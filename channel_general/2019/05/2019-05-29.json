As Stefen mentioned, static assets like CSS and JS are more straight forward, but the HubSpot objects (templates, modules, etc.) and all of their fields are more difficult to truly represent in a file format.\n\nWe have made exciting progress on this front, and will certainly involve the developer community in it's evolution over time once it is ready to be tested to ensure it solves your development workflow needs."

Once the local workflow is more realistic, having confidence your local changes will impact live content as intended is a really important component of developer success, and needs to be 1:1 - previewing can not be just _close_ to the live result, it should be representative."
