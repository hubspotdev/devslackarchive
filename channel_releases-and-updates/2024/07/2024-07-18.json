Can someone shed some light on the process here?\nWithin our company I am tasked with identifying new and interesting updates and in some cases the actual update disappeared at some point.\nLatest example would be the new lead scoring and Custom Properties on the User Object.\n\nThanks in advance if anyone has any insights about this.",
