    "text": "We are building our new website for our company in HubSpot and I would like to know if anyone has a workflow that works for them. We donâ€™t need many custom modules since it is a static site and is an internal project.\n Do you create your site locally and then transfer the files and code to HubSpot? It just seems hard to write code and styles in the HubSpot IDE, and the code completion not working. Any help would be appreciated. :thumbsup::skin-tone-3:"
