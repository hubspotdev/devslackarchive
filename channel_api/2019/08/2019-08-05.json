    "text": "Hi Guys, we are experimenting with importing contacts into HubSpot via form submissions, the goal is to associate it with a landing page which is part of a campaign so that the contacts source is attributed to that campaign. We are submitting the form data along with hs_context set with the landing page name and url but it doesn’t get attributed to the campaign. I am assuming this is because it is just taking a URL and not an actual Page ID so its not really associating it with that page, its just linking to it from the contacts timeline. Is there any way around this? Is there a way to truly link a submission to a HubSpot page? Or any alternative ideas to resolve the problem would be gratefully received. Many thanks!",
