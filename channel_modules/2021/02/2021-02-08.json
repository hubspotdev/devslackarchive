As a heads up the majority of users are in the North American Hemisphere so expect a response within those general hours.\n\nTo answer your specific question  - we encourage starting your projects from the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes/HubSpot-cms-boilerplate|Theme boilerplate> as we have an example of how to make a nav menu using the HubL menu function right here\n<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/main/src/modules/menu-section.module/module.html>"
