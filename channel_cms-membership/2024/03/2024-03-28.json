    "text": "Hello everyone,\nI have a use case where we want to list open positions on a website and allow prospects to apply. The prospects should then be able to register and log in to the site, then view the status of their applications (and only their applications). I'm able to dynamically display custom object records and filter them, but am stuck at trying to only show the application records that apply to the logged in user. Is there a good way I can identify who the logged in user is (applicant) and return only the associated application records? So far I've been unsuccessful finding anything in the documentation. Thanks for any help!",
