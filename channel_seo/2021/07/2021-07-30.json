It will variate a lot depend on your current theme/templates and modules.\nI will suggest to focus first on your javascript, delaying execution and ideally removing as much as possible re-doing some functionalities in pure CSS when possible. If you are still using jQuery, you will need to rework all your JS in vanilla JS to avoid jQuery at all.\n\nThis is what I have found most worth time spent (assuming you already lazy loaded your images below the fold).\nAfter that, CSS is usually tricky because you are going to require a ton of rework and know in depth you setup within all the modules on the pages.\nDoable, but a lot of time consuming."
