And say we had an opt in to the feature on the page editor that would link to a global content editor that a marketer could use. When the person in the page editor opts in to global content editing, they're also opting in to the same ability to edit global content from the design manager. So, people in the design manager would then start to see a button linking to a global content editor when they select global groups. Does that....freak you out at all? Or is that ok?"
