    "text": "Random email editor thing I just ran into. It seems like if you don't set a background color on a group/module, it adds `background-color:#` and `bgcolor=\"#\"` to the inline styles, and I thiiiiiink `bgcolor=\"#\"` makes the background black in some or possibly all email clients? It seems like that's what was going on. We were having black boxes showing up in a few places in some email clients. Could we change this so that leaving the background color field blank prints nothing instead of `background-color:#`?"
