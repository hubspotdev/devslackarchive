    "text": "Has anyone built out the playbook function into a custom card via UI Extensions? We've been using playbooks for the last 2 years and suddenly they have gone haywire (been on to support about it). Seems they have been 'not' working on our account to-date, and now they are working as they should, which doesn't work for us lol.\n\nBasic needs: 'some' information (10-20 properties) on a contact needs to be re-confirmed at certain points, with any new information updated as necessary. A workflow will kick-off when this is checked. I was thinking of building out a form within a custom card, which 'on submit' will call a serverless function to update the properties on the contact with the form values / enrol in a workflow?\n\nAny other /better / easier ways to approach this...?",
