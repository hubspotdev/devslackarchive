But my question is, why is `{% set en_url = group.translations.en.absolute_url %}` not working while `{% set en_url = content.translated_content.en.absolute_url %}` does work. These are both objects and aren’t inside any for loops. The `absolute_url` can only be accessed within a for loop it it’s `group.translations`."
