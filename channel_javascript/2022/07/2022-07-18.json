    "text": "Hi Everyone, I hope someone can help me here. I have read so much about HS integrations that I would consider myself already a pro in HubSpot-form integrations if I would get it working -.-\n\nThe issue I'm facing is that I get the\n*v2.js:1 The onFormReady function in hbspt.forms.create requires jQuery. It was not run.*-error as far as I use the `onFormReady` callback, no matter if I use jquery within the callback.\n\nI have to execute code within the Iframe because I have to populate some hidden fields with values.\n\nmy forms init call looks like this:\n\n```hbspt.forms.create({\n\t\t\tregion: 'eu1',\n\t\t\tportalId: 'xxxxxxxx',\n\t\t\tformId: 'xxxxx-xxxx-xx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xx',\n\t\t\ttarget: '#hbspt-form',\n\t\t\tonFormReady: () =&gt; {\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log('Form Ready!!!');\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t});```\nfrom: `<https://js-eu1.hsforms.net/forms/v2.js>`\n\nI hope somebody knows how to solve this issue or how to execute code within the embedded form.\nThx in advance!",
