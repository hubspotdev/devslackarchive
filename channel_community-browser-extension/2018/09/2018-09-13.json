We are at 270 weekly users of the extension!\n\nAs always please rate the extension, the more ratings, the more visibility it gets on the chrome web store, the more people interested in contributing to the extension, the faster features get built and bugs get squashed.\n\nPutting the number into perspective 270 is 37% of the total number of people in the HS dev slack(731).\nThe way I see it, we’re becoming the Google Chrome of HubSpot developer tools :dark_sunglasses: . (Google Chrome’s market share is 41.22% of worldwide users)\n\nYes there are developers not on this slack. So the % usage among all HS devs is lower but I don’t know of any other stats accurately quantifying HubSpot developers. That said, still a cool achievement."

It’s still the wild west in that project pitch any ideas you have and if you wanna dive into code, go for it. there are no rules.\n\nBasic idea of what we want to do is make a framework similar to foundation or Shopify’s Timber.\n\nA framework that makes it faster and easier to build high quality HubSpot sites."
