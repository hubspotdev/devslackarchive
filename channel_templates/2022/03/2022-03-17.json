    "text": "Something is definitely up, we have a module utilizing hubdb data that is in the not dynamic_page_hubdb_row branch, and it does not render any html unless I remove all the calls to hubdb.\n\nThe module works in edit mode, preview, and if I unpublish and republish the page it shows for a pageload (or two), so I'd guess it has something to do with page caching maybe.\n\nEDIT: I moved the module's hubdb calls also to the template end of things and now it works but that stuff pertains to the module so it's not exactly ideal.\n\nThe module does access the same table as the dynamic page utilizes. Going to throw a message to support if someone there wants to take a look at this."
