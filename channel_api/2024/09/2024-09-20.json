However running into the issue of having to associate all contacts related to that company or none. Would love to be able to only associate the specific contact e.g. Owner\n\nPlayed around with the custom code actions in HS, but not getting much progress.  I suspect this has been solved/completed before so would love to hear from anyone who has the solution or advice :slightly_smiling_face:",
