Our integration works, but we want to improve it in the following way:\n\nWe want customers to be able to call using our sipsim service when clicking this button. Specifically, so that the call is made from the customer's mobile phone, and not through HubSpot. Neither the option of calling through the browser, nor the option of calling through the HubSpot app on the phone suits us. Specifically through the phone.\n\nBasically all  we need to make it possible on our side is to get webhook with these fields:\n\n1. caller\n2. receiver\n3. some kind of ID of client\nTell me please if that possible!",
