He told me that developer support is only here in the HubSpot Slack and that is the only way I can contact you ...so hopefully it is correct.\n\nHey guys, I am having an issue with my application and I am kinda stuck now. So I have an public OAuth2 connection since I am a product manager at <http://Boost.space|Boost.space> and just to simplify we are something like <http://Make.com|Make.com> and Zapier (saying that so you understand it is not me who is using the application and it is not for personal use-cases).\n\nI do have many scopes in place and I believe that all of them should be approved...unfortuntely once I am trying to make a connection or one of our clients that uses <http://Boost.space|Boost.space> and HubSpot it gives us an error.\n\nDo you have any idea what I need to adjust?\n\nThank you in advance guys.",

Indeed, I can see that the association between the deal record [redacted] and the companies [redacted] and [redacted] took place via API as expected as you can see here. It looks like the association might have missed a parameter to update the Deal-Company association field, Kevin. Unfortunately, when it comes to API management, as chat support reps, since we are not developers, we don't have access to troubleshoot how the association could be made on the backend to update that information. To be transparent and guide you to the right place, in this case, you could consult our <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Developers/ct-p/developers|HubSpot developer forum>, this is a site monitored by HubSpot developers who would be better able to advise on custom code and APIs, both HubSpot and external developers are extremely active, and it is the fastest and most accurate resource for any custom coding queries! There is also a<https://developers.HubSpot.com/slack| Slack channel >for developers where you can also get assistance from our developers :slightly_smiling_face: There you will find all the necessary data to inspect the API integration you are working on, Kevin"
