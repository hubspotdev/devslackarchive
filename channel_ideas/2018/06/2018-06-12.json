Developer quick menu which gets added to the real nav - which basically links you to the most common things devs use.\n3.cachebuster button which adds a randomly generated query param to the URL\n4. some modifications to the HubL reference panel - while it’s a great idea, I don’t personally end up using it, partly because I forget it’s there, partly because I don’t trust it. In the past it didn’t have the most up to date info. and filters and some other features don’t show any code snippets or usage examples so they’re kind of useless",
