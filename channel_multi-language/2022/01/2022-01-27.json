It contains the versions from B variant.\n\n*The rest of the content is not correct*, it contains text inherited from original A variant.\n\nExamples of data returned for B variant &gt;&gt;\n\nMeta description and name - are correct for B:\n``` \"metaDescription\": \"This is a meta description of variant B.\",\n \"name\": \"A/B testing page for Memsource (B)\",```\nContent from API of the first module - is incorrect for B:\n```\"text\": \"Phrases usefull in everyday life.&lt;br&gt;Taught with video clips of real locals.\",```\nit should be:\n```\"text\": \"Phrases useful in everyday life version B.&lt;br&gt;Taught with video clips of real locals version B.\",```\nSome content missing completely and are simply not present in none of the JSONS.\nOur internal conclusion: HubSpot API returns wrong data and according to the HS API documentation we are not able to configure the call to return actual version for the B variant.\n\nThanks!"
