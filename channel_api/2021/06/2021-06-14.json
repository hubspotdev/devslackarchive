We do not have a new version of all of our APIs ready yet so we have to keep up our old documentation in the mean time. That's the meaning behind legacy docs. The term legacy docs is not directly tied to deprecation or sunset of any APIs. In general if you can't find the API on our current modern docs the legacy doc version is the only version currently available. It does not mean it's deprecated. To be kept up to date on deprecation announcements please subscribe to the developer changelog, where all of those are announced. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog>",

How can I get the event data for movements through a deal pipeline?\n2. Why do the CRM objects not come with all relevant information that HubSpot has for that given object? Is there an easy way to get less-normalized data for the dimensions?\nMore generally, does anybody have a map that shows the API calls for each HubSpot data object?\n\nThanks for your help! :partying_face:",
