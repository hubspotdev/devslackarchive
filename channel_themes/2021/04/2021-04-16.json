Now that they are in HTML, people need to adjust, which is a good thing because that \"blurry line\" between what is \"editor territory\" and what \"dev territory\" is not so blurry now. For me it is pretty clear."

The videos from HubSpot that i have seen are often \"high level\"  that give a genereal overview. Videos that cover things like:\n1) how to create a CTA and what options do i have?\n2) How to create a Landing Page / Website page and what are the differences ( in terms of  reporting for example)\n3) What options do i have to import stuff\n4) how to redirect a page\nwould enable editors to get more comfortable more quickly!"
