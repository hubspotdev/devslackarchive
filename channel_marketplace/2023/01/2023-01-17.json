    "text": "Hi everyone, I hope the team at HubSpot sees this. There is an option in Stripe to automatically calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST with one line of code. Which would greatly benefit all business on the HubSpot Assets Marketplace that need to collect taxes and stay compliant (just about all, IMO). I hope you can enable this, or make it optional for the provider to enable it, as currently it's really difficult to remain compliant in all countries. It's just a line of code: <https://stripe.com/tax>.\n\nWe also currently have to ask every time for customer's details, especially EU customers, before filling in and sending a proper invoice, as the HubSpot Assets Marketplace doesn't provide us with any details for that (company legal name, company address, VAT number if applicable). So, that would also help with this as well. Thanks!",
