    "text": "Hi All - Thanks in advance for your help. I am using the HubSpot SuperMetrics connector to pull data from HubSpot into a report &amp; need to filter users who filled out a certain HS registration form ON a particular HS landing page. In the connector I see a object for form submissions but I don't see how to filter that down to submissions on a certain page &amp; because I'm not familiar with the schema I don't know where to look. The forms api doesn't seem to have a field for page submitted on <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/forms_overview> . Any ideas?",
