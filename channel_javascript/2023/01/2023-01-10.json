Is there a way to remedy this?\nIn the best of worlds there would be some API method, codegen package or similar that can create type files for each object.\nIt would read from the portal Im connected to, spitting out explicit type files, something like:\n\n```ts\ntype Company {\n    properties: {\n        explicitProperty1: string,\n        explicitProperty2: string,\n        // ...\n    };        \n}```\nThen somehow we could feed them into the client and live happily ever after.\nDoes this already exist? Or how do you manage types for the entities when using the API?",
