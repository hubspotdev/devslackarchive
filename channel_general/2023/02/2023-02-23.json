I am following the <https://github.com/HubSpot/oauth-quickstart-nodejs|NodeJS Oauth 2.0 Quickstart guide> but am running into issues with the redirect_uri. I can not for the life of me figure out what it should be. My app is served on <http://localhost:3000> using the docker image. I click the \"Install the app\" button which redirects me to a page where I need to authorize. I select my account, then I get this error. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

However, there might be a custom solution to this which would require a developer. I would advise to check in our Developer Slack where you might find other users which tried to achieve this:<https://developers.HubSpot.com/slack| https://developers.HubSpot.com/slack> “\n\nAny ideas of how this can be done?\n\nThanks!",

    "text": "This is my opinion, and could differ from others!\n\nI don’t think there is any valuable content for search in a non ecommerce site. Services pages are not really what they are looking for in search, and if they are they are a bit silly and can use main nav to find those answers if site architecture is setup. If the reason someone would be using search to find a service, then the navigation is an issue, and not the fact that search reach across domains.\n\nsearching only blog:\nThat being said — If they just want the blog to be searchable, you could create a search bar on their website and have it pointed TO the HubSpot search, and it would work to search HubSpot.\n\nsearch both sites properly:\nNow, if you want this to search both sites, then you would need to use apis for the website and then do custom coding in both places to create your own search, or use the search that is provided, and modify it so that it combines the results and displays them\n\nmanaged search:\nThere are also products like <https://www.addsearch.com/> and <https://www.algolia.com/> that manage this for you, you can setup the indexing of pages, and then include the search code on both websites.\n\nHacky answer lol <@U01QVR44MEY>\nCreate your website pages in HubSpot, add title, meta, and site content into it, and then redirect those pages to the real website pages. Might need some finessing of this to make it work, but you could utilize HubSpot search on both sites, and just have it redirect to the actual pages on the website for non blog searching"

So easily stated, right?\n\nHowever, from what I'm reading, in order to accomplish this, the only method is via a CRM Card. Which first requires a _public_ app that would be listed on the marketplace (?? why, this is only for us) including OAuth (don't need), and a data fetch (also don't need) … a whole lot of stuff that doesn't apply when all we want is to pop a modal with an iFrame whose URL includes a query param of that Contact's record ID.\n\nIf anyone is curious, the iFrame would be displaying a Retool app that interacts with our HubSpot data via API.\n\nDon't want a public app, don't need OAuth or a data fetch, just an iFrame. I suppose I could even live with it not being in a modal. This … should be simpler? Any workaround ideas welcomed!",
