    "text": "<@UG52C29EE>, thank you for your response!! I am trying to pass ,\"publishedAt\":\"{{zap_meta_timestamp}}\", but it is throwing an error \"*We had trouble sending your test through.*\nThe app returned \"Invalid input JSON on line 1, column 165: Cannot deserialize Map key of type `java.lang.Integer` from String \"publishedAt\": not a valid representation, problem: (java.lang.NumberFormatException) For input string: \"publishedAt\"\". This usually happens when your Zap is missing a required field or a field value isn't in a recognized format.\". Do you have any idea?"
