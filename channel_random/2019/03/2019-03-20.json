They litterally mean everything can already be rendered on the server side of the code. The client doesn’t actually need to render, only act as a window to the already rendered models.\n\nThus an MMO the size of skyrim could have no loading screens whatsoever. because instead of the server just storing data like positioning, what’s in your inventory etc. IT is able to handle ALL of it, and what you see for the client is just a “view”"

But again, and maybe this is just my lack of knowledge of networking and our current infrastrcutre, but how can it be feasible for most people due to network speed, etc? The figure I saw thrown around was all you need is a 50mbps connection and your basically good to go. Is that something that most people have? Sure if people have fiber that's fine, but then don't most people just have fiber for like 99% of the way and the last leg is something more standard that then could throttle it?"

    "text": "Yea its not the standard COS anymore, they used to use it but starting soon, they are moving all HUGs to the splashthat site. I mean its cool and all, but it really is limited to what those HUGs can do as they stripped away some features like template creation or editing. Which I totally understand if they are looking for everyone to be uniform, but it just seems like it would be better if they just moved back to using the COS as they lose the contacts and smart content and all that jazz"
