    "text": "Hey everyone, i have an e-commerce build with reactjs and nextjs and i want to migrate only the content part to HubSpot CMS. What I want to achieve is an hybrid approach: my website will be still on my servers and the search page, product page and checkout page will stay as is but i need to edit the other pages like: about us, fa page, ecc. through HubSpot CMS Editor. Is this approach realistic? How can be done?"
