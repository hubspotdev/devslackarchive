I managed to do this by using VML for outlook - however in outlook it then looks like that the background size is editable (see image). When you drag it, nothing actually happens - but the little boxes on the sides appear if you click anywhere on the VML background.\n\nHas anyone experienced this before, and know how to get red of it? my code is below.\n\n        `&lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;`\n        `&lt;v:rect xmlns:v=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml\" fill=\"true\" fillcolor=\"none\" stroke=\"false\" style=\"width: {{ maxWidth }}; height: 645px;\"&gt;`\n            `&lt;v:fill type=\"frame\" src=\"{{ widget.background_image.src }}\" color=\"none\" /&gt;`\n                `&lt;v:textbox style=\"mso-fit-shape-to-text:false\" inset=\"0,0,0,0\"&gt;`\n        `&lt;![endif]--&gt;`",
