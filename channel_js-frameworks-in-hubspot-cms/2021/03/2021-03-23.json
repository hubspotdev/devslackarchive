So here's the summary of it:\n\nI have a React application, in which I am trying to integrate a HubSpot chatbot and Meetings widget. Simply by following HubSpot guideline's for integration, I've found a way to actually make both the chatbot and meetings widget appear on my React powered website (and they are functional). Chatbot is embedded via script inside of index.html while Meetings widget is displayed trough an iframe ( couldn't come up with any better workaround ).  The problem of this approach is that both of those widgets cannot be tracked with other analytic tools such as Google Analytics / Facebook Pixel because they are not accessible from within the React app in a form of component.  I've searched for some npm packages that might make the integration with React easier, and the only thing that I came up with was `react-HubSpot-form`  but that one doesn't solve the issue with integrating chatbot nor meetings widget.\n\nSo my question to this community is, has anyone ever tried making the React component for HubSpot chatbot and meetings widget? Any tips or directions?\n\nThanks in advance :slightly_smiling_face:"
