    "text": "I was just looking at the new V3 API but how can I filter on last modified deals? Using the following filter doesn’t seem to work:\n\n```{\n    \"filters\": [\n        {\n            \"propertyName\": \"hs_lastmodifieddate\",\n            \"operator\": \"GTE\",\n            \"value\": \"2020-04-16T12:00:00.000Z\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"limit\": \"5\"\n}```\nI get a `400 Bad request` response on this one. Is it possible that filters are just not working with dates?",
