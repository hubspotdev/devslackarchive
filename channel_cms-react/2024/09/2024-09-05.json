Unfortunately, no `hublData` appears in `props` of the module. My code looks like this:\n\n```export const Component = (props) => {\n  return (<>\n    <p>Hi!</p>\n    { props.hublData?.pageId }\n  </>);\n};\n\nexport const hublDataTemplate = `\n  {% set hublData = {\n      \"pageId\": content_id,\n    }\n  %}\n````\nDid anyone have similar issues?
