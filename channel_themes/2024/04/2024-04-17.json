    "text": "Hi everyone! I'm encountering a challenge while customizing a HubSpot theme and could use some guidance. In the template for the homepage, I've added a navfooter module which contains a form. Within this form, there's a \"Privacy Policy\" hyperlink that should be displayed with a font size of 12px. However, it appears to be rendering with a font size of 16px.\nI've tried inspecting the element in my browser's developer tools to identify the CSS rule causing this discrepancy. While I can locate the rule and see its effect, when I navigate to the corresponding CSS file in the theme, either the rule is not present or it's empty.\nI understand that HubSpot themes can be complex, and there may be dynamic loading or compilation processes at play. Could someone provide guidance on the most effective way to pinpoint and modify the CSS rule affecting this hyperlink's font size?\nAny insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your assistance!",
