    "text": "Hey <@U03PCH27EAV> - I only have limited experience with HubL and it's exclusive to CMS Hub. With that disclaimer in mind, I know I was unable to pull the data I wanted from a company, where the contact record was associated with the particular company, if I used the \"company_collection__contact_to_company_unlabeled\" association, and when I used the \"company_collection__primary\" association is consistently works every time.\n\nMight there be a different function that pulls the primary company a contact is associated with? If so, I recommend giving that a shot to see if it helps."

    "text": "hi there! I am new to hubl and html integration to HubSpot templates. I am trying to set a parameter in a web url to a HubSpot contact's `hs_object_id` by doing the following:\n`&amp;tracking={{contact.hs_object_id}}` and I see that this comes back as `CONTACT.HS_OBJECT_ID` instead of the actual string value. Was wondering if anyone had any pointers or ideas to remediate this issue? Thank you!",
