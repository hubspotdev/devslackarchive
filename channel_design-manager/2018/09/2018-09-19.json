    "text": "Hello guys,\n\n I was testing the new video embed player integration with Vidyard and I have noticed that the video quality drops drastically on smaller screens. This is a video that I was testing on <https://play.vidyard.com/zL73BZi5fPVU4dh1bhDUiD?v=4.1.2&amp;viral_sharing=0&amp;embed_button=0&amp;hide_playlist=1&amp;color=FFFFFF&amp;playlist_color=FFFFFF&amp;play_button_color=2A2A2A&amp;type=inline&amp;disable_popouts=1> .\neven if I change the quality of the video to be the highest, has no effect though. Any suggestions?\n\nKind Regards",
