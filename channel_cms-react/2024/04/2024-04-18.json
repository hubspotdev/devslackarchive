I’m not exactly sure which of all the changes I made did the trick, but I’ll leave some things here for you to review, in case it helps.\n\n1. Personal Access Key SCOPES\n\t\n~It had been a while since I last renewed it, and when I had to renew it the other day, I noticed that 3 new scopes had been added, which weren’t being considered with my old Personal Access Key. These are:~\n    a. ~developer.app_functions.read~\n    b. ~developer.app_functions.write~\n    c. ~developer.projects.write.~\n2. Folder Structure and content\n\nProject-Root\n    ◦ Project\n        ▪︎ App\n            • app.functions\n                ◦ fetch.js\n                ◦ package.json\n                ◦ serverless.json\n            • app.json\n            • componentes\n            • package.json\n            • etc…\n        ▪︎ hsproject.json\n    ◦ Theme\nI added an app.json file at the same level as app.functions, I used the repository example as a reference, the only thing I know is that without this file the calls do not work.\n<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react/blob/main/examples/serverless/cms-with-serverless-project/app/app.json>\n\nI also want to mention that in the Fetch function, I was using axios, but unfortunately, it threw a server error because it didn’t recognize the library, if you are using axios adding to the package.json that exists in the same folder should be enough. You can try some of these points I mentioned above. Let me know.",

When I changed the component name it probably discarded that old cache, and then I changed its name back to what it was, and it started working again :eyes:"

    "text": "Hello CMS React devs,\n\nA recent change of note in the dev server with version `0.15.3` is the support of poxying calls to serverless functions. This means the local dev server will receive calls you are making to root relative serverless endpoints i.e. `/hs/serverless` and `/_hscms/api` and forward them along to your portal's domain. This should allow for local development to \"work\" with deployed serverless functions. This does not yet support developing the serverless functions along side the CMS React in a local context, though we do hope integrate further with Developer Platform Serverless Functions and support a full local dev flow for that use case.\n\nPlease see the release log for other changes <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react/blob/main/docs/release-log.md>"
