I've created a few thank you pages, each with a unique URL and in my forms on HS I've asked it to redirect to <http://site.net/thank-you|site.net/thank-you> after submission. However, the thank you page is only loading within the iframe of the form, which doesn't look very good and I doubt will track because the URL within the browser tab isn't changing.",
