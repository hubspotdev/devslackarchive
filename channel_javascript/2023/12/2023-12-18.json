The data will only be passed when tracking a page view or an event (with either the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/events/tracking-code#track-page-view|trackPageView> or <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/events/tracking-code#events-js-api|trackEvent> functions).\nHowever, pushing a `trackCustomBehavioralEvent` afterwards has no effect."

    "text": "are you able to log some of this code out to be sure it is firing when you do trackEvent ? A lot of times people use SPA and integreate this stuff and the page lifecycle doesn’t work the same as a normal website with trackPageView and this needs to be sent via the app\n\nIt might be best to do something like\n```console.log('starting identify')\n_hsq.push([\"identify\", { { email: \"USER_EMAIL\" } }])\nconsole.log('end identify')```\nand then verify that this is sending and that you don’t get any errors"
