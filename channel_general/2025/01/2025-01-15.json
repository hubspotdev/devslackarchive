    "text": "I need your opinion and suggestion. We are currently working on a project where we are using Laravel. The client has their own database where they input information or new products. Our Laravel application enables these data to be transferred to our HubDB on the HubSpot platform and displayed on a dynamic page within our HubSpot application.\nHowever, we want to simplify this process by creating a more efficient and straightforward API, completely removing the Laravel platform. In this case, would you recommend using Firebase or Xano? The key requirement is that the data should automatically appear in our HubDB, and any changes the client makes in their database should be immediately synchronized and reflected on our side.\nThank you in advance for your suggestion!",
