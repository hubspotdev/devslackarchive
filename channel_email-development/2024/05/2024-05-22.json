    "text": "Hi all, We're looking to dynamically render images in HubSpot Sales emails based on a custom property on the contact. The custom property holds an image URL that would need to be passed to an &lt;img&gt; tag to be displayed. We noticed that while you can add custom HTML to HubSpot marketing emails, you can't do so for Sales emails. Has anyone found a way to achieve this? I believe it was possible a few months ago but they've removed that functionality :thinking_face:"

    "text": "Not really. Got any specific questions?\n\nI do have these notes that I took when I was developing some DnD templates for a client.\n\n• You can’t add your own custom CSS to the &lt;head&gt;.\n• There is a thin amount of padding (maybe 10px) that goes around the outside of the entire email on mobile devices. This padding cannot be adjusted.\n• A border that goes all the way around the email body is possible in a DnD template, but it’s limited to 8px in thickness. And it will also wrap around ALL of your content, including the logo in your header and your footer.\n• Drag and drop builder emails are locked to 600px wide on desktop. This can be changed in the main account settings, but it applies to all DnD templates.\n• Default font sizes for paragraphs and headlines 1 and 2 can be set for the entire template, but only even numbers can be chosen, and not all even numbers are available. For access to all font-sizes adjustments need to be made at the module-level each time you need it.\n• Font sizes cannot be adjusted for mobile devices. So the fonts you choose for your desktop experience need to also work for mobile."
