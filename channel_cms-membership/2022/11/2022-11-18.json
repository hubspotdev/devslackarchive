    "text": "My client's had an issue where somehow a contact was able to access another (unrelated) contact's data when logged in. I can see that same contact's data when the \"contact_vid\" is set to \"null\" so I suspect that what happened is:\n\n1. The user logged in, and somehow reached the membership page with a null contact_vid (I don't know why a contact_vid wasn't assigned in the first place)\n2. There are contacts in the portal without a contact_vid (presumably imported), and the first record with a null contact_vid was exposed\nThis is not great, HubSpot Support sent the client back my way since I developed the membership site and I've added in a condition to check for the contact_vid as a failsafe, but I really don't think a null value should expose any contact data in the first place. Who might I reach out to about this?",
