    "text": "I am working on a Javascript issue and hitting a few roadblocks that I am hoping you brilliant humans can help with. I am able to get the solution working in my portal, but when using a customer's forms, I'm unsuccessful.\n\nThe goal is to pass a static value to a hidden multiselect checkbox on a form using Javascript. I am using this in my portal:\n\n```&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//js-eu1.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;\n  hbspt.forms.create({\n    region: \"eu1\",\n    portalId: \"4*****\",\n    formId: \"2923d650-8936-4e71-9742-**********\"\n  });\n&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;\n  \nwindow.addEventListener('message', event =&gt; {\n   if(event.data.type === 'hsFormCallback' &amp;&amp; event.data.eventName === 'onFormReady') { document.getElementbyId(\"hs-form-iframe-0\").contentDocument.querySelector('input[name=\"webinar_attended\"]').value =('Webinar 2');\n   }\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;```\nWhen the form is embedded it is within an iFrame. I confirmed when I used the <https://app-eu1.HubSpot.com/submissions/26610434/form/d5bfa503-673d-4915-b7cd-fdc1bcf0c449/submissions/e463ba3f-e721-474f-a5d0-797f23633d23?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapp-eu1.HubSpot.com%2Fforms%2F26610434%2F|customer's form> it was also wrapped in the same iFrame.  When I updated the code to use the customer's form it does not work. I also tried selecting different classes and IDs to see if I could change the value. I tried to directly set the value using:\n```document.getElementById('property_id').value = 'Sand Innovation Summit, Raleigh';```\nI can't find any difference in their forms and the ones that I am using. Can you think of any reason why their form would not pass a hidden value as expected?",
