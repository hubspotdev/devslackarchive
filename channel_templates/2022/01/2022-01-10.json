    "text": "Hi there and thanks to everyone who reached out! I was able to figure it out - all of the HubSpot forums made template building/custom modules a lot harder than it needs to be. I was able to input my own code into modules and have it come out perfectly. In Campaign Monitor, you just simply upload your code. In HubSpot you have to go here, there, and everywhere to add a simple button. Oof! Glad I figured it out though - thanks again for everyone's help!"
