Let me know when you have some time  to let me know about what’s possible for exposing more properties when you have a moment. The biggest draw back we have at the moment is being able to create sequences when using an email alias, even though the alias is set as the default when enrolling contacts into sequences via the general interface. Appreciate the help!"
