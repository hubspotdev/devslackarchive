Then the user needs to fill in other types of inputs with personal data and on submit I need to sync all these to the HubSpot CRM (in the contacts object). Would you recommend I do this with a JS component or not? Any feedback will be appreciated!",

These would happen in an \"Island\" in the context of a JS Building Block.\n\nYou would likely need a serverless function as well to do the job of talking to the the CRM for an update. This serverless function would expose and endpoint which would receive that second client side call.\n\nDoes that all make sense?"
