    "text": "Hi <@UFBNA9K9A> i’m having a similar issue and wanted to know how you were able to solve this. I’m trying to use the subscription features within my app and running into 2 issues:\n1. getting a 401 error when I use the `App id` as well as a `API Key` <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/webhooks> `\"message\": \"Authentication credentials not found. This API supports both API Key and OAuth 2.0 authentication and you can find more details at <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/auth/oauth-overview>\"`\n2. While the hasn’t yet been “verify”, similar status as Martin screenshot, i’m trying to install the app using OAuth, and while the process was successful, the app didn’t show up in neither my Staging, or Testing account.\nAny thoughts would be super helpful"
