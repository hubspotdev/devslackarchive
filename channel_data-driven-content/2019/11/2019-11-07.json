Thank you for this, I really appreciate it :raised_hands:\n\nThis solution is almost what I was looking for but there might be multiple instances of the module in one page, so it may be unclear for the content editors which select/choice is for which displayed data. Do you have an idea how to put this choice/select input (the one inside _[OPTION] Add co-author_) inside a module's input list?\n\nThanks again for your help :slightly_smiling_face:"
