    "text": "If they no longer exist that warning in SEMrush can safely be ignored. 404’s are really only a problem when the page is supposed to be returning a 200 or other status code.\n\nI’d instead wonder where SEMrush is discovering those urls given that they no longer exist. Is the crawl recent? Maybe try a new one and see if they still pop up? If they do, investigate the crawl path and find out if you might need to do some internal link cleanup. "
