    "text": "What is best practice for canonicalisation of HubSpot Blog Listing pages? Our SEO software is flagging duplicate pages titles for the blog/page/1 &amp; blog/page/2 etc, but HubSpot says this “For blog listing pages, select a canonical URL setting. *If you select Set each blog listing page’s canonical URL to the first page in its series, search engines may be unable to find subsequent pages for your blog listing page.*” - I’m wondering if need to add something into our template to support canonicalisation?\n\nAny advice appreciated!"
