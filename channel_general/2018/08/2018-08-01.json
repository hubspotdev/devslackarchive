This initial test runs your lead flow simultaneously as a top-bar lead flow, bottom-right, bottom-left and pop-over lead flow and tests which of the 4 versions generates the highest conversion rate and optimises traffic to get the version that they're most likely to convert on. Everything else stays the same, just the position of the lead flow is tested (for this first beta)."
