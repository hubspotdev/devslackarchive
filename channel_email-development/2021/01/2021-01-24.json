I managed to do this when I hardcode the contact id, but not when I use contact.id as a variable. Any help would be appreciated! My current code is:\n\n`{% set associated_objects = crm_associations({{ contact.hs_object_id }}, \"USER_DEFINED\", 2) %}`\n`{% for listing in associated_objects.results %}`\n`{{ listing.listingname }}`\n `{% endfor %}` ",
