It’s important to note that they have one: many relationships with contacts and companies. Associations can be managed through the CRM associations endpoints.”\n\nBut I may be wrong, the new docs don’t seem to give quite enough information to work out all the extra little things you need to do"

I'd prefer Auth over memberships because support told me there is no way to get the access token for the user when using memberships, and I need access token because I don't want to use API key on the frontend."

I'm wondering if anyone has experience using the Marketing API to send Marketing Events for when a user takes an action on a web app.\n\nI have a 7 part email series that introduces users to our platform, but I only want to trigger the next email in the workflow after the user meets certain criteria. For example we would only send email 2 if the user has logged in, email 3 if they viewed a certain page, email 4 if they clicked a button.\n\nWe have Marketing Pro (not Ops Pro) so I am restricted with the Marketing API, hence would (I assume) need to configure the Register and / or Attend values for each event.\n\nAnyone configured something similar with Marketing API before?",

You can see for example that this deal has 3 tasks. I don't have to retrieve their ID's separately. If you need all notes, emails, and tasks you can just make an array with ID's of the activities.\nBut if you're referring to the part where you have to fetch data for those ID's after you got them, for that I think you'll have to make separate calls.
