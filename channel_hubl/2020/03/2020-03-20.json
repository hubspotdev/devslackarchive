It would be a huge improvement to the experience when plowing through documentation."

Using the drag and drop editor with custom modules for both.\n\nWhat I'm using is a repeating page field to select the pages that I want listed. From there, I can grab the page title and page URL no problem. However, on those pages are custom modules. I'd like to also display that content in this listing.\n\nCode for the basic premise is this:\n\n```{% for item in module.team_members %}\n   &lt;div class=\"item\"&gt;\n      {% set my_content = content_by_id(item) %}\n      &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ my_content.absolute_url }}\"&gt;{{ my_content.name }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n      {{ module.name_and_title }}\n      {{ module.bio }}\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}```\nWhat do I need to do to get this to work?",
