    "text": "Hi everyone! :wave: I’m facing an issue with integrating a form designed in Webflow with HubSpot, and I’m hoping someone here can share a suggestion.\nIn Webflow, we designed the form as shown in this image (see the section *\"Would you like to receive specific information?\"*). Each option, like \"Shift Management\" or \"Time Tracking,\" is configured as checkboxes in Webflow. This form is linked to a HubSpot form, where the corresponding field is created as *\"Single-line text.\"*\nThe problem is that when someone fills out the form and selects any of these checkboxes, HubSpot only receives \"On\" instead of the specific value of the selected option (e.g., \"Shift Management,\" \"Time Tracking,\" etc.). This prevents us from knowing the exact information chosen by the user.\nWe tried configuring this field as a checkbox group directly in HubSpot, but we struggled to customize the design to meet our needs: splitting the options into two columns and rounding the corners.\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how to solve this? We need a way to receive the detailed information about the selected options in HubSpot from the Webflow form.\nThanks in advance for any suggestions or solutions you can share! :raised_hands:",
