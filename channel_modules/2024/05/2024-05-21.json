    "text": "Hi Conor:\n\nThank you for reaching out. I have been working with my team to get more information and appreciate your willingness to help. A sample CTA is included below.\n\nOur dev lead reported the following: \"Bad news - that CTA link (the one at the bottom of <http://worthybonds.com/media|worthybonds.com/media>) redirects to our sign up page after passing it through to the domain <http://cta-service-cms2.HubSpot.com|cta-service-cms2.HubSpot.com>. We would need to find a way to pass a parameter to that CTA that it would then include in the redirect to worthy.capital. (recall that worthy.capital is our app and where visitors from <http://worthybonds.com|worthybonds.com> go to purchase bonds.\"\n\nHe continues, \"After more digging I found that I can rewrite everything that's on the landing page to include the ?r={value} (this is our backend identifier that provides attribution on our systems) but I can't do that with the CTA's because HubSpot hosts those on a different domain, then includes them on the page in an iframe. This means I can't use javascript on <http://worthybonds.com|worthybonds.com> to change the link's href because it's technically on a different domain and the browser won't allow it.\"\n\nHis question, \"If it's somehow possible for us to include our own custom javascript to use the postMessage API as described here:\n <https://www.perplexity.ai/search/using-javascript-is-KzHUCepZTR6.5R2RdsW5Lg> I think it's doable. Otherwise, we just don't have a way to modify content in an iframe where the source is on another domain, unfortunately.  Could we pose this question to their devs and see?\"\n\nI hope this provides the context that you are looking for and, again, I appreciate your assistance."
