I have a marketing request about email engagement for emails sent through `Amazon SES`, i did it easily with Zapier but it doesn't let me update the engagement events tracking (email open, click on links). I wish if there is possibile to do email event tracking in anyway with HubSpot API or with sending emails through HubSpot API, the emails contain a lot of attachments because we are sending contracts with them too. Thank you."
