    "text": "Hello everyone, don’t know if this is the right place to ask but here goes. I am working on a HubSpot app and have a CORS issue on the redirect authorization url when going through the frontend.  The project structure is NextJs on the frontend and NestJs on the backend. If I simply use the api url the flow works fine, but if I try from the frontend I get the CORS error on the authorization url. Any other api calls work fine after I manually do the oauth flow. Any thoughts ? Didn’t find anything online that could help, also the implementation is similar to the sample-oauth project from the HubSpot github."
