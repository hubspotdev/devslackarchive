    "text": "Hey everyone, I'm looking into ticket migration information specifically from Zendesk to HubSpot.\n\nThe only way to retain a ticket's thread messages is through it JSON export, and if my knowledge is correct, only way to import the data into HubSpot is through a CSV/XLS/XLSX format.\nI also know of the <https://help-desk-migration.com/> service that was referred to by our HubSpot CSM.\n\nI was just unsure on how the JSON data can be securely converted in any of HubSpot's data formats, does the help desk migration service contain that conversion feature? Or is there is something about the process that I may be missing?"
