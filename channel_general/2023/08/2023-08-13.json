We have seen the syntax for \"does contain\"\n Workflow\n - To ensure the workflow is set to activated we use the syntax \"enabled\": true, This is not throwing an error, however the workflow is not created. Without this syntax the WF is created, but it is not activated.\n - Please provide the syntax for the WF action to send a published marketing email. We have trailed a few, but have not succeeded.\n\n Below is the script we have used to create the WF, for clarification.\n {\n \"name\": `TEST WORKFLOW`,\n \"type\": \"STATIC_ANCHOR\",\n \"enabled\": true,\n \"onlyEnrollsManually\": false,\n \"segmentCriteria\": [\n [{\n \"operator\": \"CONTAINS\",\n \"value\": \"test-contains\",\n \"property\": \"nombre_maestro_individual\",\n \"type\": \"string\"\n }]\n ],\n \"eventAnchor\": {\n \"staticDateAnchor\": \"08/25/2023\"\n },\n \"actions\": [\n {\n \"type\": \"EMAIL\",\n \"id\": \"111535476571\"\n },\n ]\n }"
