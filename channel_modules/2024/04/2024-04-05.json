(this feature is SO helpful!)\n\nBut when I select a Popup CTA in the page editor as the link type, this HubSpot provided snippet will not work to render a link to open Popup properly\n\nI removed the |escape_url filter and now it works. It seems that this automatically generated snippet has not been tested properly with the new Popup CTAs feature. The |escape_url filter removes the javascript required by HubSpot tracking to properly render the CTA",
