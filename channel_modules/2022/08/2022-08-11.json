I'm new to this specific slack account and I have a question regarding an account I'm working on!\n\nI'm working on a site header and the logo link is linking to the preview page rather than the content staging page. Everything in settings and the branding guide is set to the content staging. But the logo in the header is pulling the preview link from somewhere, and I don't know where it is sourcing this. Could someone help with this? Thanks :relaxed:",
