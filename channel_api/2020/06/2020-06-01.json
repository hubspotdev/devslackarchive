But you should be able to make a good guess if you look at the code generation (<https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs/tree/master/codegen>), the Sample apps (<https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-nodejs/tree/master/sample-apps>) and the already implemented tests (Search for all dockerfiles)."
