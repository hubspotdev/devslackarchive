Besides the default \"name\" and \"description\" etc...\nI know you can you add modules to blog post pages to have extra information and fields on the specific blog pages. But if i have a section on another page (like the Home page or About page) that lists out all the \"posts\" I would like to have more than just the default fields that come with the posts.\nFor Example\n```{{ blog_recent_posts(\"default\", 5) }}\n\n{% set rec_posts = blog_recent_posts(\"default\", 5) %}\n\n{% for rec_post in rec_posts %}\n&lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Default Name field --&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"post-title\"&gt;{{ rec_post.name }}&lt;/div&gt; \n\n    &lt;!-- Hypothetical added fields --&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;{{ rec_post.subtitle }}&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;{{ rec_post.extra_field_added_here }}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}```",
