    "text": "Hi everyone, :wave:\n\nI’m working on a *custom CRM card* in HubSpot and need some help implementing a dynamic solution. Here’s what I’m trying to achieve:\n• I have an *Event object* in HubSpot, and each event is associated with *Contacts* who attended.\n• I want to create a button (via a CRM card) on the Event record that dynamically generates a *link to a filtered Contact view* showing all attendees for that specific event.\n• The goal is that when users open the Event record and click the button, they’re taken to a HubSpot Contact view filtered by the Event ID and the \"Attendee\" association label.\n*Example*:\n• Let’s say I open *Event X*. \n• When I click the button, it should take me to a Contact view where I see all Contacts associated with *Event X* as \"Attendees.",
