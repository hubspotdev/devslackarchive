It may take some extra tricks in some cases, but remember you’re not the customer, the marketers are their customers. Using HubSpot gives them a ton of really impressive tools that you can’t get on most platforms. \n\nDesign Manager 2 also solves a lot of the problems us developers have had with the platform\n\nThey’re showing that while we’re probably always going to be second class citizens to the marketers, they realize to make the platform truly grow they need developers on board. \n\nAnd think about it anyways, Developers should always be second class to the clients themselves.\n\nWho’s the one paying for the work? Who’s the one who’s ultimately responsible for using it?"

Which means to us that there will be constant iterations, constant review of functionality and UX. It was frustrating when I started to build out a site that the process of developing  in sandbox and testing iterations and building on more functionality to a site wasn't that clear.\nAnyways, I'm sure i'll get use to it and get onboard. It seems to be a good community and finding this slack channel the other day was a huge relief in itself. Now how to get my dev team onboard... lol"
