    "text": "Hello guys, warm greetings; I have a question regarding the development of an app for HubSpot. I'm a FullStack developer with NestJS, MongoDB, and Angular, specializing in backend development. I have a system that I want to convert into an internal app for HubSpot, the catch is that I'm not sure where to start, as I want to transfer the entire frontend as if it were a app from the HubSpot Marketplace. Could you please give me some advice on how to get started or which HubSpot Academy course to take? Many thanks in advance.",
