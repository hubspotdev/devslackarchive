That is actually another character and is often handled differently.\n\nMost likely one of these two things, or both of them, causes the error. The first one you have to fix anyway, because otherwise you're setting instead of comparing, the second one is my guess why you get the syntax error as it isn't interpreted as a string (which should be encapsulated within normal double quotes)",
