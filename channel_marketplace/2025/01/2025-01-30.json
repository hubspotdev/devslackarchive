    "text": "For clarity, this Twitter Integration and the Twitter integration thats part of HubSpot's core offerings are one and the same.\n\nIf you look at the details, HubSpot is the provider and the setup guide points to our KB article on connecting Twitter <> HubSpot.\n\n_Most_ of HubSpot's connections to third party tools have integration pages within our Marketplace. It merely adds an additional layer of discoverability to the connection, but clicking \"Install\" actually directs you to the Social Settings page where you can connect accounts and create posts.\n\nLong story short, it's really just a placeholder/slightly easier to find touchpoint for connecting Twitter.\n\nAs for this:\n\n> Does it also imply that anyone can create the UI equivalent of this Twitter app using UI extensions? I'm asking because I'm interested in creating a Bluesky integration and want to know how far I can go in terms of emulating the existing Social media capabilities?\nIf you're planning to list something like this on the marketplace, I'd highly recommend reaching out/joining our App Partner program: <https://www.HubSpot.com/partners/app/join> this team will help you determine if what you're looking to build is something that _could be_ listed. That said, as long as what you build adheres to these requirements: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/apps/marketplace/app-marketplace-listing-requirements> the world is pretty much your oyster here."
