    "text": "Hi Guys, For a contact, the custom property 'main deal record id' (indicating the most recently associated deal) was updated to `XXXXXXXX016` on *July 10th*, replacing the previous ID, `XXXXXXXX826`. However, when an order was associated with this contact on *October 16th*, my workflow’s custom code should have retrieved the latest 'main deal record ID'  to associate with the order. But when I retrieved it via the API, it returned `XXXXXXXX826` instead. Any idea why this discrepancy occurred?\n\nhere is my code FYI\n\nconst getContactDealId = async (contactId) => {\n  try {\n    const response = await HubSpotClient.crm.contacts.basicApi.getById(contactId,['main_deal_record_id'])\n\n    return response.properties?.main_deal_record_id;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error fetching contact:', error.message);\n    return null;\n  }\n};"

    "text": "Hey Everyone! Im new to HubSpot and have a use-case I wanted to discuss:\n\n*Context*:\nWe have a website that sells online products and based on user interactions with our website (signups, purchases, product usages, etc) we segment them into different buckets. These interactions are essentially Kafka events that are consumed and further processed based on our business logic (segmentation, cross-sell, etc)\n\nNow, we use these segments to do a lot of cool stuff, one of which is to create marketing campaigns and then send out email communication. And we are hoping to integrate HubSpot for this purpose.\n\n*Question*:\nIs it wiser to import all our segment information into HubSpot and then create marketing campaigns there?\n-OR-\nIs there are way to import Kafka events directly into HubSpot and create segments and then campaigns there?"
