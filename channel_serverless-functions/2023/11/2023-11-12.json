I'm stuck on a fairly simple \"create a new note in a deal\" API call.\n\nThe error I get is; \"invalid from object type 0-46 for associations to be created. expected: 0-2\"\n\nI guess i'm using the wrong association id but I can seem to figure out the correct one: tried 2, 213, ...\n\nAny help would be much appreciated! :pray:",
