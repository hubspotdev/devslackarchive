    "text": "Hi, I have a question with regards to reCaptcha and bot related spam-prevention: Apparently, HubSpot does not offer a really good instance to prevent bots from submitting forms. We have seen an increase in bot submissions which is obviously not what anyone wants. I read that there might be few workarounds, including creating a property field for the form where a user needs to do a simple match calculation. Another way would be using code (which is not really an option for us) and thirdly, to create a hidden field with a specific logic. This field would then only be visible for bots and not humans and once filled out by a bot, the logic would prevent the form from being submitted. If anyone knows how to create the third option, that would be immensely appreciated :)",

    "text": "Hey Carter, thanks for your response :slightly_smiling_face: I read the thread of that specific case you are referring to and it seems to be as if you only make the form field invisible by using some CSS. However, the question remains how to prevent the form submission if this hidden field is triggered/filled out by a bot. I could not find anything on how to combine the hidden field with some logic that would stop bots from submitting the form once the hidden field is filled out. Tbh I am not even sure if this whole \"honeypot\" thing is actually possible in HubSpot. The more I think about the more issues arise: 1: For example, even if I make a field hidden, the bots do not need to fill it out unless it is required - but even if the field is made invisible for a human, how can the form then be submitted if it is a required field? 2: and also, how to link the field with a logic so that once filled out by a bot it cannot be submitted. So, just to be clear (I know my message might be bit confusing), these are are mainly the 2 questions that I have to solve this bot submission problem."
