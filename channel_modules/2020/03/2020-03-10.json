    "text": "Hey all, I’m trying to use <https://marketplace.HubSpot.com/products/HubSpot/meetings|HubSpot’s meeting module> but it brings the meeting tool in through an iframe not allowing me to style it. <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/meetings-tool/embed-the-meeting-widget-on-a-page|I found this>, saying it can only be styled in the brand settings, however this is for a client and the form needs to be a different color than their brand.\n\nI feel like that can’t be the case as the page advertising it shows two different gradients being used in the gallery, both of which are different from the default slate color."
