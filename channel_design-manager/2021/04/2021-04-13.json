I really need your help on this.\nDoes anyone know where I can find the files for the standard quote templates?\nIn the default-theme I cloned you only have the basic one, but I cant seem to find \"Standard: modern\". Anyone know where I should look for these? I am implementing some small changes, and hope I wont have to replicate the entire template to do so :confused: :pray:",

I might be wrong.\n\nFor development, I would look in to <#CLJJXGTC0|local-development> if delay is an issue. Might make some processes easier for you :slightly_smiling_face: Hope this helped!"
