We're a small team, so in order to get those other items done we had to pause on Developer Day.\n\nThat said, ya'll could definitely organize sooooomething. We can help facilitate where possible. :slightly_smiling_face:\nI'd imagine without an official \"Developer Day\" happening, there won't be many developers attending INBOUND this year.\n\nWe're also exploring the possibility of doing a virtual event (to be inclusive to anyone, anywhere) in Q4 after INBOUND. But really depends on how those other initiatives are going."

Beer idea is just to be fun and make it more welcoming. If someone abused it we’d just kick em out. doubt there’d really be issues. Inbound is a professional event.\n\nIf HubSpot feels it’s too expensive to do, could probably get a partner agency to sponsor it",
