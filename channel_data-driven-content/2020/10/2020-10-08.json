    "text": "Hello dear HubSpoters,\nI’m having this problem with a dynamic page generated from a hubdb. The sitemap generated by HubSpot is indexing URLs which do not exist in the actual dynamic page system.\nFor example :\nThis is the working URL build from hubdb :\n<https://www.raisonhome.com/fr/cuisinistes-concepteurs/cuisiniste-grand-nancy-luneville-toul>\nOn this page there is a link to an asset from another hubdb table, an associated production of the entry (relational table) :\n<https://www.raisonhome.com/fr/realisations/cuisine-ferm%C3%A9e-contemporain-bois-beige-NANCY-Corentin-CELKA-147287>\nThis URL is dynamically build from the relational table.\nThe problem is that the HubSpot site generator is unable to make the dynamic correlation between the two tables. Here is an example of the URL generated in the sitemap :\n<https://www.raisonhome.com/fr/cuisinistes-concepteurs/cuisiniste-brest-guipavas-landerneau/cuisine-ferm%C3%A9e-contemporain-bois-beige-NANCY-Corentin-CELKA-147287>\nThe  sitemap adds “/cuisiniste-brest-guipavas-landerneau/” before the actual slug of the live page “cuisine-ferm%C3%A9e-contemporain-bois-beige-NANCY-Corentin-CELKA-147287\". It seems that the sitemap thinks that the dynamic page is “child” of the “parent” page.\nAny idea ?\nThanks",

    "text": "<@UR2RMQ8E4> Why do u need child table here in the  table `Franchisés-FR`? If you use child table, page generation will behave like <https://designers.HubSpot.com/how-to-build-multilevel-dynamic-templates|multilevel dynamic pages> so you are seeing such urls in sitemap. Since you are creating some thing that is not multi-level pages, do not use child table id column at all.."
