    "text": "Hey Denise,\nMy use case currently is very simple. I am just creating a new Deal Pipeline that has some added workflows. Mainly notifications and task creation. Nothing too fancy.\nObviously it would had been easier to just push the changes I did in sandbox into production but I can recreate all of it in a matter of hours.\nBut in case you want to talk happy to talk sometime first half of january (I won't work much anymore this year)."
