    "text": "Hi everyone :slightly_smiling_face:\nHas someone here successfully implemented a Webpack bundle, which utilizes code splitting via dynamic imports?\n\nThe problem we run into is, that webpack expects all chunks to reside in the same folder, and for them to have the .js (not .min.js) extension.\nWhen we upload the theme via the cli, the chunks are located in different paths, because the CDN URLs contain two ids, which are sometimes different from file to file.\nIs there some option to force the cli to upload all files to the same folder?\nI also commented on an existing issue in the\ncms-react-boilerplate repo: <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react-boilerplate/issues/14>",
