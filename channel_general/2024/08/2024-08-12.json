    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI’m working on building a module in HubSpot CMS for our software, and I could use some advice. The module is essentially a table that displays features available for different subscription tiers. Each row should have a varying number of checkmarks (e.g., one, two, or three) under the corresponding tier.\nI’m currently running into an issue with my implementation. Specifically, when I try to apply checkmarks to a specific tier, they end up appearing in all the rows. Here's the code I’m working with:\n```<div class=\"new_features__additional-section\">\n  {% for item in module.new_feature_text %}\n    <div class=\"new_features__info-box\">\n      <div class=\"new_features__info-text\">{% inline_text field=\"new_feature_text\" value=\"{{ item }}\" %}</div>\n      {% for item in module.checkmark_amount %}\n        <div class=\"new_features__checkmark-container\">\n          <div class=\"new_features__checkmark-area\">\n            <svg class=\"new_features__icon\">\n              <use href=\"#checkmark\"></use>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      {% endfor %}\n    </div>\n  {% endfor %}\n</div>```\nDoes anyone have suggestions on how to improve this? I need to ensure that checkmarks are applied correctly to each row based on its specific tier, rather than applying the checkmarks globally.",
