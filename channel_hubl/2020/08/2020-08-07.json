You can key it all off of the URL for each link if you want. Then you can have fields for links / content / images / icons etc.  - I just finished a build like this a few months back and it worked really well. And is “easy” to edit later on. But the hubDB table can get a little bit cumbersome"

The follow up email is not sending though, and I don't see why. Does anyone have a clue as to why the email is not following up the form submission?",
