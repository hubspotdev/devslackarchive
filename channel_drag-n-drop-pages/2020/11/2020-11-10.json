    "text": "Hi there, i've got a question concerning the conversion from a bootstrap sliced website to HubSpot. I'm trying to implement the DND areas and sections to enable end users to add their own rows of content. The thing i'm stuck with is the limitation of available options for sections and columns. I see no possibility to add classes to them, which is very important for us, because those classes style the contents in the columns.\n\nThe second problem is when i dynamically add columns by dropping modules in them. There seems to be a handle for changing the column width, but dragging the handle does not do anything. The width stays based on the width of the content. Any idea how we can solve this?",
