    "text": "That would 100% depend on what their app is that they want to integrate, and how much stuff they want to migrate into HubSpot directly right now.\n\nFor example: a bank typically has an <http://app.bankname.com|app.bankname.com> site for the logged-in experience because they will use a proprietary system for banking. But their website would be hosted fully on HubSpot. In that scenario they could even get away with CMS Hub Free.\n\nIf the use-case is something like a learning management system, you could build it fully in CMS Hub Enterprise.\n\n*What’s their app do?*"
