    "text": "have a customer that is wanting to selectively hide some files in the `Attachments` card of HubSpot .. the reason is that they have some files that have private information (e.g. account numbers etc.) and don't want everyone that has access to a record see that document ..is this possible OOTB using HubSpot? What options are there to solve for such a use case? I am thinking of a UX extension that replaces the standard attachment card with something that has rules that can drive the visibility of the document. Any other ideas?"
