Gagan is correct that you can't migrate \"immutable\" timeline data, but otherwise you can all the usual properties, including engagements (notes, calls, meetings, emails, etc.).  The app will be launched in the App Marketplace at the end of May, but if you want early access let me  know.  The one-time migration fee is $499."
