    "text": "Hi all! I am new here. I just started with HubSpot CMS for Developers cert and I am unsure about my setup. When I run `npm install -g @HubSpot/cli` nothing showed up in my project folder in VS Code. I found some help in HubSpot forum and run:\n\n```1 npm init\n \n2 npm install @HubSpot/cli\n \n3 npx hs init```\nAnd only then I got `package.json` in my folder, and after confirming my account key I got the `HubSpot.config.yml` file.\nIt looks different than the setup Jeff had in the video, where there was `package-lock.json` file and the `node-modules` folder.\nCan someone please confirm that my setup is correct?\nI don’t know why node-modules folder didn’t show up here. I was able to install the test theme through this command  `npx @HubSpot/create-cms-project test-theme` so it looks like everything is fine, but I’d rather double-check.",
