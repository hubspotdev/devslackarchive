    "text": "The issue is that if you try to modify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` , you might risk to open it to everyone, and this is generally a bad idea even with truly serverless solutions like AWS Lambda, as it might be discovered by third parties and abuse it.\nOn AWS you can use different and more complex solution to alleviate that, like adding WAF on top of them, but you should see the HubSpot serverless functions as a simpler way to use that technology, without worrying all the security implications, hence the need to restrict it in some way."
