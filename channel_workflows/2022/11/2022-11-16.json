I know the fuzzy match will likely require a 3rd party tool, but I can't find a way to associate two records in HubSpot with a basic automation.  Am I missing something?  What's the easiest way to solve this?\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the end goal is to assign the ticket to the owner of the custom object.  Basically the custom object is a lookup tool for who should be assigned the ticket based on field data in the service request.",
