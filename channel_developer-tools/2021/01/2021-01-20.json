I have look for a way to do it with the PHP client library, but I can not find a way to do it. I also need to create the association with contact and this new customObject.\nIs theres a way to interact with Custom Objects with this client library ?\nAs Custom objects are new concepts in HubSpot, maybe this feature will come soon in this client library ?",
