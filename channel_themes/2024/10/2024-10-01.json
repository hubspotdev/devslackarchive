Custom object to Custom object works fine, it's just the default objects that can't be shown on public pages per HubSpot:\n_Please note: for security purposes, of the <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/crm-setup/get-started-with-objects#standard-objects|HubSpot standard object types> only the `product`, and `marketing_event` objects can be retrieved on a publicly accessible page. Any other standard object type must be hosted on a page which is either <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/cos-pages-editor/how-can-i-password-protect-my-pages|password protected> or requires a <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/articles/kcs_article/cms-pages-editor/control-audience-access-to-pages|CMS Membership login>. Custom objects do not have this same restriction._"
