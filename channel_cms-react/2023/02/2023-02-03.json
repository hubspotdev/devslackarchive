    "text": "Hello Andrey! I did some digging around and apparently there is a feature/experiment now where if you edit the Page URL of a page and set the content slug to\n\n```page-name/[:dynamic-slug]```\nYou get 4 levels of resolution to that page so for example...\n\n```page-name/test\npage-name/level1/level2\npage-name/level1/level2/level3\n...```\nWill all resolve to that page. I'm going to experiment with ReactRouter to see about nuances with SSR and pre-rendering. But I wanted to alert you to this information."
