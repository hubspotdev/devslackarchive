We use HubL to make text and images changeable through the email editor in HS.\n\nWe always test our emails using HubSpot’s test previews.\n\nregarding sample emails I’ll have to talk to my boss about what we’re allowed to show due to NDA’s with our clients.\n\nIf you are interested feel free to DM me and we can discuss the timeline for your current projects and move on from there"
