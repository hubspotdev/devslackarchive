    "text": "Hi guys! related to background images in modules, it happens that if I’m using the same module in the same page, the background gets overridden because is using the same class. It’s kind of a weird behaviour, but I wanted to know your approach on that.\n\nWhat do you do with small/large device background images? Do you fetch the images from the CMS into inline style?\n\nHappy to hear from you and different opinions on this topic.\n\nthis is what I currently do :point_down:",
