We changed our branding and domain in HS a few months ago and the i just noticed that our tracking URLs using old domain are not working anymore (it's quite obvious why) and i can't seem to setup redirect for those URLs either coz HubSpot says that original URL domain is not hosted in HubSpot. What's the best solution to reactivate/re-enable those links if any?"
