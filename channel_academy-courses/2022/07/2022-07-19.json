For some reason, when I create a new page using a newly-created template, in the template preview specifically, I am seeing the desired outcome (header background color) BUT NOT after Iâ€™ve actually created the page. Does anyone have any ideas as to why? I am also experiencing the same issue with getting my footer to appear. Would greatly appreciate the help!",
