Address your authorities by media and rallies. We need a ban on SWIFT and full isolation for Russian economy to stop money flow to its military. We need help to cover our sky. And, Ukraine needs more weapons.\n2. :moneybag:Donate to the Ukrainian army any amount of money would make a difference. The National Bank of Ukraine made a special account for donations. Here’s a link\n<https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi>\n3. :loudspeaker: Spread the word with your audience using any channel you have to tell the world what Russia is doing to its neighbor. A lot of famous people are already doing that Sean Pen (who’s currently in Ukraine), Angelina Jolie, Madonna, etc.\n\nPlease stand with Ukraine.\nWe haven’t asked for this war but we will defend ourselves as it’s a fundamental human right.\n:pray:\n\nP.S. Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation has officially reached out to Apple to halt App Store for Russia.\n<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-25/ukraine-urges-apple-to-cease-product-sales-app-store-in-russia>\n\nIf only HubSpot could do the same to stop war criminals on all fronts :crossed_fingers:"
