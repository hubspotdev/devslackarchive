Would it be possible to map Sales Stage(A property in Vtiger that can be move to different stages) to Deal stage in HubSpot. When the Sales stage changes in Vtiger for example it would update in HS with the respective changes to deal stage I hope for.. I notice all integrations using the API seemed to use Zapier and I could not find a way as yet in Zapier....."

The deal stage value can be changed to via the this endpoint <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/deals/update_deal> and you can get what the possible stage values are from this endpoint <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/pipelines/get_pipelines_for_object_type>.  What you need to do is stand up a piece of middleware that translates between how Vtiger puts information out and how HubSpot expects it. Normally this the role that Zapier would play but it’s possible they haven’t implemented the pipelines API, I haven’t checked"
