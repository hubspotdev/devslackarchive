    "text": "Hi all,\nI'm using the new style_fields to update a custom button; before I had put some settings in \"content\" that now I wanted to insert in the new \"style\" tab but, while before, editing in the page and clicking on the \"style\" tab I could hide or display the module  (in this case the button) for desktop and/or mobile, now, if I insert my styles with the new method, I don't find anymore the possibility to hide or display the module as I did before.\nHow can I insert the possibility, as it was before, to display or hide my module between desktop and mobile?\nThanks",
