I.e. it's just the default association defined in the CO schema (CO is built through the HS interface rather than API)?\n\nTo illustrate, when I've defined an association label, I can find its ID in the URL when editing the label (see screenshot). But if there's no label defined, it seems the only way to find it is by calling the Read Association Schema endpoint. Is there no quicker way?",

You will get the necessary credentials to install those apps which can then be installed in any HubSpot account using the Oauth flow.  For the purposes of testing those apps you can also create test accounts from your developer account.
