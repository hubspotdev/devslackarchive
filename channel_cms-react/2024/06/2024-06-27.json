    "text": "Hi guys, I’ve been having issues lately with modules that passed all tests and worked correctly for two HubSpot accounts, but when I move them to the third account, which is Production, the behavior is different.\n\nFor reference, we use the main account as production and have two sandboxes.\n\nThe problem we’re having now is with the GlobalSearch. The behavior in the sandboxes is correct, but in the main account, the module doesn’t work well. However, if I add the parameter `hsDebug=true`, the behavior is as expected.\nWe have already tried redeploying all the modules, and I also tried adding this to the template: `{% set path = request.query %}`, but somehow it remains cached.\n\nThis is *URGENT* because we are going to production today, and we have no way to solve this error.\nDoes anyone have any idea what might be happening? Thanks in advance\n\nCC: <@U06GSRMB84C>",
