I noticed this too and then I stumbled upon a small line in the documentation that says that a HubSpot Module acts like a dnd_column. so what you would like to have is a different structure.\n\nThe following structure should do the trick:\n\n```section\n -row\n --module\n --module\n -end_row\nend-secton```"
