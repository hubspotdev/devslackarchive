HS also have a feature to send custom JSON responses too, which I will be using in due course to only send the info needed instead of the entire user profile. This should work for us and make it easier to manage as well as not having over 300 enrolment triggers on a single workflow which causes browser tabs to lock up due to the amount of things there."
