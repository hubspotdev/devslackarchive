    "text": "Hello, I have developed a HubSpot app which utilizes CRM Account Extension. The app works most of the time and I am able to create invoice most of the time. But in some cases I get error messages during invoice creation. The error messages shown on the invoice creation screen are like \"There was a problem loading your data\" or \"There was a problem searching your products\". The CRM Accounting extension's webhook response is being served by a Python code based server that uses \"HubSpot-api-client\" Python library. When I check the log of the Python server I do not see any error message reported when error is thrown on the HubSpot invoice creation process. Does HubSpot have any API endpoint or some developer panel to see more details of such error messages related an App's webhook response during invoice creation process?",
