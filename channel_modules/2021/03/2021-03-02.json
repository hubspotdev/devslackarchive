    "text": "Hi guys, I'm new here. But had a question and hoping this is the best place to ask. I'd like to create (or use if it already exists)  a module that allows continuous image uploading within a defined space.\n\nBasically, we have a partners page and are creating custom icons that are the logos for each partner to keep the design consistent. Something like my attached image for reference.\n\nI want to use or create a module that will allow me to upload these icons/images into the same area while keeping the layout consistent. So when new partners are added, the team can just use the module to upload the new icon and have it appear in place after the last icon without having to worry about styling or anything else.\n\nAny ideas how I can achieve this?",
