    "text": "*Hi there :)*\nIm facing an issue with HubSpot script inside of react app, and wondering if someone here could help…\nIn short: I have react app, with HubSpot script embedded inside the index.js file. \nI can see the script itself when running the app in the browser, \nSince react is a single-page app, the source code inside of the index.html will be fired only once, in the initial rendering of the app, meaning when the user visit the first URL inside the app, and not when navigating to any other pages inside the app.\nThe problem that it causes is that leads go in HubSpot only if the user fill this input in the first page he visits. \n\nFor example, a user visit <http://joonko.co|joonko.co> and submitting a form - the leads go into HubSpot.\nBut if the case is: a user visit <http://joonko.co|joonko.co> and then navigating to <http://joonko.co/talent-stream|joonko.co/talent-stream> and only then submitting a form - the leads will not go into HubSpot\n\nReally important to note - we are using history.push (react-router-dom) to navigate between pages."
