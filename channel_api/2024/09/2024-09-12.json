It's crazy that there isn't some way to stop certain portal ids from sending webhook events through the developer app config page, or to force uninstall an app from a portal to stop receiving them.\n\nI'm aware the portalId is in the body of the event but in that instance it requires that we still have to process it before we can decide to dump the event, and in some instances for old customers with large HubSpot instances, we could be receiving 75,000 events a day that we have to pay to start to process before we can decide to dump them based on their portalId."

I needed a custom code to retroactively find the deal stage prior to becoming closed lost.\n\nI used chatgpt to write this.  It reads a deal and finds the 2nd most recent deal stage.  I use the internal value and map that on a branch with the deal stages populating a new property that I called \"Deal Stage before Closed Lost\"\n\nPlease take a glance and let me know if it is overboard or if this is what you would come up with.  I have run it, it works just fine, but again, I'm technical enough to know how to trouble shoot using chatgpt and api docs, but I'm not a true developer.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated, thanks!\n\n`// Import the required modules`\nconst HubSpot = require('@HubSpot/api-client');\n\n// Initialize the HubSpot client with your access token\nconst HubSpotClient = new HubSpot.Client({ accessToken: 'INSERT API KEY' }); // Replace with your actual access token\n\n// Define the function to get the dealstage history for a specific deal\nexports.main = async (event, callback) => {\n  try {\n    // Get the deal ID (record ID) from the event or input\n    const hs_object_id = event.inputFields.hs_object_id; // Make sure you pass dealId as an input in your workflow\n\n    // Ensure the deal ID is a valid numeric value\n    if (!hs_object_id || isNaN(hs_object_id)) {\n      throw new Error(`Invalid deal ID: ${hs_object_id}.
