    "text": "Hey HubSpot Community,\n\nI've noticed a large drop in our email performance starting in June 2024. We've had several large clients tell use that our SPF records and DNS keys are not matching up within our email headers, which is HubSpot's responsibility since our records point back to theirs. Has anyone else noticed serious deliverability issues? Another issue popped up this morning and we were advised that it's a email header issue which HubSpot tags while being delivered. It's frustrating because its 100% out of our control.\n\nAny insight would be great appreciated!",
