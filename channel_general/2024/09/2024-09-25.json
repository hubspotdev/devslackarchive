    "text": "<@UQNEXHW14> it would be very helpful if HubSpot could give more detailed outage information.\n\nThe status page indicating \"Major Outage\" across the entire platform makes it seem as though we should not expect anything to be operational, but that doesn't appear to be the case.\n\nI think one of the most critical areas to provide more granular detail is in regards to the API, which with this particular outage seems to be very mixed. Some endpoints don't appear to have any issues, some seem to only be returning 400's, and others are spotty.\n\nProviding more detailed information both during outages and afterwards would help me communicate with stakeholders on various teams and inform the course of action.",
