I have been looking in to the requirements for being listed on the HubSpot Code gallery and I'm not sure that my repository makes sense for the structure or purpose of the Code Gallery. <http://HubSpot.NET|HubSpot.NET> is a client library for .NET applications to call the API directly for custom integrations.\n\nBased on what I was seeing in the accepted categories, I don't think we apply to the Gallery. Should I still go ahead and fill out an application?",
