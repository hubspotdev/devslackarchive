These events are triggered by clicking on a link, so maybe it doesn't get registered before the window navigates to the next page? That's all I can think of. Anyone have any idea what I might be doing wrong with this, or how to fix it? Or some other way I could track this so I can trigger some workflows?",

For example, a browser will complete its navigation to a new page ASAP and not wait for an ajax call to start or complete (odd results). But if you disable the default action on click, then do your push, and only if that completes (or you give it a timeout/proceed) then you can have the link continue."

If HubSpot is ever having an issue (or any api for that matter), you don't want to leave your users stuck on a given page just because a push notification failed. I typically put a 10-15 second timeout on anything like this. That's a really long time in web terms and if any type of basic push notification takes that long, something has gone terribly wrong IMO and the user should just move on with their journey."
