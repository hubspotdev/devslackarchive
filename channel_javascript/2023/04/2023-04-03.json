    "text": "hey folks! not sure if this is better here or in <#C2YHAHB6K|api>, but i’m using the forms api to submit a HubSpot form on this page (and redirect users into a quiz). it works fine the first time it’s done, but if you go back and try to submit the form again, what it usually does instead is refresh the page and append the email address to the url. i’m working through troubleshooting it, but figured i’d ask if other people have seen similar issues and how you solved it. here’s what i’m talking about on a staging site (and attaching a quick video of the issue happening): <https://appcues-staging-e7f79a27f044d1db1652ac3.webflow.io/plg-maturity-assessment>",
