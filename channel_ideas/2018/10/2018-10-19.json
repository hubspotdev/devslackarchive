I looked into it but my ReactFu isn’t as sophisticated as it needs to be to figure this out.\n\nHubSpot is using a React Port of code mirror. In order to get emmet working I have to figure out what the variable name is that is used for initializing codemirror.\n\nUnfortunately the react codemirror thing appears to kind of abstract it. So I can’t find it. If anyone can find that variable I think I have an okay chance of being able to get it to work"
