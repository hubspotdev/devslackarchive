Would they be good enough to serve their purpose? Not sure.\n\nGoogle does want to see them translated though: <https://www.seroundtable.com/google-translate-image-alt-tags-25133.html>\n\nI imagine it will also be helpful in making your content more accessible to those who benefit the most from alt tags.\n\nI’m following along because I’m curious if anyone has a good solution here. Unfortunately I don’t."
