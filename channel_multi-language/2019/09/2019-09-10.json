    "text": "Hi <@UHJM7AW02> :wave:\nAre you using Google Custom Search? If yes, I think you can set up specific parameters to search by language: <https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/site_restricted_api> &lt;&lt; There’s a link on that page which will take you to the parameters available, one of which is language.\nIf that’s not it, would you mind sharing a bit more info on the site you’re wanting to set this up for? Like is it a fully-hosted HubSpot site (if not, what CMS is it using), is it using TLDs, subdomains, or subdirectories for languages… If you can share an example URL, that could help."
