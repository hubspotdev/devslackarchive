Usually I'd display blog posts using the RSS module, but I'm not sure how I'd combine posts and static blocks",

On loop index 3 and 4 they insert the \"subscribe\" and \"free marketing resources\" CTAs.\n\nSeems like they also use loop index conditionals to insert classes on the blog post divs that control if they are one-third or two-third in size"
