It looks like you may not be passing anything in the body.\n\nFor that endpoint, you must pass product IDs in an array in the payload:\n```\n{\n  \"ids\": [\n    1645187,\n    1642796\n  ]\n}\n```\nThus, you have to know the product IDs already. You can get all product IDs from a `GET` request to this endpoint: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/products/get-all-products>."
