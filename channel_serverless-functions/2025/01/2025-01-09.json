    "text": "Hello,\nI hope you are doing very well.\nDoes\n anyone know how I can implement code that executes at a specific time? I\n was researching, and this can be done using a Node.js package called `cron`. I was looking into it, and in the `serverless.json` file, the following configuration is made:\n```{\n  \"appFunctions\": {\n    \"get-data\": {\n      \"file\": \"get-data.js\",\n      \"secrets\": []\n    }\n  },\n  \"schedules\": [\n    {\n      \"function\": \"get-data\",\n      \"cron\": \"0 12 * * *\"\n    }\n  ]\n}```\nWhat Iâ€™m not sure about is whether this will work and if the infrastructure that HubSpot has will allow for it.\nI would appreciate it if someone could help me with this question.\nThank you.",
