I’ve tried\n```styles={\n  border: {\n    border_radius: 10\n  }\n},```\nI’m pretty sure that format is right, I think the only thing wrong is the path to `border_radius`. I’ve tried `border_radius`, `radius`, `corner`, `corner_radius`, and `border_corner_radius` but no luck yet though. Maybe it’s not possible for the image module… `styles={}` with margin and padding works though.",
