    "text": "Hey guys, I’m building a calculator in React and my current setup looks like this:\n-- partial with App?island;\n-- App (container for all the other components)\n---- SliderInput1\n---- SliderInput2\n---- SliderInput3\n---- Results\n\nThis works fine, I’m lifting state up from the SliderInputs components to the App, where I made the calculations and I’m updating the Results component.\n\nMy next step was to make all the text of the calculator editable from the HubSpot Edit Page via a module or multiple modules. This is where I’m blocked. I was expecting an easy way to have modules in partials or an easy way to share module data between components in a partial.\n\nI tried to transform a SliderInput component into a module, but it’s losing the interactivity (slider range movement)."
