    "text": "Hello everyone.\n\nWhile trying to improve the performance and speed of a landing page, we encountered an issue that was highly prioritised in GTMetrix as, “Reduce initial server response time”!\n\nOne of the methods which were suggested was to reduce Time to First Byte (TTFB), also known as server response time.\n\nWe had contacted HS support, to which one of the support representatives said, “It may be worth looking into changing the TLS versions you support.., along with other domain security settings. Beyond that, there aren’t a ton of server-specific changes that you have authority to make in-app.”\n\nNow, my question is that does higher TLS facilitate in improved website performance?\n\nCare to weigh in..?",
