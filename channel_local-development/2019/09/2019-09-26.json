Add support for `.hsignore` file that will ignore files from being uploaded when using `hs upload` and `hs watch`\n3. Added support for `.yaml` extension for the config file\n4. Improved module `create` command so that by default css and js donâ€™t result in network requests for a file that only has comments\n\nRun `npm install -g @HubSpot/cms-cli@latest` to update your version and get access to these new features!",
