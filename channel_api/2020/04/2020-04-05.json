The contact record will be created in HS but HS cannot associate the contac record with the visitor’s website activity. So you’ll see the new contact record but not his/her page views that led up to that submission, nor the page activity afterwards. If you included the hutk, then all of that user’s anonymous activity on the site will be associated with the new user record."
