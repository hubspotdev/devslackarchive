This also includes document.referrer, good for privacy but it broke a few edge cases (iframes, iframed 3rd party payment gateways etc) <https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/>"

    "text": "<@U7D5W6EVA> <@U25PYL3Q8> Hi , I've been working on optimising our website for the last couple of days and this is one of the issues I've experienced. I found it was jQuery that was causing the issue as both of the versions HubSpot provides (1.7 and 1.11) are flagged as having security vulnerabilities by Google Lighthouse. I fixed the issue by disabling jQuery in HubSpot and then pulling in the most recent version of jQuery (v3.2) and jQuery migrate in the global header HTML section of website settings. I found the HubSpot grader didn't provide enough detail to allow me to actually diagnose the issues it flagged but it is powered by Google Lighthouse which is pretty good. You can access Google Lighthouse using chrome dev tools and going to audit which will give you a lot more information about the issues it finds including how to fix them. You can find more here: <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse> Hope this helps :slightly_smiling_face:"
