    "text": "This will generally always be a problem with distributed systems, especially with replication. You should ideally resolve this in your code by maintaining some sort of local reference of contacts created based on a unique id. If HubSpot returns a success respond with an ID when you create the contact - simply store in an local hashmap with email as identifier, or something similar.\n\nWhen you say search are you referring to the search endpoint? If so - this, i imagine is more likely to be slower to update as itâ€™ll be using a search index I imagine."
