    "text": "Hello! I am new to working with the serverless functions within HubSpot and I was wondering if anyone could help me navigate resolving an error that I received when I tried to run `hs secrets list` . This is the error I received:\n```[ERROR] A StatusCodeError has occurred. 403 - {\"status\":\"error\",\"message\":\"This app hasn't been granted all required scopes to make this call.
