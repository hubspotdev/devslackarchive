So the page would have to be super-simple. But once you get into repeatable fields, or anything remotely complicated, HubDB would be out the door.\n\nFor more complicated content, I’d use the page publishing api and try to access custom module fields for more complicated content via `widget_containers` and `widget_data`.\n\nThen, I’d look into transforming the HubSpot editor into a content reporting tool, so content editors could get a birds eye view of their content (it would just be another “backend” view in HubSpot’s editor). It’d be a lotta work and the client would have to really wanna fork out some dinero lol. I’m not even sure if it’s possible, but that is what I would play around with"
