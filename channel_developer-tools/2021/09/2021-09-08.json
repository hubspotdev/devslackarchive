    "text": "<@UD53A9UUR> so it turns out, the issue might be either a bug in the client or my misunderstanding of the documentation, particularly the `after` and `limit` params. As you can see, the following request works using curl:\n```\n  curl --request GET \\\n  --url '<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/deals/6139552033/associations/2-3155152?limit=500&amp;hapikey=>&lt;REDACTED&gt;'\n{\"results\":[{\"id\":\"309459790\",\"type\":\"customobj_to_deal\"}]}%```\nhowever, the following custom code returns a 500:\n```const HubSpot = require('@HubSpot/api-client');\n\nexports.main = (event) =&gt; {\n  const HubSpotClient = new HubSpot.Client({\n    apiKey: process.env.apiKey\n  });\n  \n  HubSpotClient.crm.deals.associationsApi.getAll(event.object.objectId, \"2-3155152\", 0, 500)\n    .then(results =&gt; {\n      console.log(results.body);\n    })\n    .catch(err =&gt; {\n      console.error(err);\n    });\n}```\nResponse:\n```body: {\n      status: 'error',\n      message: 'internal error',\n      correlationId: '2fc3b7e3-f5c7-441f-8502-e629c9235d61'\n    },\n    [Symbol(kCapture)]: false\n  },\n  body: CollectionResponseAssociatedId {\n    results: undefined,\n    paging: undefined\n  },\n  statusCode: 500```\nWhat is the best channel for this question?"
