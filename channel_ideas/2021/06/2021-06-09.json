    "text": ":corgi-wave: thanks for filing! We actually have the support in place for this in our API, we just haven’t updated our documentation yet. I’ll get the ball rolling on that this week. In the meantime, if you’d like to play around with this, you can add output fields to an action using our “update a custom action” endpoint, with an output field that looks like\n```{\n  \"outputFields\": [\n    {\n      \"typeDefinition\": {\n        \"name\": \"my_output_name\",\n        \"type\": \"string\" // or number, date, whatever\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}```\nAnd then you can return your outputs when the custom action executes by having your response body look like\n```{\n  \"outputFields\": {\n    \"my_output_name\": \"output value\"\n  }\n}```\nTo provide labels for the outputs there is a new entry in the `labels`, `outputFieldLabels`:\n```{\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"en\": {\n      \"actionName\": \"My action\",\n      // other labels\n      \"outputFieldLabels\": {\n        \"my_output_name\": \"My Output Name\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}```"
