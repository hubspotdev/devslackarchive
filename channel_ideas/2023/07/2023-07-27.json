Specifically, I am curious about whether the add-ins from Outlook automatically log all emails/contacts into HubSpot, without the need to manually add them from the add-in button. Can anyone provide some insights or guidance on how this can be achieved?\nLooking forward to your responses, and I appreciate any assistance you can provide.\nBest regards,"
