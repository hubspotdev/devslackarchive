Or basically, providing an action which requires user input. It seems to me I have to use the IFORM action. Does that mean I have to actually implement GUI on my web server, which will be just shown in HubSpot? Or is it possible to somehow define the data form, which HubSpot could interpret into a GUI? Something like confirmation hook action, but with custom data which would be then send to my web server. I would like to avoid creating my own GUI since I have no experience with frontend."
