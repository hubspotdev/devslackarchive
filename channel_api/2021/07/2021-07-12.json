    "text": "Hey everyone! \nWe're new to HubSpot and we’d love some help in trying to figure out what the best way would be to integrate our license generation system to our knowledgebase. \nWe want to integrate through REST API to a 3rd party service.\nSo the current program we're using uses cookies and cURL commands to log into the server then based on info submitted by the user it finds the CustomerId in the db.\nWe use read commands to enter different properties inserted by the user (on HubSpot it’ll be Form properties) and with them we change an updating XML file.\nWe create a fingerprint V2C file (a file which contains protected information about the license terms and data stored in deployed Sentinel protection keys).\nShould we go to OAuth or webhooks? Can webhooks be used to login to the 3rd party service and read POST request responses? I figure that a form can’t be updated live after a webhook is triggered so is an App required for this?",
