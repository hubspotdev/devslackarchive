    "text": "Hello team.\n\nI am facing a peculiar issue. After creating a child theme for one of my clients, the main theme pages have the same theme-override.css and main.css path as the child theme pages. So if I change field.json in the child, those are also reflected on the live page. We tried to use an absolute path to link the parent theme-override.css and the same for main.css files, but it is not working either. If we delete the child theme, CDN paths will go back to normal on live pages. What possibly am I doing wrong? On the other hand, in another test portal, it's working just fine, Like both child and parent theme pages have the right CDN paths that it has to be.\n\nDoes someone have any solution for this?"
