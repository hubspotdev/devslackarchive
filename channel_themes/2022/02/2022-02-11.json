    "text": "Am I able to use the value of a field in fields.json and apply it to the parent element? For example, if I create a Choice field, can the choices be CSS classes, and can that choice then be added to the parent element? The use case is that I have a bunch of :hover animations I want to use, and I have them coded as CSS classes. I want to take what the user has selected for a button as the hover class and add that class to the button. Then I would run a macro to retrieve the relevant CSS for that class and apply it to the selected user input.\n`button,`\n`.button {`\n `{{ button_font.style }}`\n`....etc`\n`}`\n\n`button:hover {`\n  `{{ background-color: {{ button_hover_bg_color }};`\n  `...etc`\n`}`\n\n`{{ hover_class }}:hover {`\n  `hoverclass({{ theme.buttons.hover.hover_class }});`\n`}`"
