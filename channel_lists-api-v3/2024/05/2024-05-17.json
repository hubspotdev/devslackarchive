    "text": "Hey all! Our team here at SyncSmart/Lynton are beginning work on transitioning our Contact Lists sync for MS Dynamics to V3 of the Lists endpoints.\n\n*We've noticed that the IDs of contact lists are different when using V3.* There does not appear to be any way to get a list's old ID except by manually fetching the record and looking at the value of `hs_classic_list_id`. I'd like for us to discuss solutions to this so that we can seamlessly make this transition while continuing to ensure customer success. As an integration developer, one of the worst things we can do is create duplicates, so more support for working with the \"classic\" list IDs is needed from you guys at HubSpot right now before we begin migrating our code. Thanks so much",
