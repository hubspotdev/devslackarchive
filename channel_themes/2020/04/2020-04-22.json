However, there may be some limitations if a customer updated a section background color as the colors may not match.\nIn addition, you’ll want to add some custom margin to each section to account for the added vertical space in the pseudo elements, and that may cause some confusion if a customer edits the spacing in their sections.\nOne other approach may be to create pngs that you can set as background images that give the desired appearance."
