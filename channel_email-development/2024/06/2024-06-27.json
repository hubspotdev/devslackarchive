    "text": "Hi! I'm new to this channel and was referred here by HS support. We are trying to find a way to bulk remove unwanted email associations with deal records. One of our users from our business development team sends out lots of one to one and sequence emails, but we don't need these on our deal record. We only need emails from the deal owner. I heard we may be able to code a custom way of automating the removal of these emails. We don't need to permanently delete them, just remove them from the deal record. Is this possible?",
