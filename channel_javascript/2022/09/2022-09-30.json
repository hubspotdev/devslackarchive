    "text": "Any custom element gurus in the house? Why does `attributeChangedCallback` fire on load?\nExample: `&lt;my-el foo=\"bar\"&gt;&lt;/my-el&gt;` consoles out `\"foo was null\"` and `\"foo is now bar\"`\n```class MyEl extends HTMLElement {\n  static get observedAttributes() {\n    return [\"foo\"];\n  }\n\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.innerHTML = this.foo;\n  }\n\n  attributeChangedCallback(attrName, oldVal, newVal) {\n    if (attrName == \"foo\") {\n      console.log(`${attrName} was ${oldVal}`);\n      console.log(`${attrName} is now ${newVal}`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  get foo() {\n    return this.getAttribute(\"foo\");\n  }\n}\ncustomElements.define(\"my-el\", MyEl);```\nWhy does it load with a value of null and fire a change?",

    "text": "Hello all.  I have a dropdown banner on my site that covers the navigation.  The .leadinModule does not appear on the screen, or in the HTML structure until after about 5 seconds.  When it does appear it is the last element before the closing body tag.  I would like element to be at the top of the HTML structure after the opening body tag so that the element can push down the page content until it is closed.  Does anyone have a solution for how this can be done?  I would think that you can use JS or jQuery to insert after body when element loads of the page, but my attempts have failed."
