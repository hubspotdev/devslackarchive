This is something we'd invest in on the path to GA this year.\n\n<@U05CSV0TUEA> I'll need some time to investigate this, might end up asking you for more examples or more information. In the meantime, I'm curious what is it you are building / why is it that you are retrieving tickets and conversations out of HubSpot and wanting to know how they pair?"

I've noticed there is a little delay to see ticket_to_conversation (v1) association appearing respect the v2 one, but it's not a problem because I do retry.\n\nIn this case v1 never appears and it's a problem for my app. This is happening with email channel, email is connected to HubSpot inbox. Usually it works but lots of time it doesn't"
