Has anyone encountered a similiar issue and come up with any solution or workaround? I'm thinking we'll need to use an external file storage like google drive if not? Any insights anyone might have would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!  <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/api/files>"
