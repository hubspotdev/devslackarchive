Ex: `{% if topic.slug == 'focus-area-business' %} orange {% elif topic.slug == 'focus-area-growth' %} red {% endif %}` But nothing is working - I was wondering what I'm missing.\n\nThanks, I really appreciate it!",

    "text": "Hey <@U030RJ9MFNJ>! On a blog listing page, the `topic` variable checks if you’re on a specific topic listing (for example, a list of all the posts with the topic “Marketing”).\n\nBased on what you’ve described, you probably need to target the `content` object, assuming you’re in the `{% for content in contents %}` loop. That would be `content.topics`.\n\nAdditionally, `content.topics` is an array, because blog posts can have more than one topic.\n\nSo, TLDR, you probably need:\n```{% for topic in content.topics %} {% if topic.slug == 'focus-area-business' %} orange {% elif topic.slug == 'focus-area-growth' %} red {% endif %} {% endfor %}```"
