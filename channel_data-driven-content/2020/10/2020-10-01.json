    "text": "Hi all, got a question. I have a vacancy database (external) and I want to be able to show these vacancies in marketing emails based on the interest of our contacts. So if a contact is interested in a certain branch, I want to show those vacancies. My first thought was to setup a sync between this database (through XML) and use the API to import these vacancies in HubDB. But I just read the docs and they say it is not possible to filter the HubDB based on contact properties. So if a contact has shown interest for a certain branch I can not filter the vacancies based on that branch when I use HubDB.\nDoes anyone know a solution where I can filter HubDB based on contact properties or use a different method to get those vacancies in the marketing emails?\nThanks!",
