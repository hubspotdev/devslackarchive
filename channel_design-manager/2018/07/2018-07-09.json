    "text": "Hi Talia, I already fixed that template, but you can try creating a custom module on the old DM containing an Image field with a sample image and add it to a template, then switch to the new DM and upgrade that module. Now edit its default content in the template and see the preview/or create a page. I think this happens only when the custom module includes an Image field. I’ve made a video to demonstrate this problem (I’ll direct message the link shortly)"
