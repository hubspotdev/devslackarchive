    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI’m working on building a module in HubSpot CMS for our software, and I could use some advice. The module is essentially a table that displays features available for different subscription tiers. Each row should have a varying number of checkmarks (e.g., one, two, or three) under the corresponding tier.\nI’m currently running into an issue with my implementation. Specifically, when I try to apply checkmarks to a specific tier, they end up appearing in all the rows. Here's the code I’m working with:\n```&lt;div class=\"new_features__additional-section\"&gt;\n  {% for item in module.new_feature_text %}\n    &lt;div class=\"new_features__info-box\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"new_features__info-text\"&gt;{% inline_text field=\"new_feature_text\" value=\"{{ item }}\" %}&lt;/div&gt;\n      {% for item in module.checkmark_amount %}\n        &lt;div class=\"new_features__checkmark-container\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"new_features__checkmark-area\"&gt;\n            &lt;svg class=\"new_features__icon\"&gt;\n              &lt;use href=\"#checkmark\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n            &lt;/svg&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      {% endfor %}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  {% endfor %}\n&lt;/div&gt;```\nDoes anyone have suggestions on how to improve this? I need to ensure that checkmarks are applied correctly to each row based on its specific tier, rather than applying the checkmarks globally.",

    "text": "Hi team,\nWe have recently launched the multilingual version of the website <https://emea.contecinc.com>\n\nYou'll see that this shows a language selector on top. This selector is populated via the programming code of the attached screenshot. It contains the published language variants of the page the user is currently on.\n\nEvery now and then, it seems that HubSpot automatically adds \"?portalID=9161840\" as a querystring to this list of languages. Strange enough, this is not consistent: sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. We are in any case not adding it ourselves. Could you please help us to understand why this is happening? Thank you :pray:",
