    "text": "Are blog comment forms borked in multi-language sites? The form is totally not respecting the language of the post.\n\nIt generates new English language forms for posts, and apparently if I correct a form for a blog/post the changes propagate, but as it is right now it's impossible to know which blog/post the form pertains to, so I might accidentally localize an English blog's form to Finnish and vice versa.\n\nThe cat's out of the bag in the sense that there's already hundreds of posts on the site and we're retroactively introducing comments.\n\nMaybe I'm doing something wrong? I'm using the standard HubSpot comment form module that just does `{% blog_comments \"blog_comments\" limit=10000 %}` (I guess I could just call that instead of the blog comments module but hey).",
