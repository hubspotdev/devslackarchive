Then I placed them both on the same page so my team can compare them. So the top one's css seems to be over riding the bottom ones unless I use !important which then it overrides the top one. I'm confused I thought these were self contained unless we added outside sheets. Am I wrong? I'm working in a sandbox with themes.",
