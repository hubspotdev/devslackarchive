I realize this is a major UI challenge to solve but I think it can be solved.\n\nSo what I see happening every now and again is users resize columns in their tables.  The columns get automatically set at px values.\n\nMakes sense but not for the majority of situations. Would be better if it would do percents. Seems like the logic already has to be in there to be able to calculate the px values anyways, might as well use percents.\n\nSo that’s problem Uno.\n\nProblem Dos. the tables it generates are not very friendly to screen readers. I realize this is a tougher problem to solve but I still think it’s possible to provide a UI for it."
