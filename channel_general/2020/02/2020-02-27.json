Using local development I can push those files up to HubSpot but there seems to be no other way of getting the files into HubSpot. If I try to FTP them I get an error saying only templates and modules can be uploaded and there is no way of uploading files through the design manager. What is best practice for managing assets? I realise I can store th images in 'files' but what then happens when I want to push this theme from my developer portal to my clients account?"
