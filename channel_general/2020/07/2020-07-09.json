Keep it ultra simple, you shouldn’t be asking them to build a full website. You need to respect their time.\n\nBut intentionally add in to your mockup things that can help you gauge:\nAttention to detail\nWhether they are up-to-date on technology or atleast a quick learner\n\nGive them a reasonable time frame, realize they may be working a job right now and have family commitments.\n\nYou can learn a lot from a small exercise like this if well thought out and condensed."

Part of launch will actually be attaching a new domain (they got acquired) though... So the staging area for that new domain won't exist until then... So my thought is push everything from staging to the current domain. And then set the primary domain to the new one once it's attached. _*My question is will that auto rollover over all pages to the new primary domain. Or will we have to go page by page and flip the domain (which will be rough because it's like 150 pages...)*_",
