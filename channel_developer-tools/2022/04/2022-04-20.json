    "text": "Hello Developers, any comments on this:\nIn case of submitting one contact form and data storiation in HubSpot DB (Contact/Company list),\nWith an email when I’m submitting one set of details it’s creating new contact and with the help of Work Flow Diagram It’s converting to one deal, that’s perfect. But, when with the same email id I’m submitting same set of details with different values then the same contact details are getting updated, In that case what we want is to create 1 contact which will contain 2 different sets of values.\n\nExample:\nWith email - <mailto:reya@xyz.com|reya@xyz.com> I’m submitting one form with set of details,\nLOCATION : Canada\nPHONE: 8983456345\nROLE: Construction Manager\n\nIt’s creating one contact and with the help of Work Flow Diagram It’s converting to one deal.\n\n*BUT* when with the same email id - <mailto:reya@xyz.com|reya@xyz.com> I’m submitting the same form with same set of details but with different values,\nLOCATION : US\nPHONE: 9999456367\nROLE: Project Manager\n\nIt’s Updating the previous contact and deal details, and as a result the previous set of data getting deleted (LOCATION : Canada  PHONE: 8983456345    ROLE: Construction Manager) and we can only view the new set of details  (LOCATION : US   PHONE: 9999456367   ROLE: Project Manager).\n\n• We need to have multiple numbers of details under a single Contact/Deal Id with same set of details with different values.\n• Can we find some way like, system will check the primary key (email) first if it found duplicate, will check the secondary key (job role) if that not found duplicate then it will create a New contact/deal id?\nIs there any way to find a solution on that?"

    "text": "Hi - just curious if anyone knows how to get all the even rows in a repeater? what I want to do is give all the even rows a specific class. I tried using loop.index but from what I've found, it only targets specific rows. Am I missing something? below is a sample of what I have and it works, but only for the second row. I tried loop.index == 'even' but that didn't work\n```    {% for item in module.timeline_item %}\n      &lt;div class=\"timeline-item\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"timeline-content {% if loop.index == '2' %}js--fadeInRight{% else %}js--fadeInLeft{% endif %}\"&gt;\n          &lt;h5&gt;{% inline_text field=\"timeline_title\" value=\"{{ item.timeline_title }}\" %}&lt;/h5&gt;\n          {% inline_rich_text field=\"timeline_content\" value=\"{{ item.timeline_content }}\" %}\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    {% endfor %}```",
