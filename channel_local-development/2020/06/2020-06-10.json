But I think they are working on allowing you to do it from Design Tools.\n\nI personally would rather work in my own editor where I have snippets and whatnot set up and emmet and autocompete. It helps make the coding aspect of things go a bit smoother. But there are some aspects of the local environment that take a bit of time to become comfortable with. Ie - making modules and adding fields to them and managine the meta data etc. But if you are going to be building a lot in hs I would def take the time to work with the CLI and Local  setup. It also makes it easy to utilize some kind of version control too. Which is another huge benefit."
