    "text": "Hi there!  I am trying to solve a problem that I _though_ could be done with a workflow, but there’s a race condition. I’m wondering if there’s another mechanism besides workflows that would be better or if there’s a solution within workflows.  The feature I need to build is to create a task for a user when a Company property changes, let’s call it `message` for example. The value of `message` is added to the task.  The `message` is going to be sent by another system and these can be concurrent or at least fast. Is there a way to lock out changes on the Company or `message` property while the workflow is running? Or is there an API for triggering a workflow?",

Then send a webhook somewhere to trigger your workflows in HubSpot, update some contact object to trigger an update, etc"
