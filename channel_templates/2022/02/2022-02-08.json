    "text": "Goooood day all,\n\nI'm having an interesting hiccup with Custom Quote Templates (please let me know if that needs to move to a different channel):\n\nWe've developed some Custom Quote Templates for a client that work within our own portal and they were working in their portal. However, they turned on the Quote Approval feature and since then they haven't been able to approve Quotes made with their Custom Quote Templates.\n\nI thought this might be a permissions consideration (since Custom Quote Templates are a beta that also require Super Admin to interact with them via the Settings menu) but I wanted to see if anyone else had run into this as well and see what your experience had been.\n\nThanks!"
