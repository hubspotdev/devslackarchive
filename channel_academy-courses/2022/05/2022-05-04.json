    "text": "Hi everyone. Sorry if this has been asked and answered. Is there a course, or track that covers basic admin functionality? Things like user creation, different rbac roles, user password resets, dual factor auth, and so on? I have saved a lot of videos from the course catalogue and pages from the docs, but I was hoping there were some recommendations or a learning path for general admin education. Thanks!",
