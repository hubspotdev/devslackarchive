We are wrapping up our prototypes and getting ready for development. I have a few questions:\n1) Where do you start to build your base styles (i.e. create your own style sheet with brand colors, Typekit fonts, etc or use the settings in HubSpot?)\n2) What is the grid HubSpot uses based on? Is it Bootstrap or something else?\n3) Is there a \"guide\" to the css files HubSpot includes? I'm looking for something similar to what bootstrap provides for making images responsive, setting column sizes, hiding on mobile devices, etc.",
