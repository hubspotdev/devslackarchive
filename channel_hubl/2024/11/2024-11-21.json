I am trying to utilize page level variables set as: `{% boolean \"showActivateButton\" value=\"true\" label=\"Show Activate button in navigation\" export_to_template_context=True %}`  in my base.html template and reaching it in a page header through both `content.widgets` or `widget_data`  like: `{% set show_activate_button = content.widgets.showActivateButton.body.value == true %}`  . When I create a new page I see on a page level that value is checked (true), but in the page header I see only empty object for content.widgets. It appears if I manually retrigger the value and update the page. Am I missing something here? Why for me the `content.widgets` is empty initially?",
