    "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nOn the HubSpot forum, my partner and I noticed people asking for push notifications for HubSpot websites. So, we came up with the solution of the problem. It allows sending push notifications for subscribers in the browser even if visitor left a site.\n\nCurrently, it is in the early stages. We are figuring out whether there are people interested in a such solution.\nSo welcome to WebPush beta version. Explore. Install. Try it out. Let us know what you think.\n\nI’m here to answer any questions you may have. Cheers!\n\n<https://web-push-hs.kohorta.co/>",

    "text": "<@UDEASNWEB> yes, it is applicable for blog post pages as a typical HubSpot module.\nWebsite owner creates notifications manually and sends to subscribers. The functionality is pretty simple right now. There are a lot to built upon. We overcame thee main tech challenge to bring web push notifications to HubSpot and would like to test out the idea in the wild.\n\nIs this something you’d be interested to have for HubSpot website?"
