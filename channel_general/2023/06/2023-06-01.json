I’m new to HubSpot CMS and figuring out how all of it works, I’m currently taking the HubSpot developer’s certification program and been dealing with so many bugs mainly related to npm with my linux terminal on my chromebook and powershell terminal on windows. It’s been a rough road but slowly getting the hang of it. "

I’m not entirely clear on this… When a CMS editor creates a page in the CMS (in the case of breadcrumb) I need to automatically get the page title and URL of the parent pages.\n\nNot sure how HubDB fits in? Are you saying that CMS editors need to enter the page titles in HubDB manually? Do they also need to add the URL of the parent page manually to HubDB?"
