I need to have an automated email send a message that contains the month, current date, and year. In CM I can do that using &lt;currentmonthname&gt;, &lt;currentday&gt;, &lt;currentyear&gt;. I've looked in HubSpot forums but am not finding a way to do this. Anyone know the solution? It should be there somewhere, I'v never used an ESP that didn't provide that basic option.",
