I have created an app in HubSpot, granted it access and done an authentication. But the part of my code keeps returning the `SyntaxError: Unexpected token &lt; in  JSON position 0` I checked for resources and some said the code wasn't returning JSON hence the error, but I am quite knew to Node.Js and don't quite know how to track the source of the error.\n```function getStages() {\n  // Prepare authentication to HubSpot\n  var service = getService();\n  var headers = {headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + service.getAccessToken()}};\n  \n  // API request\n  var pipeline_id = \"0\"; \n  var url = API_URL + \"/crm-pipelines/v1/pipelines/deals\";\n  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, headers);\n  var result = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());\n  var stages = Array();\n  \n  // Looping through the different pipelines you might have in HubSpot\n  result.results.forEach(function(item) {\n    if (item.pipelineId == pipeline_id) {\n      var result_stages = item.stages;\n      // Let's sort the stages by displayOrder\n      result_stages.sort(function(a,b) {\n        return a.displayOrder-b.displayOrder;\n      });\n  \n      result_stages.forEach(function(stage) {\n        stages.push([stage.stageId,stage.label]);  \n      });\n    }\n  });\n  \n  return stages;\n}```\n"
