    "text": "Howdy y'all.\n\nAm I misunderstanding \"mobile push\" and the Slack alert settings? We'd like to be able to notify a deal owner when they create a deal that is missing some required fields (e.g. contact &amp; company)... Setting up the conditions is easy but mobile app push doesn't seem to work and neither does it ever trigger a Slack message.\n\nAny suggestions?",
