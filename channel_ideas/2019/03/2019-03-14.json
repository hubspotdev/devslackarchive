    "text": "Idea: `&lt;HEAD&gt;` and `&lt;/BODY&gt;` modules (hear me out).\n\nOften we end up with multiple drag-and-drop templates which share the same CSS and JS files. Sometimes some other last-minute JS is thrown in. We use the \"Additional HEAD markup\" etc. fields in these templates. For various reasons, the top-level defaults in Site Settings won't work for this.\n\nProblem is, that leaves us with multiple independent templates to change if we want to bump our asset version, bust caches etc.\n\nCurrently, the HTML `HEAD` and bottom of the `BODY` (typical places for this stuff) don't get their own modules, but modules are a typical way to share code between templates. It seems like a sensible building block for our arsenal.",
