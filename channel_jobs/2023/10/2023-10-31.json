    "text": "Hello! Our company is in need of a HubSpot developer. We need a custom module that displays custom crm content (the attachments specifically)  based on the logged-in users' properties and or list membership. For example, there are about 1500 technical documents and some of those documents (normally a dozen or so) should be accessible by the logged-in user. We also need to be able to display the whole list without the confidential pieces of info to anyone without being logged in. So some of the info will be displayed to all users, and certain info will be hidden unless the user is logged in with the proper credentials. I have the basic structure set up but need the custom module to be developed.",
