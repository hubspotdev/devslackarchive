Also, i know in the new DMv2 the \"HubL\" module was removed (though is still shown if its a template that already had it in there when you upgraded).~ just noticed you asked about the email one, sorry bout that, I dont think theres anything letting us build into the new drag and drop email templates yet"

We have a few ideas for how the integration between design manager and drag-and-drop templates is going to work, and the plan is to get to a stage where you can create custom drag-and-drop templates, but the main thing we're finalising is how the will relate to each other. Right now emails and templates have a direct 1-1 relationship, change the template, change *every* email that's using it. The plan for drag-and-drop is that the templates will be more of a \"jumping off\" point for the email."
