See example :point_down:\n```  {% global_partial path='./partials/header.html' %} {% module\n      \"page_template_rich_text\" path=\"@HubSpot/rich_text\" label=\"Rich Text\" %}```\nWhat I would like is;\n```{{ require_css(get_asset_url('../css/styles.css')}}\n{{  standard_header_includes }}```\nThanks in advance"

But I found that <https://unibeautify.com/docs/beautifier-js-beautify|UniBeautify> supports various templating languages so I gave it go and initial results seem good. Here is the vscode config. Hope this help those OCD about code formatting like myself.\n1. enable Name: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Glavin001.unibeautify-vscode|Unibeautify - Universal Formatter>\n2. configure vscode `setting.json`\n```...\n  \"[html-hubl]\": {\n    \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"Glavin001.unibeautify-vscode\",\n  },\n...```",

I think it was my `.unibeautifyrc.json`\n```{\n  \"HTML\": {\n    \"beautifiers\": [\n      \"JS-Beautify\"\n    ],\n    \"indent_size\": 2,\n    \"indent_char\": \" \"\n  }\n}```\nLet me know if that sorts it.
