    "text": "Hi All, trying to resurface <@U041K5AHMNH>'s [message](<https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/CD5RBLPBL/p1678757343144749>) from a few months back regarding redirecting users to a specific page after a password reset. It doesn't appear that there's a way to redirect to a specific page (for example, a confirmation page). Additionally, I can't seem to find documentation on the `password_reset` tag to see if there's a possible inline message that can be added.\ncc <@U7SL518D6> do you happen to have any insight?",
