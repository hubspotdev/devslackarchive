    "text": "In a drag and drop area, no you can not git rid of the module (and section/row/column) wrappers. They are required for the page editor to allow “click to edit” a module, drop and drop, etc.\n\nThe only way a developer has control over the module wrapper is if the `no_wrapper=True` HubL param is passed to a `js_partial`, `module`, etc tags: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/using-modules-in-templates#parameters-available-for-all-modules>\n\nps: I (and others) do realize the excessive wrappers, verbose grid, and DOM depth is a problem and should be better. But we don’t have a solution for that yet."
