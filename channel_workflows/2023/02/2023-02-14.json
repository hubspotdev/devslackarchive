    "text": "Hey everyone, my I have several email subscriptions on my page. I have one page for unsubscribing. On this Page you can select individual subscribtions or all subscriptiontions to cancel. When a  user cancels one, several or all subscribtions I want to send out one email where it is listed what the user unsubscribed. Is that possible with workflows? Or will I need to send out one email for each subscribtion the user canceled. If it is not possible with workflows, how could a custom solution look like. Could I use the HubSpot API? Thank you for your help"
