    "text": "<@U38EZFVFE> thanks, but loop.index doesn't work in this case. Why? Because inside the loop we are taking only some posts with a specific tag. So the loop.index of the selected posts might be (for example), 2,12,34,56,99. There's a list of all blog posts and we need to find the first 5 with a specific tag, so loop.index doesn't work in this case. Sorry for the late reply, I was out of office."
