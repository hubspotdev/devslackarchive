This is meant to be generic enough to fit whatever ID scheme you use to keep track of these events in your system. The `PUT` requests are idempotent on this `id`, so another `PUT` with the same `id` will *not* create a new event, but will update the existing event. This `id` must be unique across all accounts using the integration."
