Do you need the `aos-init` class added to the elements you're animating? on the working example, i'm seeing the class of `aos-init` on your elements. for example `&lt;div class=\"benefit bg-berry-100 d-flex justify-content-center aos-init\" data-aos=\"fade-in\" data-aos-delay=\"100\"&gt;`\n\non the example you shared that does *not* work, i'm not seeing that class name."

    "text": "Does `HubFS` have a way to invalidate the cache for certain files?  We have some old HTML files in HubFS that are referenced, and I need to get rid of them.  I replaced it with a bare-bones HTML that just redirects out with a meta tag, but it appears the old version is cached in the HubFS CDN somehow.  If I change querystring arguments, it serves the new one, but the original page is still being served sometimes (even with a clean browser cache).  Can I invalidate the CDN cache, or do I just need to have more patience and let time expire it?"
