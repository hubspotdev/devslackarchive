    "text": "Hi All,  I previously had a thread going int he JS channel - but thought it might apply here. I am trying to access the elements of a HubSpot form as part of the submit function - however it looks like the form elements aren't 'visible'...i.e. when I use .length to find out if a particular set of radio buttons exists, the answer is no. I have also tested by displaying names/values of all elements and the HS elements never show up in the list. Is the HS form hiding its elements??",
