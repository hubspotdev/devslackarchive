For example the text field, rich text field, link field and menu field would be incredibly useful.",

    "text": "Hi <@U6W3H6YN8>! :slightly_smiling_face: So, we use coded templates and include global stuff like header, footer etc. as HTML partials. Some of the use cases I have in mind are:\n\n• Rich text field to be used for text in the site footer. For example, company description, copyright information etc.\n• Form field so the marketer can select a form for their newsletter signup in the site footer\n• Menu selector so the marketer can choose which menus (from Settings: Website &gt; Navigation) to show in the header/footer\n• Text/link fields for buttons/special links in the header/footer where using the standard navigation feature would be clunky\n• Text fields to control wording/content on the blog listing pages (since these can't be edited by the marketer outside the template itself). For example, should the button below blog posts say \"Read more\" or \"Read now\" or whatever.\n• Text fields for global stuff on the blog post template. Like, text, CTA's, forms and whatnot to include in the sidebar\n• Text field for a tagline below the logo in the header\n...and many more :slightly_smiling_face: I realize we could probably solve some of these things with global modules, but then the marketer has to go into the design manager, find the right module and edit it in there. In my head it would make much more sense if all of these theme-specific options were gathered inside of Themes, so the marketer can control all of that from in there."

Rather, than can edit all of the modules/fields in global groups/partials or modules directly from within a friendly editor, just like the content editor. Would love to hear if this experience solve the pain you are describing."
