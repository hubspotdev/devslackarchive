We’re trying to get rid of the button in cases where it shouldn’t be needed (As we “live update” the modules in ~75% of the cases, but we missed some technical cases where  our “do we need to refresh the logic” didn’t account for). Also it can be scary to not a see a confirmation that your change is actually being reflected in the page. We’ll try to think about a better way to roll this out."
