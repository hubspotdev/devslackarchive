    "text": "Not a big expert on accessibility, but W3's WAI guide specifies that:\n\n&gt;The `&lt;fieldset&gt;` element provides a container for related form controls.\n\nSource: <https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/grouping/>\n\nIn the use cases that I've seen the HubSpot forms `&lt;fieldset&gt;` is only used as a way to layout the form fields into columns, regardless of whether the fields are actually related to each other or not. So even if there's an accessibility benefit to `&lt;fieldset&gt;`, I don't think it's actually used properly in the HS forms markup? :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nAnyways, from the link above it seems that you can use `&lt;div role=\"group\"&gt;` to accomplish the same thing as `&lt;fieldset&gt;` does."
