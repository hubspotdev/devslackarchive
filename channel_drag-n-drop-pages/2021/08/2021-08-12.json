The “default” breakpoint is simply styles with no media query (and is the normal mode when in the editor). You could add an object like `{ \"name\": \"default\" }` to this `responsive_breakpoints` array as well, and change the order in which we spit out the styles onto the page. The normal behavior is default (no media query) --&gt; any breakpoints defined in this config, but if you define the default breakpoint in your config, we’ll respect the positioning when it comes to generating css."
