No timeline yet but we’re thinking about how to make it easier to get test access to your action. Right now we’ll show unpublished actions in the developer account, but I understand that not everyone uses the same account as their developer account as they do for testing, so that doesn’t work for everyone.\n\nRe: seeing the errors in the UI, I’ll check with the team if there’s a way that we could make that easier without having to use the browser tools, thanks for flagging that."
