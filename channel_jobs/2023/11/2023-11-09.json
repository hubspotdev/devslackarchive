We're looking for help not just with HubSpot but also with Google's website tools (GTM, GA4, GSC).\n\nWould _love_ if the person was also an SEO expert familiar with Semrush. (That might be a bit much, but we're backfilling a unicorn and we're also open to hiring a separate SEO freelancer.)\n\nWe're looking for freelancers, not agencies, and they must be in the USMCA (US, Mexico, or Canada). Folks who do not meet those requirements will not get a response.\n\nYou can see the full job details and apply here:\n<https://www.ashandelle.com/job/marketing-automation-specialist>",
