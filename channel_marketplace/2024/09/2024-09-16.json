    "text": "Thanks, <@U03AKL6Q1B2>! The super admin successfully installed the app in their account. However, I am uncertain whether the super admin is also required to install the app in the user’s account. Is that necessary? The user received an installation URL, during which the permissions message appears, despite the fact that the super admin has already granted all the necessary permissions for the app. I greatly appreciate your assistance!"
