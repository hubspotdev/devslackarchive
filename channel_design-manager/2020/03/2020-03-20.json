At this time It does work with default modules for text and rich text. For custom modules.\n\nAt this time inside of a custom module fields outputted with that inline text tag cannot be edited that way. That said that doesn’t mean that functionality won’t be added down the road."

Clicking `Manage` just lets you edit the default footer.\n\nI’m aware the alternative is to edit emails outside of workflows, but our guys use this a lot and I don’t want to ask them to change their workflow."
