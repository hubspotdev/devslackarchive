    "text": ":bulb: There really needs to be a way to reset stats on pages and forms in HubSpot. It makes near impossible to do testing on pages and forms as you start getting test stats in it like submissions and views and conversions. I know you can always add ip's to the exclusion in settings but when you have remote employees without dedicated IP's it makes it hard to be able to provide metrics correctly without simply cloning the form every time you are ready to roll. /rant"
