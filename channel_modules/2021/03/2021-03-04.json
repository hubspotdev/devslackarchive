    "text": "Hi! For some reason some of the modules my team made, when they are editing it disappears from the preview window. The module toolbar and options still works and can still hit \"Apply Changes\" for the changes to work. But I cannot understand why simply editing it in real time would make the module disappear in the preview window right next to it. To clarify it still exists when change is done just a problem with the preview page making the module disappear."
