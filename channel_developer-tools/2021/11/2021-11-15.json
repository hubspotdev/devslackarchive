If I try to delete that extra clone and all the modules inside its folder I get a warning about live dependencies with many dependencies. Am I safe to delete this cloned version that I don’t use or should I do this another way? I did not use that extra clone to build any pages. It was just an experiment. Thanks in advance!",
