I would have wanted the header to span across the whole page 100% but i seem to be stuck in the grid no matter what i do: <https://mailers.propdata.net/?hs_preview=EfTBghBI-29541136705>\n\nIs there a way to break out of this grid? Thereâ€™s a 800 width set that contains all my modules and i dont think i can change that value?"
