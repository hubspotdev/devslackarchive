To unblock it, I need to be able to edit the script tag generated for that file. e.g.\n\nHere's the tag that loads on the page right now:\n<script src=\"<http://examplescript.com/javascript.js|examplescript.com/javascript.js>\"></script>\n\nHere's what I need it to be:\n<script *data-ot-ignore* src=\"<http://examplescript.com/javascript.js|examplescript.com/javascript.js>\"></script>\n\nAnyone know how to do this?"
