    "text": "My question was around managing adding data into a HubSpot database rather than the output to  a site page. I have an order column where each row has a number. Unfortunately when we add a new row that needs to be numbered for example sixth in the order all the other entries need to be updated by 1 so that the new row can slot in. My question is can I reorder the view within the HubSpot editable database so that the rows are displayed using the order column rather than showing the most recently added row at the bottom of the table?"
