    "text": "<@UFBDBKQ1H> Thanks! This is close, but not quite there yet. The rolling 90 days might not be the very first 5 emails that someone received. They may have received emails prior to the previous 90 days, so we're looking for any 5+ emails. For more context, we're planning our re-engagement campaign that would go to subscribers that have not opened a marketing email in the past 90 days. However, some of our segments receive more emails than others, based on what is on sale for their segment and when. So, within that rolling 90 day period, some segments will have less opportunity to engage with us than other segments, so we wanted to put in a filter if possible that they received minimum 5 emails in that rolling 90 day period."
