    "text": "<@U07VDRL4S87>, I was just asking about the `fields.json` setup because I find it a bit complicated. The thing is, I’ve created all the other files; I’m just trying to figure out what exactly needs to be done in the `fields.json` file. I just need to know where to start.\nAlso, how can I make the URL look clean and perfect?"
