    "text": "Hi <@U0133B70U3Z>,\nQ1.  No, this is not possible when using the ecomm bridge API. But you can use the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/get_contact_by_email|Contacts> API to check if a contact exists in a portal. Or what I see other devs using is the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/webhooks/webhooks-overview|Webhooks> API to subscribe to Contact deletions. This will alert your integration/app when a contact has been deleted in a HS account.\nQ2. The Delete action in the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/ecommerce/v2/send-sync-messages|Sync Messages> endpoint  will not remove the contact, deal, product from HubSpot, it will prevent it from syncing in the future. If you wish to update an object you will need to use the 'Upsert' action.\nQ3. Let me test this and add an update in here for you."
