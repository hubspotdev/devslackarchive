What if i want to add custom filters apart from tag and date. Like i want my blog to be categorised in different categories which are not tags. And then filter them based on category. Can i do that?"

My clients want to copy/paste and quickly modify layouts without code so I need to stay within the drag/drop realm.  Using a prefix on the classes has been key-thanks!"
