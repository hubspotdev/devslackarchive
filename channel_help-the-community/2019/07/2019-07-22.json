    "text": "Hi All\n\nNot sure if this is helpful for others, we were having issues where a number of our client root domains were not forwarding onto the www subdomain. All these were on Cloudflare and we needed to add a A record for this to work properly, but Cloudflare wouldn't accept the A record IP due to it being a Cloudflare IP (HS use CF), so this was the work around -\n\nOn Cloudflare -\n1. Set CNAME  -\nname - www\nvalue - [HS system url]\n\n2. Set A record -\nname - [ROOT URL (<http://example.com|example.com>)]\nvalue - 192.0.2.1\n\n3 - Set 2 x 301 Redirects -\nfirst - <https://example.com/*> forward to <https://www.example.com/$1>\nsecond - <http://example.com/*> forward to <https://www.example.com/$1>\n\nWorked a treat for us."
