    "text": "Hi, I’m creating a new theme and wondering what are the responsive options I can utilise with theme development? For example, If I have two columns, both of span6, on mobile, how can I:\n\n1. Hide certain columns\n2. Change the ordering of how the columns are presented. For example, if I have a row with is text and image. On smaller screens, the image column will sit underneath the text. What if I want to order it so image is first?\nIs the above only achievable via css? If so, I think that will be quite messy because, looking at the docs, a class can only be applied to a dnd_area. I don’t want to be targeting HubSpot generated classes to change flex ordering on mobile. What are my options?"
