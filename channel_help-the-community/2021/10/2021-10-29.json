    "text": "I’d recommend looking at the HubSpot Boilerplate on GitHub - it has a few examples of modules using Style fields + standard fields.\n\nTop level overview:\n• Two types of fields - Style and Content. Style fields will, naturally fill the style tab. On the docs it’ll give you a good overview of what you can use\n• Personally, I would avoid doing too much layout work inside a module, unless required. Avoid things like margin and properties which impact surrounding modules/elements. Make the module 100% so it can be use as columns, or full width.\n• dnd_* tags, are for layout yes - your module will be placed as a dnd column with a width (based on the size the user specifies/where they drag it)\n• dnd is based on a stripped down bootstrap grid, so your module for example could be placed in a col-md-2"
