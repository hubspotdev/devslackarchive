We need multiple env. for development purposes:\n• Acceptation, for client delivery and beta testing (current enterprise sandbox of plan)\n• Staging, for internal QA\n• Local, for every developer to work on locally\nAcceptation is linked with Github actions (HS best practices), this makes is not suiteable as a live development env. because every code change needs a github push in order to become available on the HS. Imagine sending an email for every text line you type on slack .\n\n*Is it not possible to open up those permission for at least the local env. of the B/E dev working on this module?*"
