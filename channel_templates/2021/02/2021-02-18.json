Thanks!\n\nI’m in the process of creating a theme. As a reference I use default HubSpot code files trying to understand the best way of development.\nI stumbled upon this piece of code responsible for an icon but, unfortunately, can’t find anything about it in HubSpot documentation. If anyone could guide me where to read in more detail about icon code snippet it’d be great!\n```{% icon \n   name=\"chevron-down\" \n   style=\"SOLID\",\n   width=\"16\",\n   purpose=\"semantic\",\n   title=\"Open the submenu\",\n   no_wrapper=True\n %}```",
