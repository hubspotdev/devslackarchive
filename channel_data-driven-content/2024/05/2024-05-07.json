The only thing my google turned up was this similar unanswered question on the community. <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Set-HubDB-Table-value-in-a-HubDB-Row-field/td-p/759728>\n\nAnyone know if this is possible?\nThanks!"

    "text": "Hi, thanks for your answer. Yes and it is mentioned that you should assign one child table per row. That's why I would like to know if there is a useful trick to summarize the information of the child table in one. I tested this and then used an if condition to control the output so that only matching countries/cities are shown. However, this is probably less efficient than creating and assigning individual tables? Thanks :)"

Is there anyone here who has a trick how this would be possible? It is about transferring objects from the DB to the CRM (but not all of the data) so that they do not have to be created and updated twice in the CRM. I would be very grateful for any tips and hints :)"
