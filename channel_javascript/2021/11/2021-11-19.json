    "text": "Hi all,\n \nI'm trying to add the HubSpot tracking code to a website, but unfortunately something seems to be missing, so visits aren't tracked in HubSpot.\n \nBasically, I want to track visits to two specific pages, and - preferably - register which links are clicked. I need to do this using the Tracking Code API to call a custom behavioral event as described here: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/events/tracking-code>\n \nI've added the tracking code (using the code snippit found under settings) to the page and added the new domain under Settings / Tracking &amp; Analytics / Tracking Code / Advanced Tracking.\n \nI then added the js code to the page to call the custom behavioral event, but nothing happens in HubSpot, so it looks like nothing's triggered. I'm obviously missing something, but I'm not sure what :confused:\n\nCan anybody help?\n\n(Screenshot of code in next message)",
