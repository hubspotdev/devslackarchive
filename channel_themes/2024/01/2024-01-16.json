    "text": "Hi All,\n\nISSUE :\nI just found out that when the files in filemanager are Private, they're only accessible if you're logged on to HubSpot (not the HubSpot website itself front end ). So in order for files to be accessible in the website, they need to be marked Public - No index.\n\nThe desired behavior is that all Files stored in the HubSpot filemanager are Private, but as long as you're logged on the website you should be able to see them.",
