    "text": "Hello, does anyone know if it's possible to set the owner of a contact using the Create or Update contact api? I'm not sure if it's a bug, I am creating a contact and company and then associating them, and as part of the payload for each, it checks if there is an owner query parameter and sets the owner if there is. It is working in all regards, but for some reason the owner is not being set on the contact record (it is working for the company).\nI logged the data being sent for the contact, it is:\n\n{\"properties\":[{\"property\":\"firstname\",\"value\":\"Stephen\"},{\"property\":\"lastname\",\"value\":\"Brown\"},{\"property\":\"email\",\"value\":\"<mailto:stephen+test2@impulsecreative.com|stephen+test2@impulsecreative.com>\"},{\"property\":\"company\",\"value\":\"testfdas\"},{\"property\":\"HubSpot_owner_id\",\"value\":\"87349627\"}]}\n\nAll properties other than HubSpot_owner_id are being set without issue. I should note that there are no errors that are being caught.\n\nAny help would be appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:",

    "text": "Hey Stephen, this is possible, a couple of thoughts:\n\n1. The owner ID is a unique value from both the owner’s contact and HubSpot ID; to find it you can either query the API for the values tied to each email or poke around in the inspector on the properties settings page.\n2. If there’s any other automation in the portal that is responsible for assigning the owner ID based on a workflow or other qualifying logic, then that may be overwriting or conflicting with your API script"
