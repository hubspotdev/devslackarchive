I’ve tried updating the property via the API, but it seems like the `hidden` functionality only works for forms. Has anyone encountered this before or found a solution?\n\nThanks in advance!"

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe are encountering an issue regarding the functionality of a custom HTML form created in PHP. Our requirement is to submit the form data and insert it into a specific form in HubSpot.\n\nBased on our research, we are using the following API endpoint to achieve this:\n\n<https://api.hsforms.com/submissions/v3/integration/submit/yourPortalId/yourFormGuid?__hstc=20629287.f70c68149a85f6a7ae5c1854438c6b27.1733977481571.1733977481571.1733981989182.2&amp;__hssc=20629287.1.1733981989182&amp;__hsfp=4200627391|API>\n\nThis API allows us to insert data into a specific form, which meets our initial requirement. However, we are now looking for a functionality that would allow us to update the inserted data by matching the email ID.\n\nIn essence, after a data entry has been inserted, we want to be able to update this data using the matching email ID as the reference point.\n\nWe have been unable to find a solution to this requirement. Could you please assist us in resolving this issue? We kindly request your prompt response to this matter."
