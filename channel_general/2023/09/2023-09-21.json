Has anyone found a workaround for the following scenario: \n\n• HubSpot integration with Salesforce. \n• Multiple audiences (like a marketplace, Etsy - buyer &amp; seller, Uber - driver &amp; homeowner) with records that can cross over between two or more audiences. \n• Records in Salesforce do not need to be unique on email address e.g <mailto:johndoe@gmail.com|johndoe@gmail.com> has two contact records in Salesforce - one as audience A and one as audience B. \n• The property data is different depending on the audience (address, phone, related objects, etc.). \nIt’s a big one to unpack - but does anyone have any ideas / has seen this before and designed a solution? Sounds like a custom contact object / API could help….. :face_with_monocle: "
