    "text": ":new: :boom: *Custom logger API to debug extension failures in-production*\n\nWhen an extension fails to load or function during it's usage in production by end users, it's difficult to find out what led to that failure. Custom `logger` API allows you to send customized log messages to our platform, that can be visible in private app extension logs or can be accessed via log tracing system.
