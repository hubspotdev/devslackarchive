    "text": "Hey all : )\nI am currently using HubSpot's meeting link for demo sign-ups, which is embedded on my website under my domain. Additionally, the tracking code is embedded on the site.\nHowever, I've noticed an issue with the tracking of incoming leads. Despite our efforts, the original source of these leads is being recorded as direct traffic.\nIn reality, these leads should be attributed to paid search (ads properties are not being populated as well...)\nAll UTMs are preserved from the first click on the ad up until the final (demo submission).\nHas anyone ever faced that issue and can assist?",
