I think it’s exactly what Chad stated though unfortunately.\n\n<@U3T21PDBK> you can definitely change it yourself by cloning that module. been a little bit since I last looked at the code for the module but pretty confident no CSS or JS was selecting the input based on it’s type. So should be an easy change."

I ve read the If statements but i dont get it pretty well.\n\n```{% set choice_val = \"{{ module.header_button.header_button_target.value }}\" %}    \n        {% if choice_val == 'self' %}\n          &lt;a href=\"{{ module.header_button.header_button_link_url }}\" target=\"_self\"&gt;{{ module.header_button.header_button_link_text }}&lt;/a&gt;\n        {% elif choice_val == 'blank' %}\n          &lt;a href=\"{{ module.header_button.header_button_link_url }}\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;{{ module.header_button.header_button_link_text }}&lt;/a&gt;\n        {% endif %}```\nThank you",
