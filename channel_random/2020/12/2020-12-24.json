    "text": "Happy holidays everyone.\nWith Covid-19 I'm sure a lot of traditions and plans have had to change, hope you're all staying safe, healthy, and taking care of your mental health.\n\nKnow that people in this community care about you, know that what you do matters.\n\nDevelopment isnt easy, and web development specifically isnt easy. It takes a lot of skill, time, and energy. You have to care about accessibility, ensuring everyone can use what you make using any type of device, with any screen size, supporting many different web browsers, with any internet quality. You have to care about the things you make being findable through SEO. You have to care about reliability, and speed. You have to care about having a good UX. You have to connect lots of tools together to make a finished product.\n\nRemember that right now a large portion of the world right now is relying on technology you and other developers have built to stay connected, stay healthy, stay productive, keep businesses functioning, and help folks retain their jobs, and find new ones. \n\nSo this holiday, remember what you do matters and has made the world a bit more bearable this year. \n\n:snowman:  Happy holidays everyone :snowflake:",
