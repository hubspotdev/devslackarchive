    "text": "Hi there, I'm trying to make a custom *email template* that uses a deal property to filter a crm_objects query like so:\n\n```{% set country = deal.country %}\n{% set query_string = \"limit=3&amp;country__eq=\" ~ country %}\n{% set objects = crm_objects(\"product\", query_string, \"name,country\") %}\n{% for product in objects.results %}\n&lt;p&gt;{{ product.name }} - {{ product.country }}&lt;/p&gt;\n{% endfor %}```\nBut I can't make it work, when testing it via email preview and selecting *Deals* -&gt; *My Deal* -&gt; *My Contact* the products are not shown, it feels like if there were different rendering cycles and when the deal is selected the crm_objects has already run and it's always empty.\n\nThe idea is to then have a deal-based workflow that will suggest products based on the deal country."
