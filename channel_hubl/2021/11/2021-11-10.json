For example....\n\n<http://example.com/page?awesome=yes|example.com/page?awesome=yes>\n\nHow would I use the param in and if statement?  I basically am looking for something like this.\n```\n{% if param == 'yes' %}\nYou're awesome Dude\n{% else %}\nYou're not so awesome man\n{% endif %}```\nAny insight is massively appreciated.",
