Does anyone have knowledge on this, how do we access this data or is there an API for this?\n\n\n\nThank you in advance for any help! :slightly_smiling_face:\n(P.S. I'm not a dev, no code knowledge here, just digging for some information &amp; guidance)",

    "text": "Hi, I’ve got a Nuxt website (ie Vue JS single page application with server-sided rendering) with the HubSpot tracking JS installed and I’m having issues with pop-up forms and CTAs not appearing on in-app page navigation. The forms load correctly when first visiting the page in a new tab or with a page refresh but don’t appear after the Vue router has redirected to the page. The page tracking is working as intended after following the instructions (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/events/tracking-code#tracking-in-single-page-applications>) however the forms and CTAs don’t appear and I’m thinking its because the tracking and form/CTA libraries work independently. Has anyone else experienced similar issues and (hopefully) found a solution to getting HubSpot JS working on SPAs :slightly_smiling_face: ? Thanks!"
