    "text": "Hello Guys,\n\nDoes anyone know if it is possible to create “Custom Workflow Actions” for HubSpot’s private apps? I am currently doing a custom integration for my company and ran into a road block when trying to use the /automation/v4/actions/{appId}?hapikey={apiKey} API endpoint. So far, i was able to use the Bearer Token for the private app to create custom objects and access built-in object types.\n\nThe error I got when I tried using the custom action API is: “This API can’t be called using an OAuth access token. A valid developer API key must be provided in the `hapikey` query parameter, and a valid `appId` must be provided in the API request.”\n\nDoes this mean I will have to create a public app in order to access it? Further, i tried the main API key on the account and that didn’t work either.\n\nKind regards,",
