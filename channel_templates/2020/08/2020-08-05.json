Would someone mind hand holding for a few minutes to get me on the right track?~\n\n~I have a couple of fields that render as bullet items. (I'm not clear on different editing modes here, but I'm looking at a GUI editor representing a grid system, and a list of fields for each module on the right pane. Please ask for clarification as needed.) If the fields are empty, they render empty bullet points~ :man-facepalming: ~All I want to do for now is conditionally render the lists and/or items depending on whether the field is empty. When I go to edit the template, it the template is read only.~\n\n~I would love to work through this myself, but I have other obligations and would VERY much appreciate being pointed in the right direction. Thank you!~\n\nSOLVED, thank you"
