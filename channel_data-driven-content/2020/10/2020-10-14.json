This question was asked about two years ago, and I’m trying to implement something similar and was curious if there was a solution?\n“Hello, I have a request that may or may not be helpful to most people...sorting in the multi select so that the return array shows in the order of the field. For example below if I wanted to show the image first then the richtext content i could reverse the selection. Now it is sorting it by ID of the field value”",

    "text": "Howdy folks! I was wondering if anyone knew how to filter a table based on the multi-select column. I have this where module.audience is a dropdown where they can select a tag that appears in the multi-select:\n```{% set filterarg = \"audience__eq=\" ~ module.audience ~ \"&amp;orderBy=-priority&amp;limit=3\" %}\n{% set table = hubdb_table_rows(2666357, filterarg) %}```\nThe issue is that it will match for rows that have the one tag in there but it will not match if it has that item plus other tags. I tried to use a contain operator like audience__co but that gave me an error saying that the operator wasn’t supported. Any help here would be greatly appreciated!",
