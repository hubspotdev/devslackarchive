    "text": "GraphQL has been a huge win for us. It makes it much simpler to do complicated multi-object calls. For example, listing 10 different properties on 20 associated companies. Much simpler and faster for us to execute on.\n\n1. GQL, Company, Deal, Contact, Quote, User/Owner APIs. Creating/updating/fetching information.\n2. Nothing super complicated from our side. We’re working on extending quite a bit of functionality on Line Items and Quotes.\n3. We haven’t really bumped into anything too challenging, but we’ve also worked with the API for a while in e.g. Code Action Workflows.\n4. Rest for reading/updating single or simple queries. Anything that involves associated or multiple objects, we usually go for GQL."
