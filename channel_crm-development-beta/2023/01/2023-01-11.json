Because your portal is ungated to the serverless packages beta, you will need to complete the following steps to publish your changes:\n\n1. update the serverless function definition in DM\n2. click the “publish changes” button\n3. right-click the folder and click “deploy all functions”\nAnother option is to make the desired changes from the CLI. We realize that this is not intuitive and will evaluate solutions for developers working in the design manager.",
