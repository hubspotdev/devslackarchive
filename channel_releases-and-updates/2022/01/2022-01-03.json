    "text": "Ah, I see what you mean, thanks for explaining. We don't have plans to allow developers to completely hide those tabs. The reason is that if, for instance, you have no editable fields in the Content tab and you made it so that content tab didn't show at all, the person using the module would have questions about why this module had only one tab (style) and other modules had both tabs. By keeping the tab there, we can at least explain what's going on with the content tab and why it's lacking editable fields.\n\nI will say though, that we are making some improvements to the empty states for the content and style tabs for when there are no editable fields."
