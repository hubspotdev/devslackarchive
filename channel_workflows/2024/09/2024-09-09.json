    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI’m building custom workflow actions in HubSpot for my system and have run into an issue. I have an enumeration property in HubSpot, and I want to add that property to an input field so the user can directly select from the property’s values. This approach works perfectly with the “owner” property, but it’s not working with any object property.\nHere’s the working example for the owner property:\n\n```{\n    \"typeDefinition\": {\n        \"name\": \"widgetOwner\",\n        \"type\": \"enumeration\",\n        \"fieldType\": null,\n        \"options\": [],\n        \"optionsUrl\": null,\n        \"referencedObjectType\": \"OWNER\",\n        \"externalOptions\": false,\n        \"externalOptionsReferenceType\": null\n    },\n    \"supportedValueTypes\": [\n        \"STATIC_VALUE\"\n    ],\n    \"isRequired\": false\n}```\nI’d like to achieve the same functionality for my any object property. Does anyone have any advice or know how will it work with object properties?\n\nThanks!",

I think the custom code is a deal breaker, they are looking for a declarative way to achieve this which doesn’t seem to be included in any native workflow.  We are looking at pushing forward with <http://Make.com|Make.com> to bridge that gap for them."
