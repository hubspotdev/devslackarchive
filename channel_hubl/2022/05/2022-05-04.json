    "text": "<@U03EG1Q4TB2> <@U3T21PDBK> well... I had this massive reply all ready to send with 7-8 images and snippets, etc and when I was getting my last image ready, I fixed my issue. I don't know if something changed on HubSpots end in the last week since I was investigating this, but I added the `icon_set` parameter back into my embed code and it is working now even with the icons that didn't before. I thoroughly tested this with and without that parameter multiple times and it wasn't working before, lol... I wonder if there was just some update bug or something with HubSpot not registering the changes. At this point, I guess i'm not having any issues anymore.. Sorry... (below is an image of what I had ready to send :sweat_smile:)",
