Not sure this is the right place to post it, would love to get some feedback from the community though. <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maglabs.HubSpot-hubl-snippets>\n- any devs out there looking to speed up their development, please give it a spin and let me know what you think. Thanks in advance!"
