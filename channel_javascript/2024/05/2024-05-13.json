    "text": "Hey <@U070H34HTFT> \nThe main concept you have to recreate is that the HubSpot tracking code creates a cookie in the browser called `HubSpotutk`. The value of this cookie is sent along to HubSpot on every page view (it works similarly to how Google analytics works). This cookie value has to be associated to a HubSpot contact record by one of a few ways. The 2 most relevant here:\n1. via a form submission (HubSpot forms capture his automatically) or the forms API \n2. The JavaScript tracking code API making an `identify` call and then a `track page view` or `track custom event` call\nAssuming you’re able to write JavaScript and programmatically interact with the WebinarGeek form, you can either submit to the HS Forms API after the WebinarGeek form submission and include the HubSpotutk and email address. Or, fire identify and a custom event \n\n• look for the HubSpotutk/ `hutk` <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form|https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/submit_form>\n• <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/events/tracking-code|https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/events/tracking-code>\n• I wrote this and should help you out <https://gist.github.com/robertainslie/b110b8275beee1b27255c4d6e2ba2e8c|https://gist.github.com/robertainslie/b110b8275beee1b27255c4d6e2ba2e8c>"
