Just hoping a wider audience might be able to lend some insight?\n\nWe're working on a campaign where we need a single link within an email to appear as a different domain when the user hovers on it (or copy/pastes it from the email).\n\ne.g.\n• Link 1: <http://www.example.com/link1|www.example.com/link1>\n• Link2: <http://www.anotherdomain.com/link2|www.anotherdomain.com/link2>\n\nIt's not desirable for us to deactivate the 'track click' options the settings for this particular portal.\n\nAny ideas how we could make this happen?",

Can I integrate Google Analytics into HubSpot so that both cookies are controlled by HubSpot and use the HubSpot GDPR banner? I think the Google Analytics integration requires me to connect my domain to HubSpot, but I understand that this does not work with self-hosted websites. In this case it would not be possible to integrate GA into HubSpot to control cookies from within HubSpot. Am I right?",
