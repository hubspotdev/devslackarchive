    "text": "Anyone have a reliable way to capture changed properties that caused a webhook workflow? I would like to have one workflow that can be triggered by multiple property changes. When the webhook fires, I have a `lastmodifieddate`, but sometimes that can be updated between the property change that triggered the flow and the send, resulting in that time being tied only to a relatively meaningless property like `currentlyinworkflow`.\nI am considering taking some arbitrary lookback from `lastmodifieddate` and scooping up everything within the horizon, but that feels so unfortunateâ€¦ anyone found a good way for themselves? A custom field set by the workflow might be an improvement, but still relies on timing to some degree.",
