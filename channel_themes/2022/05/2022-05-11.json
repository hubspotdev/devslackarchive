One of my theme customers installed my theme, styled their header and footer in the dnd editor, then created a child theme so they could make edits to their blog post template, but the blog post template (which uses the child theme) is rendering the header and footer's default styling - as though the changes they made to the @marketplace copy did not carry over.",
