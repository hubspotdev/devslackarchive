I was wondering if someone could help me out with the following issue:\nI'm trying to feed our media releases into a blog format, but all of the templates that I've looked at seem to require images. I'm kind of hoping I can push these releases into a list view rather than the block model commonly used for blog posts. Can anyone point me in the right direction?"
