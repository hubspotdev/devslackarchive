    "text": "Hi,\n\nQuestion about one HubDB case.\n\nCurrent situation:\nClient has an system integration service (<https://www.flashnode.com/en/apps>), which uses HubDB to create dynamically pages where two system are merged to one page. Like this:\n<https://www.useloom.com/share/8eaf4925fba44c9296ab872cd1b59d50>\n\nProblem:\nRight now systems are added in one database table and with URL attributes they are merged in one common page (there are also other tables which adds custom texts to those pages).\nLike this: <https://www.flashnode.com/en/integrations/shopify?app=magento&amp;app1=shopify&amp;app2=magento>\nCurrent problem is that with this method these merged pages don't have individual page title and cannot be found in search engines.\n\nSolution:\nOne solution would be use own dynamic table for merged systems and add rows for all different system combinations (and connect systems with that foreign ID -method). Problematic is that there are about 30 systems (in two different language, which are separate), so there would be lot of combinations. And when new system is added to database we would need to add more combinations.\nBut I guess this is the only reasonable method, if we want to have page titles in those merged pages?",
