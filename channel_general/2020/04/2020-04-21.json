    "text": "Hi all - wondering if somebody can help me with a solution! A client has requested a bespoke labelling system for their blog index page. They want to be able to label their blogs with the type of content it is, for example a Q&amp;A blog would have the colour-coordinated label 'Q&amp;A' and a Podcast post would have the label 'Podcast'.\n\nSo far, we've tried using blog tags as a solution. By displaying HubSpot tags on the blog post itself, it did create a label - however, we're unable to control the ordering of tags in HubSpot, so as soon as we added more than 1 tag to a blog post it would bring through the wrong tag."
