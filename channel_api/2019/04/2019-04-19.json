    "text": "Hi community,\n\nCurrently working on a situation where contacts fill out a form(Not HubSpot form) that is passed to \"CRM A\" then sync to HubSpot from \"CRM A\". The problem with this is I am not seeing the pages they would have visited and be able to build lead scoring about form submissions and page views that would be in the cookie tracking. No website activity is showing? Is this because  HubSpotutk cookie from the visitor's browser could possibly, not being pass in the hs_context parameter with the form submission?",

    "text": "Hi <@UEZJ74UN8>, the `hs_context` is the field on a form where you would pass in the `hutk` cookie, before submitting to the HS forms API. This happens automatically with HubSpot form modules and the HS form embed code, but would need to be custom-coded for a non-HS form.\nThe other layer to this is you're trying to pass the data externally before sending it to HubSpot. Are you passing the `hutk` parameter into CRM A? What API endpoint are you using to send the contact/their form submission to HubSpot?"
