    "text": "Hi everybody,\n\nI'm having issues when trying to create assets with the HubSpot CLI in VS Code. I consistently get an error message reading \"[Error] The request failed\" (screenshot attached). I wish the error message was more explicit.\nI get the same error when trying to create any asset (eg, module). This only happens on the PC provided by my company. If I use the same 'create' CLI commands on my personal computer, they work just fine. I'm wondering if this could be caused by a firewall or another security system on the PC that prevents creating files from the CLI.\n\nDid any of you ever experience this problem?",

Do you use other npm scripts/CLI’s on your work PC without issue? And also wondering if other CLI commands are blocked — like, if you were to try `hs create website-theme` or a fetch from one of your portals using `hs fetch`"
