Adding a few request Ids for reference.\n\n• 2ca5028f-52c8-47a4-b5ec-711752a584fa\n• b6d875f1-6a29-4b52-ac93-46184655db67\n• 3df90966-306a-4003-a44a-ee516f83ce7a\nThe error message shows that the value sent in the payload is not one of the available options (properties are of multi-select type). But I've sent the exact same value as defined &amp; shown in the property on HubSpot.\n\nHelp on this would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks",
