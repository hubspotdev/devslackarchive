    "text": "Hello and nice to digitally meet you all! I have a situation where I have doctors in my database, and I have doctors with MDs, and healthcare professionals without a medical degree. So, when we personalize our emails, it's either \"Hello Steve\" or \"Hello Dr. Smith\" depending on if they have their MD. I have a list of specialties in my CRM and I'm using the logic below to create that list, check against it, and return the appropriate value but it's not working. No matter what I send, it's coming back with \"Hello Dr. Smith\", even when a specialty is on the list so it should return \"Hello Steve\". I'm happy to provide more information if needed. Thank you so much for your assistance!

    "text": "I would check if the internal name for those values is normalised (eg all lower case and _ instead of spaces).\n\nAlternatively you could also consider to have a property that has the Dr value inside if they are a Dr and else nothing inside - then you could include that in your personalisation tokens.\n\nBut you would need access to Workflows for that to work, so maybe the first suggestion is better."
