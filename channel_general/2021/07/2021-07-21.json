We think that the problem is that the whole file structure that is generated isn’t working within HubSpot just because the app.js is looking for a specific assets folder. Does someone have experience with this and is possible to add and make it working within a HubSpot environment? (Locally we got the site working, we just can’t get it active in Hubpot)",

You can get around this two ways, my preferred is changing you vue delimiters.)\n\nThere’s a decent vue + HubSpot boilerplate to use as an example, mentioned in that article"
