    "text": "Hey <@U07CK7UER34>, as far as I know there is none since creating themes from scratch is something that is very advanced and personalized to the specific usecase. Therefore creating a course that will show the creation of a theme from scratch isn't that feasable. I'm thinking about creating an own course about \"where to start with themes from scratch\" but it takes quite a lot of time.\nSomething I've shown in a previous DHUG(Developer HUG) was my personal atomic-design/component folder structure for themes. You can find the video here: <https://www.youtube.com/live/dBJZetIHRJM?si=kDqaNASYRcVSbLyG>\n\nAlso feel free to join the <#C078WQGGXPB|dhug-community> here in the slack channel"
