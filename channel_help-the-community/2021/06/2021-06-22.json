    "text": "Hi folks,\nFirst time here, and I see a lot of channels - hope I’m in the right place. I’m pulling Contacts data via Fivetran (data replication platform). It works great so far except that a particular property I’m after “First Conversion” is not coming through in the data. It’s a HubSpot created property and it’s internal name is `first_conversion_event_name`.  Any idea why a property may not come through? Is there a setting I’m missing?",
