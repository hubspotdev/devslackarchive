    "text": "Hi fellow HubSpot Developers :wave: Today I have a simple question:\nWhere can I see in HubSpot if a mail for a forms' recipient has actually been generated? I cannot find anything more than the \"submissions\" on the form page, which show the submitted form data and the form submitter. But there is no information about the recipient! Is there somekind of e.g. a mailserver log to check if actually a mail has been generated and sent by HubSpot? I searched the web and this slack channel for answers, but sometimes answers seem to be more complicated than questions, if they even exist.\nMaybe you can share more insights on this! Thank you.",

    "text": "Hi everyone,\nWe do monthly maintenance for our WordPress clients -- things like plugin updates (we don't let them update automatically because we prefer to check for collisions immediately rather than risk a call from the client asking what happened), server performance report review, vulnerability report review, etc. HubSpot covers a lot of this automatically, but we'd like to make sure we're covering all the bases with our HS clients as well. For those of you who do \"scheduled maintenance\" on your sites, what do you do?",
