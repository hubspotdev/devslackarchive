I submitted a question to support regarding the \"custom_form_html\" param in the HUBL form tag, and after a couple back-and-forths (the rep kept pointing me to the API, but I only wanted to know options available for the one param not anything with the API), I'm told that support isn't the best place to get answers like that, instead I should post on in the community.  So is there 'official' support for dev or is the best place to find the HubSpot developer support reps is in the community forums? thanks",

It comes with a script that handles the blocking of cookies until a user gives consent, by changing the src to data-suppressedsrc attribute and having a special class name. However, I can’t find a way to edit the HS script tag to reflect this method. I tried to use another script to change the #hs-script-loader tag after the page load, but looks like the script still ran, as the leadflow and hs-analytics scripts were added to the document head. Looking at the Networks tab in debugger mode, it looks like the script has loaded by the time my script runs\n\nI know there is an option in Reports Settings to handle the HubSpot cookies internally, but we would like to stick with Iubenda if possible so the consent/script-blocking method can be easily extended to other services as needed, and can be added into smart content to behave differently per region.",
