    "text": "Anyone else found themselves always hitting \"save and go to module list\" by default when they are editing a repeating item in a module? Probably just a habit that needs to be broken. When I want to edit multiple repeating items you have to remember to hit apply and then hit the little back link at the top to go to the list of repeating items. Any better way to approach this from an editing/button standpoint? Almost wish the \"Save and go\" button would just take you back to the list of items rather than the list of ALL modules on the page.",
