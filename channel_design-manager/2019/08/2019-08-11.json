Is this correct? if so, how are others dealing with this. we'd like to simply have a different title tag from an H1 tag for each post. I did find a hacky way of doing this (<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Blog-template-Having-a-different-h1-and-page-title/td-p/18106>). but even simpler, we'd like to append `| Guru` to the end of each title tag. just hoping I missed some documentation somehow."
