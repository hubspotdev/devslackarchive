    "text": "Hi Daniel,\n\nYou are right to use the ‘Sandbox’ portal as a ‘dev site’. And you are also right that it is not possible to import the pages or database into your dev environment. HubSpot does have a beta to import all blog pages from an external site, so you could give that one a try.\n\nWhen fetching the production portal, make sure that all assets are available as well. If a stylesheet is not available, you should check if you fetched the right folder or if any errors are shown in the terminal. You could also try to fetch the file itself instead of everything in the Design Tools."
