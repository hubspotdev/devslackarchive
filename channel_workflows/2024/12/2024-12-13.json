    "text": "Hello ! we noticed during this week that whenever we try to change an existing custom code chunk ( code changes ) upon save code outputs are overwritten . As a result the following actions which use some of the outputs show error messages. Despite the fact that HubSpot workflow UI shows these error messages workflows work normally.. So we are obliged now to fill again manually all the outputs in every change we make.\nIs this a known issue?",

    "text": "Hi. New to this community. We have Operations and are trying to implement a workflow with custom code for deduplication of companies, however we are having trouble with one property in particular (and maybe more, who knows). In the screenshot, on the documentation guide, it shows a destinationCompanyID. However, when I click on add property, there is no such property available to me. Unfortunately, the doc guide doesn't say where this property came from or how to get it, so I'm a bit lost. Any ideas?",
