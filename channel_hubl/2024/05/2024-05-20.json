And just for testing, I set this up.\n\nI have this code set globally. When I view my homepage, the correct information is displayed as a class. But when I view my “Communication Preferences” page that is from emails, the information is not correct.\n\nMaybe I missed some documentation, but is there a reason contact properties are not being displayed correctly on a Communication Preference page? For the record, the preference page is displaying an email, but not mine, so the code is partially working. Thanks in advance!",
