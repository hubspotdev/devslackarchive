    "text": "Hi all! New to the community - didn't even know it existed! Looking for a HubSpot developer who can create landing page template files (nothing complex, pretty basic), for contract hourly work. We are a growth agency with a number of clients on HubSpot and need to replace a developer who just dropped a project. Looking for someone within 4 hrs timezone of Pacific time. We are very flexible - whole company works remote - if you're looking to pick up extra hours in a week and want an ongoing paid gig - DM with your hourly rate and experience. Thanks!\nEdited to add: Absolutely NO agencies please! We are looking for a freelance contractor only. Thanks!",
