    "text": "Hey all, have an interesting question about the CRM Search API. Specifically I am trying to get a list of all contacts with an associated company. I’m POSTing to `<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search>`. If I use the following body to search for a contact with a specific associated company everything works as expected and I get a result:\n```{\n    \"filters\": [\n        {\n            \"propertyName\": \"associations.company\",\n            \"operator\": \"EQ\",\n            \"value\": \"8939399016\"\n        }\n    ]\n}```\nHowever, _my goal is to get all contacts with associations_ so I am attempting to use the following body:\n```{\n    \"filters\": [\n        {\n            \"propertyName\": \"associations.company\",\n            \"operator\": \"HAS_PROPERTY\"\n        }\n    ]\n}```\nThis returns a rather cryptic error:\n```{\n    \"status\": \"error\",\n    \"message\": \"There was a problem with the request.\",\n    \"correlationId\": \"1099786d-15af-4c28-a762-57b86ec0bb94\"\n}```\nDoes anyone know what I’m doing wrong? Or is this functionality simply not avaiable? If so does anyone have ideas about how to get this information? I’m ultimate looking to calculate the percentage of the contacts in the portal that have companies associated to them (Contacts with Companies/Total Contacts). Any insights or ideas greatly appreciated.",

Maybe try a not so elegant workaround, trying ‘contains_token’ instead, and inserting a 1 or something?\n\nOr, if you want to search for the companies directly, you could search via the HubSpot default property available on companies: “num_associated_contacts”, label Number of Associated Contacts.\n\nOtherwise, you could set up a calculated property based on count of associated companies on the contact, and continue querying through contacts."

I didn’t have much luck with contains token… it seems to function like EQ, I got a result when I entered an exact match for Company but it if just entered “1” I got no result back, even though I know a company contains a 1. A wildcard (*) simple produced an error.
