    "text": "Hey Christopher, I'd recommend a few things here:\n1. Use the <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@HubSpot/api-client|HubSpot node.js client library> in your coded action, it makes the syntax a little bit easier (though, it's easiest to explore this library in a local code editor like VScode. This library then uses the most up to date version of the HubSpot APIs  -<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/search| view the v3 Search endpoint docs>\n2. The use case you're presenting is slightly strange - looking up any potential contact that's a customer in a deal based workflow is an atypical pattern - usually you'd want to do something like find an association of a contact that's associated to the deal that triggered the workflow (Remember that when a Deal workflow fires, it's enrolling that single deal record)\n3. You might also want to look at the <https://www.HubSpot.com/programmable-automation-use-cases|Programmable Automation use case library> for some inspiration on how folks are building other usage patterns with coded actions. \nIn any case, the code you'd want to run. Note that you'll swap out the 'firstname' field and the value 'Robert' that I'm using in this sample:\n```const HubSpot = require('@HubSpot/api-client');\n\nexports.main = async (event, callback) =&gt; {\n  /*****\n    How to use secrets\n    Secrets are a way for you to save API keys and set them as a variable to use anywhere in your code\n    Each secret needs to be defined like the example below\n  *****/\n\n  const HubSpotClient = new HubSpot.Client({\n    apiKey: process.env.HAPIKEY\n  });\n\n  let results;\n  try {\n    const ApiResponse = await HubSpotClient.crm.contacts.searchApi.doSearch({\n    \"properties\":[\"email\",\"firstname\",\"lastname\"],\n      \"filterGroups\":[\n        {\n          \"filters\":[\n            {\n              \"propertyName\": \"firstname\",\n              \"operator\": \"CONTAINS_TOKEN\",\n              \"value\": \"Robert\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    });\n    results = ApiResponse.body;\n    console.log(results)\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n    // We will automatically retry when the code fails because of a rate limiting error from the HubSpot API.\n    throw err;\n  }\n}```"
