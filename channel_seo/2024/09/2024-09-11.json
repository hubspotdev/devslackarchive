The website was fine, but then this 404 error randomly showed up and tanked their website health score all at once. It's weird because the 404 pages are not actually showing up as 404 pages when clicking the link to the page. ",

It concerns me that if that keeps happening, Google will think those pages are gone and de-index those pages. I brought it up to HubSpot support the first time, then closed the ticket out the next day when it was over so nothing really came of it."
