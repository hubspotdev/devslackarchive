Very sorry for the way I handled things. Just for future reference though, that right side code sample isn't tied to the api specs but the left side bar is, so I wouldn't follow it 100% of the time"

    "text": "Hi people - looking for some confirmation on a detail when using the v4 associations API.\n\nThe v4 associations api has a 500 per page, 1000 per “call” limit. I want to avoid hitting that 1000 limit.\n\nIf I use the “after” query param - that won’t count as the same call, will it?\n\n\nIt’s using the paging.next.link token that will lead it to being grouped with the previous call, no?\n\nOtherwise, how would you even go about retrieving associated records if the total count is above 1000 when using this endpoint.\n\nOn a somewhat related note, I see they’ve changed how they use the “after” param, at least for this one. Used to be/is based on the count of the returned results per page for the v3 endpoints. So if you were using the search endpoint - limit= 100, after = 0 - 1st page,  after = 100 - 2nd page, and so on. But upon hitting 10,000 total - you’d get an error if you tried to go beyond. Which, while annoying, could be worked with by sorting by create date or something and using the last returned record ID as a filter in the subsequent calls. They’re using the last returned object’s ID as the token now, presumably based on an ascending sort.\n\nAppreciate it."
