    "text": "Thank you to everyone that has tested the private beta. We’ve seen some inspiring use cases and look forward to seeing what others build. Here are some recent updates that we’ve made:\n\n• *3rd Party Dependency Support:* We are now allowing the use of 3rd party NPM dependencies, giving you the flexibility to use additional libraries and frameworks to enhance your development experience.\n• *SSL Support in cms-dev-server 0.4.0:* We now support SSL in our development server for convenience and privacy. To use SSL, you will need to add the ‘domains’ scope by updating your personal access key at <https://app.HubSpot.com/personal-access-key/>&lt;<https://app.HubSpot.com/personal-access-key/%3Cportal-ID%3E%7C&lt;portal-ID>&gt;&gt;  and passing a `--ssl` option to hs-cms-dev-server.\n• *Storybook JS Support Added:* We have added initial support for <https://storybook.js.org/|Storybook> to make it easier to test modules and UI components in isolation and collaborate with team members. <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-js-building-blocks-hello-world/tree/storybook-example|Here is an example branch using Storybook.> \n• *JS Rendering Portal Identification:* We’ve made it easier to identify which portals are currently enabled for JavaScript rendering. Portals enrolled in the JS Rendering beta will now show “JavaScript Rendering Enabled” in the Sprocket Menu. ",

    "text": "And here’s some more info on how to use custom npm dependencies in your JS components:\n• Add the deps you’d like to the deeper `package.json` (the one in the same folder as `cms-assets.json`).\n• You’ll also need to make sure the `cms-dev-server` dep is moved from the root to the deeper `package.json` (already changed in the hello world repo for a couple weeks)\n• So as usual those new deps will be available in the dev server after you do a yarn/npm install \n• _And_ those dependencies will now be included in the build &amp; deploy process\nSo please check it out! We’re eager to see how you folx bring in all the wonderful things in the React npm ecosystem to your beta components! :female-astronaut:"
