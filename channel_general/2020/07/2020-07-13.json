I'm coming from Typo3 where the code is open-source, can be installed on self-hosted server and can be easily extended in many ways (Database, Core functions etc). How is HubSpot flexible?",

    "text": "Hey Philippe, unlike a lot of other CMSs, HubSpot is less of an \"application\" and more of a SaaS product. It's closed-source and managed on behalf of the user. I think it's more helpful to compare HubSpot to something like Firebase or DigitalOcean rather than compared to WordPress or Drupal. You code on top of their platform, and they have multiple tools that require developers, but you can't change their UI or database structure, for example.\n\nThat said, there's a pretty great API, so extending HubSpot using microservices or custom apps is definitely possible."
