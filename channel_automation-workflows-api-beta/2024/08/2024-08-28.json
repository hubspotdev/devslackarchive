    "text": "Hi Team - We are having a challenge with the new workflow's API where we can't create a workflow that has a trigger to only run once.  More details from our team are below.  Any thoughts on when this might be added in or if this is a bug?\n---\n\nHubSpot Flow API supports params for the new feature.\nHubSpot flow definition\n\nHowever, after creating a workflow via API, the trigger type is displayed incorrectly, as if it is not applied.  It defaults to \"YEARLY\"\n\n```\"enrollmentSchedule\": {\n        \"timeOfDay\": {\n            \"hour\": 0,\n            \"minute\": 0\n        },\n        \"type\": \"YEARLY\",\n        \"month\": \"AUGUST\",\n        \"dayOfMonth\": 30\n    },```\nThis is either a bug or the HubSpot team is still working on it. Since there are no changes related to this feature in the documentation for this API.\n\nPerhaps we should wait a little before updating our templates.",
