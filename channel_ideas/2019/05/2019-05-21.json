    "text": ":bulb: Add a way for someone to edit global modules when they are viewing a blog listing page so they don't have to go into design manager. For example, on a blog we built, we used a CM for a featured post module where they can use the page field selector to choose the featured post. In order for them to update, they have to go through the DM and do this in the module options because the blog listing page isn't technically a \"page\" that can be edited."
