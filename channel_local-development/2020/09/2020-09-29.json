    "text": "Andrej we’re definitely looking to make developing with the CLI better, and improve the sandbox experience.\n\nCMS Hub is deeply integrated with all of the HubSpot tools. The platform undergoes thousands of updates every day. We want to ensure that when you preview your work, you can know confidently how it will look and act in the absolute latest version of HubSpot. Maintaining a simulated environment that encapsulates the full power and capabilities of HubSpot in it’s entirety and updating it every time a change occurs would make it near impossible for you as a developer to keep up.\n\nThere is also some technology that you can’t really test locally, for example image resizing with the HubL `resize_image_url()` function which utilizes our CDN to resize the images. So we don’t feel the local dev experience could be as good as a hybrid approach.\n\nSo right now that means our recommended approach is using a CMS Sandbox account to build on then pushing your content to  your production portal once ready.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/creating-an-efficient-development-workflow>\n\n\nWe think there is a lot more we can do to make development easier locally, and we would love to hear your feedback."
