However, to streamline their process they asked me to build them some templates but I notice that HS's email editor supports only CTA from the rich text editor. How might I go about creating a simple button module that can be toggled/moved around as well as also being able to change the destination of the link? Does that make sense?\n\nThanks for the help!",
