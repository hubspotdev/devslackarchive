For the blog with multiple language variant it works fine. but my concern is to how I can prevent the header to not populate the language option on my HTML based on checking the availability of the language version of the specific article. In short I want to know the condition that we can use to identify if the current article has any other language version or not!\n\nWaiting for the help ASAP! :pray:",
