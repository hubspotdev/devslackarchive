Does anyone know, if there is some kind of opporunity to realize this case. As far as I can see the product properties don't offer a field for a \"default\" percentage, but maybe there is another way around this.\nI'd be very happy about some suggestions.\n\nThank you so much\n\nAndi",

    "text": "Hi guys. We're looking for a way to log the IP Address of a user when a marketing subscription is confirmed via an opt in email. As in: User subscribes to a marketing email, receives a double opt-in mail, clicks the link to confirm. We need to log which IP has confirmed which recipient email address. Is there any clever way we could do this? I was looking into a way to use the after confirmation landing page but I don't see how I could figure out which email address has been confirmed. Any ideas?",
