    "text": "Hi - Has anyone had any success with tracking external pages in HubSpot reports?\n\n_For reference : I display my HubSpot blog on an external site using the api._\n\nI found this section in the tracking code guide\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/reports/install-the-HubSpot-tracking-code#additional-code-to-bucket-data-into-HubSpot-page-types>\n\nI’m building out a regex table in tag manager to to insert the correct page type `https:\\/\\/<http://www.mysite.com|www.mysite.com>\\/blog\\/(?!(author|topic|page-([0-9]+))).+`\n\nThis current blog regex excludes any topic, author and pagination pages\n\nThen in tag manager I have the `_hsq.push` script in a custom html tag.\n```&lt;script&gt;\n  if({{website pagetypes to HubSpot}} !== '') {\n    var _hsq = window._hsq = window._hsq || [];\n    _hsq.push(['setContentType', {{website pagetypes to HubSpot}}]);\n  }\n&lt;/script&gt;```\nDoes the HubSpot tracking code need to be loaded first for this script to trigger?\n\nI’m testing this for now with blog posts using preview mode in tag manager, but hope to add in additional settings for website pages and external landing pages\n\nThanks"
