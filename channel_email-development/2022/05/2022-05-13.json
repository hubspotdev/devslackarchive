One section of the email is using a white color for the background and in some email clients with dark mode it changes the color of the background and text.\n\nBut the client wants to have the same style for light and dark mode.\n\nI tried targeting the element with css selectors, using !important, using svg or images as backgrounds and I can’t solve the problem"

    "text": "<@U03F2QX669X> Dark mode is an entirely different issue (learn more here: <https://www.litmus.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-dark-mode-for-email-marketers/>), and some email clients are challenging to control for that, if at all. You should educate your clients to embrace dark mode, and not try to enforce a light-based design in dark mode. This can hurt the eyes for a lot of people, and not be a great experience with the brand. People use dark mode for a reason."
