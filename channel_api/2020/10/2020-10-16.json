However I would like to use the newest available API version.\n```\"request_contact\": {  \n    \"identifier\": \"xx@yy.zz\", ```\nIs it not possible to get contact by email in `v3` in any way?",

So, for the above example, both children are satisfying workflow conditions so *it is triggering two emails to the same contact*.
