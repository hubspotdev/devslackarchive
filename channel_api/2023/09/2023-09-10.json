Can anyone point us in the right direction?\n\nFrom what I can see in the Community section a Playbooks API is not publicly available: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Playbook-API/m-p/404425>\n\nBut I can see that the Slack App uses Playbook data via their integration: <https://app.HubSpot.com/ecosystem/23485196/marketplace/apps/sales/sales-enablement/slack>\n\nAre there certain API's that are only made available to the large apps? Or is there a way we can get access too?\n\nThank you in advance!"
