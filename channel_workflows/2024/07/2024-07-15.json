    "text": "Hi! I'm currently using a webhook subscribed to association changes via a private app in HubSpot to fire at a third party software (Make) to then make adjustments in HubSpot.\n\nThe reason I've done this is so I can fire one webhook and have a branched scenario in Make based on the association type (deal to contact, company to deal... etc)\nEverything I need to do can be done in a HubSpot workflow, but I cannot get the enrolment criteria right on a workflow to move this over to HubSpot entirely. I hoped I could use the webhook i'm currently firing form within HubSpot, back into a HubSpot workflow (but after trying, and with some googling it seems you cannot do that).\nI'd like to move this away from Make now where possible, as we're burning through operation costs quickly.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how to trigger a workflow based on association changes? (contact/deal/company!)\nMy only current though is to fire my webhook to Make, and then have it fire a webhook BACK to HubSpot that I can use as the trigger but that seems a messy solution.",
