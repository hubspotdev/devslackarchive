    "text": "I tinkered with this for a little while and couldn't find a direct way to get everything in one go. The most \"straight-forward\" approach I could find was using _associations_. There are two ways to pull association data:\n• Associations API via POST - `/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/read`\n• Objects API via GET - `/crm/v4/objects/{fromObjectType}/{objectId}/associations/{toObjectType}`\n```{fromObjectType} - Either contacts or emails\n{toObjectType} - Either emails or contacts\n{objectId} - Most likely ContactID you are searching for```\nIn both of these situations, you'll get a list of all the email IDs that you can plug into the CRM Objects API for emails `/crm/v3/objects/emails` to find more information about each specific email - like the status of the email.\n\nI hope this helps! Maybe someone will come up with a better way to solve this problem. For more information about how associations work, here is a link to the guide I used:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/api/crm/associations/associations-v4>"

The way we do this is by using v1 endpoints as the email events are yet to be ported to v3.\n\nusing /email/public/v1/events, you will see the email addresses under response['events']['recipient'] when you loop thru the events. using the email, you can then look up the contact record via the profile end point or a local DB if you have a data lake as we do,\n\nWe also use the campaign end point (/email/public/v1/campaigns and /email/public/v1/campaigns/{id}) to get the info for the email campaign."

I'll be using that in the future.\n\nMy brain immediately ran to associations (assuming Oliver wanted to use this in their app). If you were hoping to go this route, you can use the CRM Associations API using the Batch Read POST endpoint `/crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/read` and you can give it a list of contact IDs you want to find an association for using the `inputs` property in your json body.\n\n```{fromObjectType} - contacts\n{toObjectType} - companies\n\njson body = {\n    \"inputs\": [\n        { \"id\": \"contactId1\" }, \n        { \"id\": \"contactId2\" }, \n         ...\n    ]\n}```\nThis will return a results list with any associated companies for a given contactID.\n\nGood luck!"
