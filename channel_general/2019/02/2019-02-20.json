I’ve used it in projects but honestly I’ve mostly resorted to not using it now unless I run into a serious performance issue, as the browsers automatically handle performance for animations fairly well.\n\nThe implementations for browsers have changed a few times on how will-change kicks in. the basic understand I have though is that will-change should generally be set by javascript(or a css class that is added by javascript) before an animation is triggered, to make it more efficient. leaving it always there, is a bad thing performance wise"
