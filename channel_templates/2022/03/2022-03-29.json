    "text": "Hey Jack, this means that the templates you are working with were built using the old “visual builder” system. These JSON files are fine for version control for historical purposes, but if you’re looking for templated HTML files, you would need to do the following steps:\n\n1. Open the design manager tool in your portal and identify the templates you wish to work with\n2. Right click a template and select “show dependents” to view the pages currently using this template and take note of them (I usually open them in a new tab for easy access)\n3. Exit the dependents view and right click the template again, this time selecting “Clone to HTML” and name your new asset accordingly\n4. For each of the dependent pages, swap the template source from the original asset to the new HTML version so the two are linked going forward\n5. Download your new templates using the same `fetch` command and commit them to your version control system."
