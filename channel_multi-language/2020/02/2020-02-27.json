I guess I could set up a workflow that would automatically assign the Distributor properties based on the contact country because this email is being sent. Is there any way to link a HubDB table to properties? That would make life a little easier so distributors could be stored and maintained in one place."

    "text": "<@UGY22E2KC> Do you happen to know what kicks off first - the follow-up email or a workflow? I ask because if a new contact fills out a form we would need the workflow to assign the distributor details before sending the follow-up email. I guess this means instead of using the built-in follow-up I would need to set steps to the workflow - first to assign the distributor and next to send the followup email?"
