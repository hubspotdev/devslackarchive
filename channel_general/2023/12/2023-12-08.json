Then the customer answers some questions and we capture these leads. Previously, through Webhook, we connected to Zapier, our old CRM tool, the idea would be to connect Respondi with HubSpot through Webhook. So that people fill out our form and their leads come to HubSpot"

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>.
