    "text": "Hello :slightly_smiling_face: I’m having an issue with anchor tags reacting oddly in a module. We have an experts module placed on the homepage, and each expert in the module links to a bio module on the experts page. I added an anchor tag functionality to both modules, and we are using HubDB to pull in the expert data in the expert module. Everything seems to be working fine, but the client is having issues when the click on the expert link on the homepage, it goes to the intended expert bio, but then keeps “jumping” up to a bio above, most of the time it’s catching on a particular bio. I can’t get this issue to duplicate in the same browser he’s having issues with so I’m at a little bit of a loss. Has anyone had this issue with anchor tags and modules and HubDB? TIA!",
