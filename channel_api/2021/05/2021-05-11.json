At the moment, currency exchange rates must be set manually within the web UI, and I'm not aware of any API endpoint that gives you exchange rates set within the given portal.

    "text": "<@U021FM2AYN9> one good way to debug issues like this is to put an interceptor between your code and the HubSpot API.  This way you can see the complete request payload the your code is sending, and the complete response payload the HubSpot is sending back.  That should make it very clear whether the data is in the response or not... if it is, then the problem is with your code that is receiving/parsing/displaying it; if not then you probably want to carefully compare the request your code is sending vs. what Postman is sending.\n\nI'm partial to Beeceptor for this kind of debugging, but there are probably lots of similar services out there.  Take a look at <https://docs.beeceptor.com/docs/features-inspect-requests/> to get started."
