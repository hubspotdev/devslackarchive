Currently have a setup with TW watching for HTML/CSS changes in modules that auto-shake and bundle my code, and then upload the changes to my `build` directory. Instead of using the TW CDN, I get all the power of the toolkit in HubSpot. Happy to share any findings for those interested in learning more.",
