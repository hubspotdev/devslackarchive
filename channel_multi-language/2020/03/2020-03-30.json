    "text": "You are correct, not possible but can be done in JS.\nBut it’s not the recommended approach. Many people are bilingual and it’s generally best to let the user control what langauge they’re seeing. If someone goes to your English langauge page, for example, don’t automatically switch them over to Spanish because that’s what their browser is set to. Instead, make sure there’s an obvious langauge switcher option in the header of the site so they can change the langauge if needed."
