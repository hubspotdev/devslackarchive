    "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm looking for insights on a potential workaround for attaching third-party comments to existing meetings on HubSpot records. As the current API doesn't support this, I'm considering the following approach:\n\n1. Utilize the `hs_internal_meeting_notes` field to store comments.\n2. Trigger a workflow whenever `hs_internal_meeting_notes` is updated.\n3. Populate the workflow-triggered value into the comments section.\nBefore proceeding, I'm seeking your insights on the feasibility of this workaround and any potential improvements or alternatives.\n\nThank you in advance!",
