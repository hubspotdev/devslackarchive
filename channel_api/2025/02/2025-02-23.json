Has anyone successfully accessed this property via HubSpotâ€™s API or through another method? Any insights or guidance on how to approach this would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance!"

    "text": "Hi everyone, any advice on this appreciated:\nWe give HubSpot contacts access to our application for 6 - 12 month blocks. When a company purchases the product we agree a start date, a period duration and a key user. The key user has access to an application where they can add or remove colleague's access. We are considering how best to set this up in HubSpot. Should we add a new field to company for application_start_date and application_duration which then triggers a webhook when today's date is equal to the application_start_date which creates a user in Auth0? Or is this there a better way of doing this within HubSpot?"
