I mean, no?\n\nNM, the deal would be unenrolled in the workflow resulting in an error, how it works now is I update the old deal and then archive the \"new\" one (actually same deal but updated data via integration and doing PATCH stuff in the other end is not feasible because need to map other end's status to dealstage etc.) which also results in the workflow erroring b/c the enrolled deal got deleted so it's not exactly _optimal_ but hey"
