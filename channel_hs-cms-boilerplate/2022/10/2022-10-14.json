    "text": "Hey everyone :wave-yeti: we just released a new minor version of the boilerplate (v3.6: <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/releases/tag/v3.6.0>). The main couple of updates here are adding payments as an option in the pricing card module and fixing a bug with the gap width in the updated grid. Special thanks to <@UDHT6N5SM> for reporting the bug with the new grid. We will add issues to the v3.7 project board as we work there (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/projects/19>) but please let us know if there are things you'd like to see in boilerplate that aren't already reflected in the open issues in the time being (<https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-requests>)!"
