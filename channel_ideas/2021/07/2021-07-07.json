    "text": "*Background:*\n\nI found this nice and useful database API, which give me the idea. Buts the translated countries names are missing in that DB, so I thought in some cases a translator function would be helpful. \n<https://www.back4app.com/database/back4app/list-of-all-continents-countries-cities>\n\nI need the country names as a lookup table, to get additional information for a blog-tag. So if the blog article is tagged with \"Deutschland\" / Germany, I want to get Europe and an Emoji-Unicode or Flag Icon from the lookup table. In the end, there is a filter and sorting JavaScript based on isotope.js for the Blog-Listing pages. And now I have to bridge between German tags and the English database."
