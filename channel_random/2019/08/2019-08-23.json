    "text": "chromium edge will bring with it an internet explorer compatibility feature, that essentially makes it so for big companies that have specific old intranet apps that don’t play well with modern browsers IT people can set those specific sites to use the IE mode. Users will still be in the same browser but will have their rendering engine downgraded and supports for legacy things like activex and all that will be available.\n\nFrom the IT perspective it’s a no-brainer to upgrade. No loss of access to legacy apps, and dramatically improved security and performance"
