I have a few questions that I’m looking for help with and our rep sent us here, so just gonna lay these out here and see what happens.\n\n1. is it possible to have a clear header that  displays as part of a hero image?\n    a. we want a menu that navigates to tags on the page to make a 1 page style menu. \n        i. if not i will probably do it via rich text boxes and HTML\n2. is it possible to negative margin pictures to make them bigger when split into two columns?\n    a. I have the picture next to the column, but it won’t get bigger with negative margin, just stays the same size and moves left. \n        i. can’t change column size or the form looks off\ni can also provide screenshots",
