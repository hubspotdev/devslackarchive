    "text": "Hi everyone :wave:, I need a solution to customize the Tabber module and make each tab have it’s own icon, plus text. I can’t seem to have an unique css selector for each time, nor I am so familiar with HubL to modify the code to include any new custom class to my likings. I can even use raw HTML just for the tabs portion, but I’m not familiar where I would inject that in the HubL code. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!",
