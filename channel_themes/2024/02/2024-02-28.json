    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm trying to make some templates from a marketplace theme unavailable in the child theme.  I've tried cloning those templates to the child theme and setting `isAvailableForNewContent: false` in the template annotations.  However, this doesn't seem to do the trick.  It appears that HubSpot just reverts to showing the template from the parent marketplace theme.  Does anyone know of another way to accomplish this or is it just not possible to do this at this time? Thanks!",
