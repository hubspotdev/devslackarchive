The weird thing, is this flag which should be working, and does work on most tickets, doesn't work on some. I'm 100% confident on a particular ticket, the last message received was in fact from the support team. But the status is still \"True.\"\n\nDoes anyone what's happening behind the scenes for this calculation? They do CC each other on tickets, and this one has some of those. But that shouldn't categorize one of their team members as an visitor.\n\nThe other weird thing, is the calculation ran at 1:57, but the latest emails are at 3:21. Not 1:57. So it's like the calculation didn't run.",
