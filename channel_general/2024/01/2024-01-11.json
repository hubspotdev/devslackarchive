For this, my solution is to create an application in HubSpot and send <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/timeline#endpoint?spec=POST-/crm/v3/timeline|Timeline events>, then have a way for my clients to integrate their HubSpot account with my HubSpot application and thus be able to receive all the events of their users directly in their HubSpot account. Is this how it should be done?\n\nPS: I thought I could change the integration of `Timeline events` for `Segment`, but it seems that I must improve my HubSpot account to `Marketing Hub Enterprise` and it is to expensive\n\nPlease any opinions are welcome",
