    "text": "I'm using HubSpot's cms membership feature to lockdown a custom developed \"member portal\". On the portal I'd like to show customers who log in all of their historical documents that we've produced for them. Right now i'm using CRM objects to display {{ company.file_name1 }} on a \"my documents\" page, which works great. The issue is having to create a company property for each file i'd like to upload and display on the page... Is there a more efficient way to do this where I can upload several in bulk and show dynamically depending on who's logged in?"
