    "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to share a solution for a challenge that many of you may have encountered. When a contact in HubSpot is owned by a deactivated user, there isn’t a built-in feature to easily identify and reassign that contact. To address this, I developed a script that can be used within a custom workflow action. This <https://github.com/aw249/HubSpot-custom-code-actions/blob/main/platform/HubSpot/hs-get-contact-owner-status.js|script> checks whether the contact's owner is active or deactivated, providing a simple way to manage and reassign ownership more efficiently.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance implementing this solution!"
