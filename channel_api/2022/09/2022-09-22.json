For e.g <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/salesforce/install-the-HubSpot-salesforce-integration> its says you need any Salesforce edition with an API enabled or Salesforce professional however Salesforce professional does not come with API access as standard.

Ive posted this <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Can-I-test-pushing-data-to-HubSpot-on-sandbox-account-vs/td-p/696936|question> in HubSpot community, but figure id try asking here. In past when developing pipeline that pushed data to HubSpot via API, i had to create an app developer account and test account in order to test outside of our production HubSpot account. I then had to manually copy over objects, properties, etc. from the prod account into the test account (not a small lift).\n\nThere are now \"sandbox\" accounts which the docs say can be used for testing certain integrations. It appears that these sandbox account have automatic syncing for certain objects in the corresponding production account. There are now other developers on my team who are planning to test pushing data to HubSpot via API using one of these \"sandbox\" account. They are hoping to leverage this because of the fact that there are objects synced from prod and they dont have to go through the heavy lift of creating mirrored objects in the sandbox account. Is this doable? I have seen multiple community questions that _seem_ to suggest we should be using the developer/test account INSTEAD of the \"sandbox\" account for this type of testing (example <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Difference-between-sandbox-and-testing-account/td-p/582804|here>). But i dont see anything in official docs that makes this clear. Can we use a HubSpot \"sandbox\" account to test API integration pushing data to HubSpot?\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/account-types>",
