These pages are actually not existing anymore (but still sending a 200 answer). Those pages are marked as excluded, means that Google doesn't index them right? Must we redirect them?\nSecond question: when I test a page through \"fetch and render as Google\" the screenshot is without css. It says that it's blocked in our robots.txt which is true because I blocked them in order to avoid an indexing from Google. But should I block them or not?\n\nThanks a lot"
