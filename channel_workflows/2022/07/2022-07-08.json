    "text": "*Subject : assign - workflows - code* \n\nHi from France :fr: ,\nWe would like to `assign a specific owner to a company` in some cases. Without having a *workflow* where we designate the person.\nI am trying to avoid monster spider workflows.\n\nExample: *Jason is the unique owner of company X. He will then be the owner of all associated objects.*\nBut, companies Y and Z are randomly assigned to a team member.\n\nMy first solution was to send the DB &gt; a Gsheet &gt; HighTouch sync to update the property.\nOR using code in the workflow - call the owner in DB.\n\n\n&gt; *Have you ever seen this issue in the community or used code in a workflow for specific owners?* \nThanks :sunny:",
