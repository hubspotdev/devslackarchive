Can you confirm that you have a menu setup in settings? *Settings &gt; Website &gt; Navigation.*\n\nIt should be pulling in whatever navigation is set to a default nav in the settings there, unless you specify to override that in the module itself.\n\nThat being said if you click on the header element you should bet taken to the Global Partial editor. From there, in the left pane, if you click into the contents tab you should see an element there called `Primary navigation` . If you click on that module you should be able to create/add a menu there."

From there, in the left pane, if you click into the contents tab you should see an element there called `Primary navigation`\nYes, that worked! Thank you!"
