    "text": "Hi everyone, I'm having trouble validating my theme on the marketplace. I've already submitted it several times without any issues, but this time I'm unable to submit it for review. I have a file located at `/theme/modules/macros.html`, which I import into several modules using `{% import '../macros.html' %}.` However, the automatic validation process is triggering an error that says *\"Theme has internal dependency\",* and I'm not sure what's causing the issue. I've also tried using `../../modules/macros.html`, but it doesn't seem to work either. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",
