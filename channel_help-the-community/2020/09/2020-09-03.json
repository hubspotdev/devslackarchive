    "text": "Hi everyone, are there some good tools, plugins, modules and scripts that automatically detect and preload critical css as well as defer non-critical? Wordpress has something similiar called W3 Total Cache, which is interesting.\n\nI've done some research and found the closest thing to automation is using something like js.polyfill to call onload events for unsupported browsers. But even that is the tip of the iceberg it seems. <https://github.com/exiguus/js.polyfill.preload.onload>\n\nany insight is much appreciated!"
