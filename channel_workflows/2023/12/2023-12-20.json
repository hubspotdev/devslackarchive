The logic of the code works but for some reason it is not recognizing that the deal record ID was enrolled into the workflow even though I included  `const dealId = event.inputFields['hs_object_id'];` Is there something that I am missing?\n\nThis is an example of an error I get:\n```Error: Enrolled deal with ID 11742512559 not found.```\n",

Or you could do vice versa if you needed too.\nHere's a link to the app listing page:\n<https://ecosystem.HubSpot.com/marketplace/apps/customer-service/data-management/file-attachment-associations-1549105>\n\nThere's a free 2-week trial if you wanted to kick the tires to make sure it works."
