    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have built a CRM Card that uses a `SERVERLESS_ACTION_HOOK` that pulls data from an external API and updates some custom properties/fields in each Company of our Companies list. It works well, but when it comes to the user experience, I wanted to have the page reload automatically after the information is updated (PATCH request to the Companies API). Is there a way to achieve that? I have tried the usual javascript reload techniques but none of them work which kinda make sense because we are essentially returning a JSON response in the `sendResponse` callback. Not a big deal, but would love to know if there's a solution that autrefreshes the page or the state of the company information after the completion of the serverless action instead of the user to hit the refresh button in the browser.",
