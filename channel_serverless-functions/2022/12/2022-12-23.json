Use the default axios instance provided automatically, which you can get by adding some webpack config a la _`externals: 'axios',`_ which will stop bundling an additional version and fall back to the one already in the environment, and things should Just Work :tm: \n2. Keep bundling a specific axios version but change the axios `require` according to that issue thread :point_up_2: \n3. Keep bundling a specific axios version but change the axios `require` to be an import instead `_import_ axios _from_ 'axios';` – this worked but I am not sure how it combines with all the other webpack config options"
