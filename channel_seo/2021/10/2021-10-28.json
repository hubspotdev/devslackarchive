    "text": "My guess is that they heard feedback that for most landing pages are meant to be limited and targeted in their reach and accessibility (discovered via ppc or an email click), and therefore not intended to be indexed in search results for most. Excluding from the sitemap only discourages crawling but does not block indexing, so it's a safe middle ground call for them to make.\n\nYou can manually add them page by page following these steps: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/domains-and-urls/view-and-edit-your-HubSpot-hosted-domain-sitemap|https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/domains-and-urls/view-and-edit-your-HubSpot-hosted-domain-sitemap>\n\nOur team often noindexes these pages to keep them out of search results. If we want it indexed, we make it a permanent part of our website. \n\nFor us:\nLanding pages = temporary, not indexable\nWebsite pages = permanent , indexable"

    "text": "Thanks Sean for sharing and agree it is a safe middle ground. I am just surprised because the content creators I talked to assumed they were indexed. So I guess the best thing is education and if you want it indexed it takes some type of action (share on social, add to sitemap, or google search console crawl request)"
