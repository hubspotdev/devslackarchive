    "text": "Hey guys, I need some guidance. Problem: We're adding semantic HTML5 tags to our new website (&lt;main&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, etc). basically the issue is that if we open the &lt;main&gt; tag in the above the fold module, we can't close it in (for example) the pre footer module. We have to close it within the same module (in this case, the above the fold one) which is not useful for us. Do you think is there any other workaround other than cloning the template in raw HTML to edit the code directly?",
