Also, I would recommend following the information in our <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started|Quick Start> guide where you can spin up an App Developer Account and then generate testing Hubs for 90 days (which can be renewed from the App Dev Dashboard at any time). As this will allow you to trial the CMS longer."
