    "text": "Right now in this private beta, we’re not supporting server-side fetches from inside JS components (brief mention of this at the end of the _long_ beta document). We  are working toward enabling that, but no specific commitment if/when it will be ready.\n\nAs for GraphQL and API limits for future server-side calls inside JS components, we don’t have a specific answer yet. Generally I believe we want the limits when running data fetches inside HS infra (i.e. GraphQL referred to from a HubL template or inside a JS module/partial) to be higher and more flexible than the limits for external API requests. But there are many details there for us to work out.\n\nThanks for the feedback, we hear your pain around limits."
