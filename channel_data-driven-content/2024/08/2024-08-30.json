    "text": "Quick question, since the new update where a dropdown in HubDB will use a developer friendly internal value for the options, we are seeing issues with how this is shown in Foreign ID columns. For example, if I have a table with a dropdown column ‘Example’, the label for the options will be ‘Hello world’ and the internal value will be ‘hello_world’. When I create another table and point the foreign ID to that column, it will show ‘hello_world’ instead of ‘Hello world’. When I access the data of the row that contains the ‘Foreign ID’ column, I can only access the ‘hello_world’ value. I do not want to use HubL to retrieve that specific row based on the foreign ID, because I would quickly hit a limit there. Anyone who ran into this issue and found a solution?\n\nCC: <@U07JVS2RHGA>"
