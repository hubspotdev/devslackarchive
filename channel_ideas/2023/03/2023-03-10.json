    "text": "Hi there, new to the space but have an idea.\n\nOur company has a lot of duplicate Companies being created from new email domains that enter the system via webforms (in many cases these domains are different versions of a core domain (<http://att.com|att.com> &amp; <http://mobile.att.com|mobile.att.com>)\n\nNot too long ago HubSpot released the ability to add multiple domains on an account making it possible to have many domain versions on one Company record. This is helpful but makes it so we have to routinely go through duplicate Companies the system makes, add the new domain to the original record, then merge.\n\nIf HubSpot offered a service where they would append all known domains to Company records, all inbounds would route correctly the first time. This has to be a shared problem among many HubSpot users, so I'm sure others would pay for this service like our company would.\n\nHas anyone experienced this and come up with a good solution? One thing to note is we are integrated with SalesForce so the native Company dedup feature HubSpot provides is unavailable."
