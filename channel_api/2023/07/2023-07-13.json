I'm trying to build a public app. I have followed the authentication with Oauth as part of the \"Integrating With HubSpot I: Foundations\" course and it is working, meaning I can install an app on a given account.\nHowever now Im rather lost on what to do next for a functional app. I know you can create custom workflow actions but how exactly do I connect them to my app? How can I create a bidirectional sync between platforms? I know there are webhooks you can set up on public app, but to be honest I dont know where to place the code that executes when that worfkflow is triggered.",
