This is a wholistic library of code for a lot of things unrelated to HubSpot - but I've written a good amount of adapters for HubSpot embedded content like forms, chat, video, and meetings.\n\nFor anyone who works heavily with adtech/martech tools and commonly need to integrate them with HubSpot tools, these will be worth their weigh in gold.\n\n*You can find the HubSpot specific adapters here:*\n<https://github.com/derekcavaliero/gtm-adapters/tree/main/adapters/HubSpot>"
