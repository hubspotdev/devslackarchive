    "text": "Hello everyone. I have a simple automated email where there are a bunch of personalization tokens. Most of them are numbers (deal props).\n\nWhat is weird is that even if the HS portal is set to Italian (as a language, as a locale for numbers/currency formatting ecc.) numbers are indeed displayed correctly across the portal (that is, a number with dot as thousands separator and comma as decimals separator as I desire, say a deal property \"test_number\" written as 1.234,56) but when I send an email with that personalization token it is displayed as 1,234.56, as if it was printed assuming another locale format.\n\nI was thinking about building a custom module that could print personalization tokens in a loop, entered by the customer from the editor (and I was successful), but the problem is to handle that number format: since we're dealing with emails, no javascript here (otherwise it would be as simple as `Number(n).toLocaleString('de-DE')` ) and no HubL either (am I right?)\n\nGiven that HubL is rendered on the server side (so do the personalization tokens that will be replaced by actual values at send time, right?), do you think this is not possible?\nThank you so much in advance",
