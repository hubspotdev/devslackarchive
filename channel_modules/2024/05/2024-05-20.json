    "text": "Is anyone else experiencing an issue with repeater fields in custom modules on blog posts?\n\nInteracting with a repeater field in a custom module on blog posts breaks the editor for that instance of the module in every portal I have access to. I've reached out to support but they have not escalated it yet. I created a blank module to see if it would occur with fields alone and the issue is still present. I can reproduce the issue with the steps below.\n\nIs anyone else able to replicate what I am experiencing?\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a new custom module available to blog posts\n2. Add a text field and turn on repeating\n3. Publish the module\n4. Add the custom module to a blog post\n5. Click to add a text field repeater item\n6. The editor will break and throw the error described previously\n7. Refreshing the page will not fix the error and that instance of the module will not be usable",
