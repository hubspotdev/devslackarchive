    "text": "<@U03C2KEE06L> I'm not sure if you'd run into auth issues switching the install URL after implementation. couple of quick thoughts without knowing how your app is configured or what it does.\n\n1. On the webapp side add a variable for `prod`, i.e. you're fully qualified install URL (<http://www.example.com|www.example.com>) as well as a variable for `dev`. Use one of the existing portals sandbox URLs, i.e. <http://XXXXX.hs-sites.com|XXXXX.hs-sites.com> or <http://company-XXXXX.hs-sites.com|company-XXXXX.hs-sites.com>. that gives you a production and development URL to test against.*\n2. Do you have a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/get-started|HubSpot Dev account> setup? Use the Hs Developer account as your testbed, paired with a staged instance of your webapp running on AWS. Test `AWS stage` against `Hs Dev`, then deploy to prod on your standard release cycle\n_*CMS Starter does not have access to HubDB, Content Staging or Sandboxes, so there are quirks to watch out for especially regarding Draft vs Published content states and their respective URLs_"
