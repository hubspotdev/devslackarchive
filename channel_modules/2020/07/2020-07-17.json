    "text": "Hello. About video module in drag and drop in editor (not the old drag and drop system but the new one). When I have a video, it's hidden on mobile (anywhere I put this module, the parent dnd_column receive the \"hidden-phone\" class). I think it's a wanted behavior (to not load video on mobile devices) and not a bug? That's correct?"
