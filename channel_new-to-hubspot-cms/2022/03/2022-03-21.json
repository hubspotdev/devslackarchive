    "text": "Hi Everyone!\n\nQuick question on something I hope one of you might now the answer to ... On our website , we have a \"request a demo\" HubSpot form. I am looking to make this form interactive on two aspects/properties:\n\n1. Marketplace revenue; when high, show meeting link of round robin directly\n2. Region; connect the right round robin of that region.\n\nI have tried using a two step form that saves the first answers as a separate submission; and then using an interactive CTA to lead the visitor to either the meetinglink or the home page. However, the storing of the data and adjusting the CTA takes more than 20 seconds which is too long for my visitors.\n\nAnyone who knows how I can embed the meetings tool based on the user's input? Or how I can make an interactive form like this?\n\nMany thanks!",
