I completly missed this thread, I'm terribly sorry for answering that late, you probably have figured it out by now but just for the record, I did manage to make it work, I missed adding the cache of the node installation to the next step, so the right bitbucket-pipelines.yml file should be the following:\n```pipelines:\n  branches:\n    master:\n      - step:\n          name: 'Install NPM deps'\n          caches:\n             - node\n          script:\n            - npm install\n      - step:\n          name: 'Deploy'\n          caches:\n             - node\n          script:\n            - bin/generate-config.js\n            - bin/deploy.sh    ```"
  }
