We are working on moving to Private Apps but we don't know which of our apps use our API key. I see a list of call logs in our HubSpot account but no information on where it's coming from. If there is no way to know where the calls are coming from, are there any suggestions on what we can do when we move to the private app?",

    "text": "Hi there HS community!\n\nIs there any way to filter by a *date-time stamp AND include associations* from any endpoint for any object or engagement? (I’m trying my best to avoid having to make additional calls when syncing data in the integration I’m working on, and currently I don’t see any endpoint that supports both filtering by any date time stamp AND including associations....so as of now I’d have to search the CRM for any new/updated records for say ‘companies’ in the past 10minutes since the last sync, and then grab all of those record IDs and make a second request PER RECORD for the associations, and then a 3rd request for the property values i’m wanting to pull into the original object to begin with.\n\nI’ve found a workaround where i can only use the Search the CRM functionality and include associated record properties...but the ‘solution’ involves using workflows in the UI to leverage copying and setting property values from one ‘source’ object to a ‘destination’ object which works! But it won’t if the HS account in questions is free or a starter....as those tiers don’t have workflows....It also only works for CRM objects as I don’t see a way to make custom properties/fields for engagements? :thinking_face:\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions?\n\nThe use case is simple….say i’m looking at a ‘meeting’ I want to know who the contact or company is associated with the meeting….as of now i can grab any new or updated meetings in the past 10minutes, but if i want a single array of these ‘meetings’ with un-nested objects per meeting showing the contact and company associated I have to SEARCH the CRM, search for each individual meeting and include associations PER meeting, then a third/fourth request for the contact and company to pull those names into the ‘meeting object’ i’m building out.",
