    "text": "Hey all — Just want to make sure that Im understanding this correctly. — Is it possible to use Marketing Event Objects to create dynamic pages currently? I see that it is an option as a data source for dynamic pages but it would appear that the `\"hasUniqueValue\"`  property needs to be set to `true`  And by default it is set to `false` — It also seems like because this is a default HubSpot object that I cannot set this value to true. If this is the case would it make sense to not display that option as a data source for dynamic pages? Or am I missing a way to change that property?\n\n<@UQERM7BLY> I think I have seen you posting about the `marketing_event` object in the past. Any insight?",

    "text": "`hasUniqueValue` just needs to be set for one property of the marketing event object (it is not the object itself, just a property of the object). If you are creating a new custom property for that object that will be used for the dynamic page slug, you will set that property to `true`"
