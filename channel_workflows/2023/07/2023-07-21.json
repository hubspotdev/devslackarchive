    "text": "Honestly this is a brilliant idea and I want to follow the thread. My initial thought first is to create a zap between where the client submits a form or set a trigger that anytime that field changes to initiate an update and send it to google sheets. From within google sheets, have it connect to the maps feature, and be sure to have a separate layer with the  service reps and their ideal radius for service. I'm betting there is an even more direct way to do it, but as I'm kinda new to coding this was the first thought that came to my mind."
