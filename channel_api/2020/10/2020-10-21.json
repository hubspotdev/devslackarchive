There is an open issue to fix this but there are some bigger performance issues the team needs to tackle first, those ideally would allow us to let a higher request limit than the current 4/second.\n\nTo make sure I’m understanding the issue correctly, you are saying that filtering `closedate` s only works when you using the GT(E) operateros but not when you are looking for deals that closed before a certain timestamp?\n\nAre you seeing any other properties behave this way, or just `closedate` ?"
