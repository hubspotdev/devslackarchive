I have a few questions on a) the sample projects (there seems to be a bug in the iFrame project) and b) passing data to iframes ... I'm not sure if I should post them here, or is the <#CCQ7H31D5|developer-tools> channel a better place?",

I've been looking at `hs_analytics_first_url`, which appeared to be the first URL the user visited. My understanding was that this column would only ever be set once for a Contact, but looking at the property history I can see it's set multiple times for some contacts. Can someone help me understand why this would be set multiple times? Is it based on multiple Contacts being merged? Is there something else I should be looking at to get granular data to try and associate marketing campaign clicks with Contacts that eventually convert into paying customers?"
