I'm fairly new to the platform and so came across a Theme Validation error.\nI've previously released a couple of templates where I didn't come across this error. I couldn't find any resource to get answers or solution to this. Can anyone help me fix it here?\nThanks in advance. :slightly_smiling_face:"
