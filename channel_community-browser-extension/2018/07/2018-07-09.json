    "text": "I think with the next update it would be good to maybe do a beta before pushing it to everyone. \n\nWe’d mark it as a pre-release in github and ask anyone interested to try it. Report any issues, get em fixed, then push live to everyone.\n\nI’ve just noticed some things in the dark theme(the finder search pane needs tweaks), and some strange conditional issues in the injected developer menu I’m working on. Where sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. Want to iron those out before everyone gets the update. \n\nThe dark theme is much better now though. I’m trying to actively use it so we can catch anything that was missed."
