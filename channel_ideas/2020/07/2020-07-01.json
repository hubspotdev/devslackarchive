I asked HubSpot and they don’t see a way to do that, but I was wondering if anyone ever came up with a work around this problem. Thank you. ",

You could craft this as a serverless function that runs every hour, checking for new posts.\n\nYou could also look into Zapier if you're looking for a no/low-code solution."
