At the moment there is no way you can trigger a workflow on data that lives outside of HubSpot.\n\nHowever, the exciting news is that we are actively working on bringing this functionality to the product.\n\nOur next steps are actually to conduct some usability research on the current design and I was wondering if you would be interested in participating in exchange for a $50 gift card?"
