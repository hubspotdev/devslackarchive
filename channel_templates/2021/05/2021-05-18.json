    "text": "Hello everyone! Is there a resource that shows how to customize the membership login form that comes default with HubSpot's? The bit that goes like\n```{% member_login 'my_login'\n          email_label= 'Email',\n          password_label= 'Password',\n          remember_me_label= 'Remember Me',\n          \n          submit_button_text= 'Login',\n          reset_password_text= 'Forgot your password?'\n        %}```\nI basically need to change email to username, as well as add a few icons before the input fields. But I can't quite find any documentation that demonstrates how to do that. Thanks!"
