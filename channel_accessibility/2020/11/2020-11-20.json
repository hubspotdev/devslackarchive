    "text": "Just to add a bit more info to Jon’s comment above, adding in all the required accessibility attributes and features will require us to change the forms markup. We’re working on an entirely new forms markup which we do plan on running a full accessibility audit   on before pushing live, this will also allow us to build out new features and improve existing features for forms.\nObviously changing markup could be a massively breaking change for a lot of customers so we want to ensure we do it right, which is why this isn’t a quick fix we can implement right now.\n\nWe definitely don’t want to roll out any breaking changes to any of our customers, so we’ll be sure to provide as much information and notice on any changes within the changelog as soon as we have any updates.\nKeep any feedback coming though it’s extremely appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:"
