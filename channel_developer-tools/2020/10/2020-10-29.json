    "text": "My client sells stuff and has internal salespeople using HubSpot.   This app is for internal people only. These internal folks don’t care about the branding.  (Their branding appears on their public website which is partially powered by HS CMS.)\n\nMy client very specifically wants HubSpot integrations to look like HubSpot so that the user sees one UI.  I totally agree.  As a UI dev and designer for 30 years I try to avoid Frankenstein UIs and deliver consistency.\n\nAlready HubSpot automatically puts “Powered by XYZ Integration” (the app name) on the CRM Card.  Apps have settings for support URL so that tagline also provides a link to support.  It’s clear enough to the user this is HubSpot.  Anyway these are internal users.  If anything happens in the integration, this small company will know where it came from.\n\nThank you for thinking this though."
