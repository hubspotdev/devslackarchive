    "text": "Heya Ian, I've been having trouble reproducing this on my end for the page field. Here's my process, maybe you can clarify what I should change?\n\n1. Add a module with a Link or URL field to a page. Select page A in the field.\n2. Put page A through content staging, so the page id changes.\n3. For the behavior you're reporting, I'm expecting the Link or URL field is pointing to the archived page A. However, on my end, the field points to the new ID automatically (something we put in a couple months ago).\n\nAnything I'm missing here?"
