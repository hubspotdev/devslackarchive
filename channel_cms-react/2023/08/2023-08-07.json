    "text": "The short answer is no, there is not support for a full React based theme at this point.\n\nWhen you build React modules and partials as documented in the JS Building Blocks beta, they live outside of the concept of a theme. However, you can make use of those modules and partials from within a theme.\n\nWe do have plans to better integrate the JS Building Blocks within themes. That would mean still a \"traditional\" HubL theme, that has JS modules and partials within it.\n\nA full React based theme is certainly something we hope to work toward long term as well. It also helps to continue to hear from developers what features they want most and why. What about a React based theme is important to you?"
