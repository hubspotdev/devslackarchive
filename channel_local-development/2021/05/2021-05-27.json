    "text": "Hey all, hopefully a quick CLI question here:\n\nWe're trying to do some bulk optimization for a client's file manager, bringing down files uploaded by marketers over time, resizing and compressing them, then uploading back.\n\nUsing the CLI's `filemanager fetch` command, we seem to be hitting a limit of 1000 files. We have around 6000 we need to bring down (almost all in the root), and there doesn't seem to be a way to paginate or otherwise batch the request. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/local-development-cli#fetch>\n\n1. Does anyone know a way to either fetch all files OR accurately paginate requests of up to 1000 files using the CLI?\n2. Once we get all the files down and compressed, will we run into a similar issue with the `filemanager upload` command?\n3. If it's unavoidable, can we get this limit specified in the documentation? <@U2H3TT8F2> <@U7SL518D6>?",

I will look through the GitHub Repo for the CLI and see if there’s an undocumented arguement for this. Regardless I’ll get the documentation updated to point to the API limits."
