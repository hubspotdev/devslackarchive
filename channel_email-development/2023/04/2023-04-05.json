    "text": "Hello,\nI'm using the HubSpot Associations API in my custom code to retrieve the custom association type between a \"Deal\" object and a \"Contact\" object, for example \"occupant\", \"owner\" etc. However, I'm facing an issue where instead of returning the custom association type name, the API is simply returning \"deal to contact\".\nI believe this is because the API is not recognizing the custom association type that I have created. Can you please help me resolve this issue and retrieve the custom association type correctly?\n```      // Recherche contacts\n      // solution 1: ne retourne pas les types d'association\n      \n      HubSpot.crm.objects.associationsApi.getAll(toDeal, dealId, [\"contacts\"]).then(results =&gt; {\n          let associations = results.results;\n          let contact_ids = associations.map(a =&gt; a.id);\n          console.log('associations: ',associations, contact_ids);\n          contact_ids.forEach(function (entry) {\n            console.log(entry);\n          })\n      })```\n       Thank you",
