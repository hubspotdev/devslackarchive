With theme fields only users who explicitly have the permission for theme style settings would have the ability to set those options. In addition there is no content within the theme styles editor, so the user has no reason to think they should go there to update content.\n\nSome data you can actually just get from the HubSpot account itself. Your example of social accounts, we actually have a way for you to do that built directly into the platform. Open the default follow me module to see how you can create fully custom follow buttons for your site, that integrates directly with the HubSpot social settings. implementing it this way, the folks in charge of social can choose which accounts should be displayed and they are linked to the accounts directly connected to the HubSpot account."
