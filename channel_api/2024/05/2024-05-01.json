From our research it seems there is no API specific to Knowledge Base Articles.\n\nWe found some endpoints however they are very limited.\n\nFor article listing we used endpoint '/cms/v3/site-search/search?type=KNOWLEDGE_ARTICLE&amp;q=a_b_c_d_e_f_g_h_i_j_k_l_m_n_o_p_q_r_s_t_u_v_w_x_y_z' however since the articles are all private behind SSO it is not returning anything.\n\nFor Content fetching of a particular article we used endpoint '/cms/v3/site-search/indexed-data/{{contentID}}?type=KNOWLEDGE_ARTICLE' and it returned the data. However the content here, if there is a hyperlink, it is missing from our response. Even tables, they are not structured jsut the cell content shows in an array without any description or reference to columns or rows.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is there a way to list all knowledge base articles by API even if they are private behind SSO?\n- For the Article Content Fetch, is there a way to get the content in html format?\n- Is there an API to export knowledge base in csv but through API?",

It is available if you export the contact information directly from the contact record in HubSpot.",
