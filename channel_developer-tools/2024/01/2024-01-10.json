    "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI had a doubt regarding the external tracking and ad scripts used on a website with HubSpot cookie consent.\n\nSo HubSpot says if we are using external scripts then we need to use the cookie scanner (beta) to categorize them in order to block them accordingly in the future. My question is, is the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/events/cookie-banner#block-third-party-cookies-manually|cookie consent banner api> supposed to do the same thing without cookie scanner (beta)? Maybe it was later HubSpot released the cookie scanner to automate and get rid of the manual work? and one could of course choose between either of the options. Let me know if I'm wrong xD\n\nThank you in advance\n\n#cookieconsent <#CCQ7H31D5|developer-tools> #cookiescanner",
