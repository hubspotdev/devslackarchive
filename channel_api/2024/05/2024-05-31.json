Using enrollment criteria you can target exactly this!\n\nNow if you dont have accesses workflows you've got 2 options:\n• <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/webhooks|webhooks>\n    ◦ this will fire a post request to an established webhook endpoint, From there you can use the API to get the category property from the object sent to the webhook and fire the email needed\n• polling\n    ◦ you can also poll the deal's API checking for closed won deals that represent the sale"

The person who created the Private App in HubSpot is leaving the company an I'm wondering if I can transfer it vs recreating it (HubSpot's Private App scope seems tied to its creators permissions).
