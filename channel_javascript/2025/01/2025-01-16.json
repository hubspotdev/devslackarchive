    "text": "Hello javascript fellas,\n\nI built a custom theme/website for a client, and one of the modules displays different content based on the location of the visitor.\nIf I use smart rules, then the page does not fully pre-render. So I am using <https://geoiplookup.io/> to find the users location, and then manipulate the DOM accordingly.\n\nThis adds a delay to the rendering, since an additional request is made after the page renders to find the visitors IP.\nI looked for different ways to figure it out, and there is one thing that caught my eye. If I use a HubSpot form, with a phone field, the prefix country will always be populated by default. I don't understand how that is happening, but I think I can use that value and avoid having to make an additional request to geoiplookup.\n\nIn the screenshot, you'll see that Netherlands (or wherever the user is located) is selected by default, and I can use that value on other modules as needed.\nIf anyone has dealt with a similar issue in the past, I would be very happy to hear what approach you took!",
