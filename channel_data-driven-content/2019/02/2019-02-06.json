    "text": "A general question about Hubdb and it's potential: Right now we have one table that powers three different sections of the website. The table consists of speakers and it's like 200+ entries right now and will grow into 450ish by the end of year with duplicates (there are duplicates already in the db). The page load time (<http://datacoucil.ai/speakers|datacoucil.ai/speakers>) is also significantly grown as the page grows. My question is we're planning to split the table into atleast 3 or even 4 different tables so the backend would essentially become an RDBMS and is Hubdb a good solution for this. Is there a performance downside if we split this big table into multiple tables. Or should we switch to an actual RDBMS backend and use it to build the solution.",
