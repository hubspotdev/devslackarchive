    "text": "Hello everyone! I am developing blog listing page in HubSpot right now, is there a way to obtain certain category blog posts after category filter is clicked?\nAnd I don't mean by generating all the blog posts in HTML at first and then just filter them by Javascript - I think that more efficient option would be to \"tell HubSpot\" that I want to obtain certain blog posts that I need right now.\nIs there a way to pull these blog posts after button is clicked? Something like JS injection to HubL\nI recognize also that it would be possible with use of Blog API but it requires authentication method (unlike HUBDB when table becomes public)",
