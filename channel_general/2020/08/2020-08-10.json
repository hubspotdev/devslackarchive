    "text": "Hi guys,\nI have a client who is showing an event overview. I created a react app to show the overview but everything else is just HubSpot pages / modules. I put the events in HubDB. I have a column with capacity and a column with registrations to check the capacity for the events. My client wants a form for people to register to these events. Is there any way to update the column in HubDB when someone sends the form? It would be great if there is some workflow setup available to achieve this.\nI do not have the budget to create a simple script on a server to update the HubDB column using the HubDB API and Form API.",
