    "text": "Hello. I am blocked and would love some help please. I'm writing some hubl within a custom module. My goal is to access more (ideally all) of the values associated with the properties that I have stored in my custom data object ('CDO'). I'm using code like this to access a dictionary of property name and values for a specific custom data object: {% set thisCDO = crm_object(\"fullyQualifiedName\", id)%} then when I enter {{thisCDO}} I am returned a very short dictionary with type items {CDO_id = number, id = number}} I defined CDO_id as a primary display property when I set the object up - so perhaps that is why it is coming back. What I want help with is: How do I get a complete(or more complete) dictionary of properties and values returned. So, for example, I also defined a property called CDO_balance (a number field) that I would love to be able to return for the website viewer to see. Any ideas? Thanks Dave",

    "text": "Hey - I have solved this problem through some good old fashioned hacking.  Sharing the solution for anyone else who has the same issue.  I found that when I modified my code, as follows, it tailored the dictionary returned to me: {% set thisCDO = crm_object(\"fullyQualifiedName\", id,'id,cdo_id,cdo_balance')%}  when then typing {{thisCDO}} I was then returned with a dictionary with three properties, this time including cdo_balance.  Anyway, as I said, positing in case you've been banging your head against this brick wall also."
