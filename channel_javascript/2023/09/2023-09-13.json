    "text": "Technical problem: live chat not working on capacitor app\nHi, we use live chat in a React Capacitor app. It works perfectly on the web and our android native app but doesn't work on iOS native app. It might have something to do with the address <capacitor://localhost:3000> ??? I've edited the script to look like this:\n&lt;script\ntype=\"text/javascript\"\nid=\"hs-script-loader\"\nasync\ndefer\nsrc=\"<https://js.hs-scripts.com/20646833.js>\"\n&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\nso that the src uses https instead of capacitor, but it's still not showing up. The HubSpot tracking script seems to be loading, but it's not showing the messenger. It works perfectly with the intercom web chat, which I'm trying to migrate away from. Do you have any ideas as to why it's not working?\n\nI think it's because of the <capacitor://localhost> address because it works fine on capacitor for android which has an <HTTP://localhost> address. It is impossible to change capacitor to HTTP or https but I am able to change it to anything else, e.g., <HubSpot://localhost>\n\nAlso, I am using widget refresh API function as it is required for the android native app.\n\nAny workarounds?"
