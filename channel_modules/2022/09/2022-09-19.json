    "text": "Hi ! I've created a search bar module where i inject js and css in the module.html file. I'm having an issue where when I add the module to my page (drag &amp; drop to a website page), it initializes a search bar but it doesnt actually function (cant click, no redirect) due to conflicting css between the theme page and the search bar module.\n\nIs there a way to exclude a module from built-in page css? or what is the best solution because just remove the conflicting css enlarged the search bar to match the other page sections which wont work!\n\nThanks!",
