I can access the normal style field types directly in the styles group and in its immediate child groups, but not in its child’s child groups (gives me the normal, non-style field options, and I can’t even move style fields into the group)\nEDIT: Yeah, it is a bug, I assume? It functions as you would expect from outside the child group, but once you go into the child group, the field options change.",
