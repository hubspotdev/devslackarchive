    "text": "So this is only for modules that are created and have the rich text field in them. This configuration wouldnt apply to the default rich text module that is available for users or for rich text in the HubDB rich text column.\n\nThat being said, you can totally create a custom module called “(Company Name) Rich text” and then via local development, configure the fields you want to have in the WYSIWYG toolbar for it.\n\nLet me know if this helps answer your question Kris."
