This field is mapped to a Salesforce text field but notice some values that are being entered include alpha characters.\n\nI thought with the HubSpot validation property setting it would block alphanumeric characters but its not workingâ€¦ Any suggestions? Is there some customizations that could block these values.?\n\nThinking something that could be done on the field that could flash an error when a user tries to submit the wrong format.",
