We are using a workflow and it works the first time, but once they are enrolled in the workflow, it will not re-enroll them.  The opt in/out triggers are not allowed for re-enrollment. I'm playing with some other ideas like multiple workflows or modifying a custom contact property and using that to fire another workflow to un-enroll, but that seems janky and could create race conditions on whether we see all opt in/out actions. Any ideas?",
