It had a lot of pros like the direct way to associate and create deals, contacts and line_items. As is looks like to me, one request with the old endpoint is now 2 with the new ones.  First create a deal, get the contactId, and associate the contact with the deal. Is there any way to achieve direct associations at creation with the new endpoints or do I have to make extra association requests for every object? thx for any help :slightly_smiling_face:",

However, sometimes the \"Search Endpoint\" does not find an existing contact even though it exists with the given email address. In this case, we try to create the contact, but this results in an error because the contact already exists. We are using php :disappointed:  ... So since we cannot explain this error, it would be helpful if we received a notification from HubSpot when an endpoint, for example, throws a 400 error code. If this is at all possible."
