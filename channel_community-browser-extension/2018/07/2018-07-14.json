    "text": "The HubSpot Developer Extension v1.03 Beta has been released. <https://github.com/williamspiro/HubSpot-Developer-Extension/releases/tag/v1.03-beta-3>\n\nThis beta is to test a few new pieces of functionality that the extension has. The Dark Theme has several significant updates, there’s a new Dev Nav feature which adds a dev menu to the HubSpot nav bar. We also made the extension support Spanish. Possibly the biggest change that could cause issues(though I haven’t noticed any). We’ve overhauled the permissions required by the extension to make them as minimal as possible - improving security and making people feel better.\n\nInstructions for testing are in the ReadMe of the repo.\n\nIf you install the beta version please let us know if you run into any issues or have feedback! Thanks!"
