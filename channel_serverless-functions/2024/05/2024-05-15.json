Address the validation errors and try building again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your HubSpot plan doesn't include endpoint for app functions, so you can't use them to create app functions with endpoint. Remove the `endpoint` property from /app/app.functions/serverless.json. If you need access, talk to your admin about upgrading your plan.\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------\nDoes anyone knows is there any other option that should be enabled, or where the endpoint should be configured?\nOr maybe the documentation is bad, and client needs another addon like *Content Hub* or *Service Hub*",
