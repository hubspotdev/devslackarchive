    "text": "Not sure which channel to ask this in - in regards to recent property file type updates, I am experiencing the same issue as this poster in the community today <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/New-File-properties-are-broken-and-it-s-hurting-our-clients/m-p/956775>.\nIt seems recently file properties were changed or updated. This has broken live pages which were referencing these properties for image elements. Previously a string/url could be returned by this property and then used within an image element.\nNow, the file property returns only an id. Is there a plan to make this backwards compatible so that we can still pull the url out of the property? Right now this would require passing the ID to a HubSpot api to get the image url back which is a big change from being able to use the property directly in hubl.\nThis also is causing a weird issue within the crm records view of said properties, where previous urls are no longer accessible and when re-added the format updates etc..
