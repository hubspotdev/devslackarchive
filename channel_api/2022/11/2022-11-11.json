    "text": "Hi guys,\nWe are facing an issue randomly appearing in our HubSpot system that we have some contacts which accidentally have 1 more additional emails associated, assumably they are added by us calling a deprecated V1 endpoint of yours\n<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/batch_create_or_update>\n\nThis endpoint should create new contact as it stated in documentation\n“If an email address is used, and there is not an existing record with that email address, then a new contact record will be created.”\n\nBut instead it seems to update a random existing contact making it original primary email A as additional email, setting the new email B provided as a new primary one.\n\nWe started to iteratively move away from the V1 endpoint and use V3, which helped us discover this issue.\nDid anyone faced similar issue?",
