    "text": "Just getting started with the HubSpot API and hitting some authentication issues. I’m not trying to impersonate another user, just trying to use either my API Key or Private app access token to create some custom object schemas. I’m using the Node API.\n\nI’ve tried instantiating the client with both :\n\n`_const_ HubSpotClient = new HubSpot.Client({ apiKey: HubSpot_API_KEY })`\n`_const_ schema = await HubSpotClient.crm.schemas.coreApi.create({...})`\n\nThe error I’m getting is :\n\n```The scope needed for this API call isn't available for public use. If you have questions, contact support or post in our developer forum.```\nIs it possible to use a private app Api Token to create custom object schemas?\n\nWhen I try:\n`_const_ HubSpotClient = new HubSpot.Client({ accessToken: HubSpot_ACCESS_TOKEN })`\n`_const_ schema = await HubSpotClient.crm.schemas.coreApi.create({})`\n\nI get the following error:\n\n```Authentication credentials not found. This API supports both API Key and OAuth 2.0 authentication and you can find more details at <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/auth/oauth-overview>```\nSo it sounds like private apps can’t create custom object schemas, but I’m not sure how to use the appropriate scope with my account’s api key.\n\n:shrug:",
