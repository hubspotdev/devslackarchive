I have first name and the last name field and I do not want it to be able to receive URLs, just text.\nI know that I could do validation from a frontend but it is easy to change by a potential hacker, is it possible for a HubSpot to not receive it but throw an error?"

That said, I don't actually really need the data on the form, I primarily just need the email address to pass through as a way for HubSpot to create the contact record and/or more importantly pass on the attribution data.",
