    "text": "Hello, I have a really stupid issue. I'm pretty new to CLI and I wonder, how do I upload files? And yes, I follow the CLI guide, but when I use my Visual Studio Code, I keep getting [ERROR] `src` is a module path but `dest` is not. What do I do wrong with the destination? What should be included in it? I'm working in folder that is already authenticated, so I use something simple as /My_Theme/modules, which is copied path from  the design manager. Thank you for your help :slightly_smiling_face:",

Which I enter and it gives me the error."
