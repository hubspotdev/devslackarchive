    "text": "hi all. I am looking into creating a blog and HubDB filtering and pagination mechanism that when selecting a tag or filtering option, the content and URL updates, but the page does not reload.\n\nI know how to technically implement all this and know to compensate for server side rendering of the page for SEO.\n\nwhat I am \"struggling\" with right now is, unless I am missing something, HubSpot doesn't allow you to access blog or HubDB data via an API on the frontend. all the client libraries are server side code.\n\ni understand why, as to not expose the API secret from a Private App to the frontend, but is there another alternative solution? it seems odd that HubSpot doesn't allow any access to the backend data from the frontend, especially when making the calls from a HubSpot CMS page.\n\nam I missing something?",
