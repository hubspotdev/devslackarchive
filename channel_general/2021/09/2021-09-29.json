    "text": "Hi! Question: Is building a CMS site via the Design Manager still an viable option? Background: I am a designer proficient in front-end development (HTML, CSS, JS). A couple of years ago I built two client sites in HubSpot using the drag-and-drop template builder and custom CSS &amp; JS. A few things have changed since I last used HubSpot to build a website… (I see the recommended method now, is command line / local development tools). A large part of the appeal of HubSpot CMS to me was the ability to build a fully fledged CMS / CRM driven site in a low-code environment, without having to enlist the services of a back-end developer. A potential new client project is coming up, so my question is: is this low-code approach still possible or not? Thanks in advance!",

    "text": "I would also suggest leveraging a marketplace theme. This will give you a rough start that you can use the design manager to add custom modules to the existing theme. This way you can avoid the CLI and build from scratch. But if you want full control then you would need to use the CLI. The CLI isn't that daunting once you give it a try.
