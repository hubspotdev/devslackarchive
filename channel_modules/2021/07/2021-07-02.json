    "text": "I'm working in HubSpot CMS and have 2 modules in a drag and drop area in the global footer, each in it's own dnd row. The first is a simple rich text field, the second is a clone of the social-follow module that I have modified slightly. Everything works and displays perfectly in the editor, but in preview and when published the social module does not display at all. Even the wrapper code for that module (outside any logic) does not display. Anyone have any ideas?"
