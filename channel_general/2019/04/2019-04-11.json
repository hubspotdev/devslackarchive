Is this a caching issue? Does anyone know how to solve this? This was never an issue until we went live with the site yesterday. Thank you!",

As a test, I ran an incognito test, searched on google for an ad including “patch management” and filled out the form. This is the contact that was created: <https://app.HubSpot.com/contacts/wouldn't_you_like_to_know/contact/13277351/properties>\n\nIn the contact it has the LP I visited correct but labels my source as organic. During this test, we noticed that the UTM and gClid were not included in the URL and we’re worried the site is stripping these. We doubled checked our end for automated tagging in G-ads and that the UTM exists for the account. I also had Chris (the other one) test. Same issue. ”",
