If you have questions, contact support or post in our developer forum.'\n\nIt was my understanding that for Enterprise we are able to create custom objects through an app integration, this seems to say otherwise (which is a huge problem since this app is supposed to be an Enterprise custom object app). Does anyone have any insight on this?"
