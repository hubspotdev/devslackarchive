It’s synchronous and snappy.\n\nIf you’re curious about how it works and the developer experience - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgJ8oYo-M4Q&amp;t=2131s)~|watch this demo> we created with the HubSpot DevRel team, or <https://docs.sequin.io/|check out our docs>.\n\nWe want to continue to make this product great - and would love to hear any feedback or questions.",
