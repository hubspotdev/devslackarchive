Should we do these things:- *Step 1:* first check with some API if user already exist with email. *Step 2* : If not exist then create a contact and get contact ID . *Step 3:* Use contact ID to insert/update contact custom properties. *OR* there is a single API to insert or update contact with custom properties? One doubt I have if I would have to user search API for finding contact with email there may be a API request limit of 4 request per second as per this URL <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/search>",
