    "text": "We had an instance where we were trying to use a HubSpot form inside of a modal, but we had to conditionally load the form, so only people using -smartcontent- who were not part of a specific list would see the form. People who were on the list would instead see a button to download a resource. We wanted to retain the ability for our marketers to be able to directly edit the form, so the form code itself could not be within the smart content area or else they would lose the ability to edit.\n\nAnyways we found a work around to the problem. Though it would still be good to know how to display a form that has been exported to template context. For all the other hubl supported modules you can display them after exporting to template context, so there should be a way to do it with forms as well. It'd be fine if we had to just pull the id of the form then pop that into the javascript embed code."
