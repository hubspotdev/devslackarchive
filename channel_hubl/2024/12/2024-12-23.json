    "text": "I'm having an issue using `blog_recent_posts`. For some reason it's returning an empty array `[]` although it had previously been working, and I don't understand why it isn't now.\n\nThe code is this:\n```{% set number_of_posts = 4 %}\n{% set blog_id = 4114464473 %}\n{% set all_blogs = blog_recent_posts(blog_id, number_of_posts) %}\nBlog data: {{ all_blogs }}```\nAnd this just gives back:\n```Blog data: []```\nThe blog id appears to be correct, and I've also tried using `\"default\"` which returns the same.\nWhat's additionally odd is that the `blog_recent_tag_posts` function does return posts when using the same `blog_id` and specifying a category tag like this:\n```{% set all_blogs = blog_recent_tag_posts(blog_id, 'finance', number_of_posts) %}```\nI'd like it to just give back all blogs regardless of tagging...\n\nI'm new to HubSpot am I misunderstanding how this works?"
