We changed the CTA style from the button preset to “Link (No Style)” so it’s only the link.\nFrom there, we copied and pasted button CSS from this tool to have it apply as needed to our site: <https://www.clickminded.com/button-generator/>\nTo add the hover effect, we added:\n.&lt;CSS-Custom Class-Name&gt;:hover {\n  background-color: #C2571D !important;\n}"
