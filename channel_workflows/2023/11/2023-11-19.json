I'd like to have some confirmation.\n\n#1 if I add a contact to another workflow, via a workflow, does that contact bypass the enrollment trigger?\n\n#2 if I add a contact to workflow that is based on calendar date delays does it bypass or go through steps with dates in the past?\neg. if there is a webinar email drip campaign via a workflow, a new person entering a workflow wouldn't get the earlier emails where the date already passed, right?\n(today is let's say Dec 1, the workflow was sending out emails on Nov 15, nov 22 and then will on dec 2 would the contact get the dec 2 email but not the earlier ones?)",
