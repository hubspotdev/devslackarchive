I wasn't able to find in the documentation - is it better to edit directly in one of the HubSpot themes (Vast, Clarity, etc) or to copy a theme to edit?  or is there a \"child theme\" capability in order to style but receive updates that may be later released?"

Then if you feel you prefer direct coding you can start building coded templates. I wouldn’t start with those however if you are new."
