My thought was that I could potentially pass through email address to confirmation page via query string and then do a get contact API request to pull in values but that seems like overkill. I was hoping for something more native to HubSpot. The use case is that the form is step 1 of a multi-step application process and need to take them to an external pre-filled page."

The flow when you have a page redirect would be\n\nsave form submissions/submit, redirect to page, send specific query string with user data &amp; something like `&amp;firstpass=true`\n\nOn redirect page you see firstpass=true, then timeout for 1500ms, then redirect to the same page with the page data  (removing the firstpass=true so you don’t redirect cycle) and a random string appended (this helps ensure page cache is cleared) like `&amp;refresh=lkwj23rln2lknre2bhl3kh452h32b`\n\nthen the page will have all data."
