B2B Enrichment integration (Clearbit, Apollo etc) \n3. Junk submissions \n4. Real-time personalisation / Writing great copies for the form \n5. Engineering Integration of tools like Email Verification, Calendar Scheduling etc \nWould love to learn if any of these are burning painpoints for you, or if thereâ€™s something that that you really about during the lead capture process."
