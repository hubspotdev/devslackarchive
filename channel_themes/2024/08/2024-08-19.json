    "text": "Hello everyone! I am working on developing a customer portal.  I am curious whether it is possible to develop custom theme templates for pages like ticket listing, and ticket details? It seems to me like yes, that we can use pre-built modules from HubSpot. However, I have noticed that some CSS is not applying. Could you help me with the correct importing of customer portal modules? Also, could you explain how to change these templates to the one that I will create?"
