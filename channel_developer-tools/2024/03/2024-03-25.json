If I don't assign it to the h6, it's not available.  How is HubSpot setting this up?  I don't want to have to assign it to anything in order to use the font.  And I don't think I need to import the font if HubSpot somehow knows it when I assign it to the h6.  I hope this makes sense :slightly_smiling_face:   Thank you!",
