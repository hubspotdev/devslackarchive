Deals have a `stage` and a `pipeline`, but the `deal_stage` is not one-to-one with the `dealpipeline_stagelabel` (the `deal_pipeline` does seem to match the `dealpipeline_label`).\n\nAm I missing something or should the `stageid` really be added to the `deals` in the API?",

I’m also looking to upload assets via the API to have as the default assets to be used by that template, though ultimately want them to be editable via the CMS. should those assets go into the File Manager or into the Design Tools, and thus use the appropriate API for that? are there benefits to serving assets from one vs the other?"
