    "text": "Hey <@U05AG9W9FN1>  You were super helpful when I was working on setting up a custom object.  Now I'm trying to access data from the company object that's associated with my custom object.  Is there a hubl function to pull this data or do I need to use the API?  I have tried using crm_associations, but I'm afraid I'm not sure what to use for all of the fields.  Is the ID the  hs_object_id that's returned from the crm_objects function?  And do I have to use Postman to access the type id?  Thanks!"
