    "text": "Was there a solution found for this? I’m trying to update a custom property on a custom object every time an associated deal changes, but the trigger doesn't re-enroll the custom object into the workflow. The triggers that enroll it are not able to re-enroll it. It would work better to base the workflow on the deal instead, but the associations api isn’t letting me see custom objects associated with a given deal. It says it can't infer the type of my custom object. I can only find deals associated with custom objects (not the other way around). That means, when running the custom code from the deal, i can’t find the id of the associated custom object that i need to update. Has anyone ever run into this before?"
