When I use it, the search bar displays below the quick filter properties but in the sample project screenshots its above the quick filter properties. Attaching screenshots for reference... anything I can be doing here to have my table look like the one in the sample project or is the screenshot simply not reflective of what the CrmAssociationTable actually looks like in use?",
