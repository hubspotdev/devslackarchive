    "text": "hey <@U073LH14BJQ>. I think this may solve your problem. I append a css file to the form iframe, something like this (you may need to change the logic/IDs/names slightly as this is an old example)\n\n```onFormReady: function($form) {\n      const iframe = document.getElementById(\"hs-form-iframe-0\");\n      const innerdoc = iframe.contentDocument || iframe.contentWindow.document;\n      let otherhead = innerdoc.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0];\n      var css = document.createElement(\"link\");\n      css.type = \"text/css\";\n      css.rel = \"stylesheet\";\n      css.href = \"{{ get_asset_url('theme-name/css/embeded-form-styles.css') }}\";\n      otherhead.appendChild(css);\n    }```"

    "text": "Hi all. I wondered if we have any control over the scripts that are loaded via the JS snippet. Our marketing team uses HubSpot for analytics on our sites, (tracking clicks, and where users came from, ads etc) and we're _also_ using the snippet within our own application for user-based analytics (page views etc). We don't however do any pixel tracking or interactive stuff with the HubSpot SDK and so we don't want that code running in our application.\nRight now our CSP blocks these requests. We only allow:\n```script-src\n  *.<http://hs-scripts.com|hs-scripts.com>\n  *.<http://hs-banner.com|hs-banner.com> \n  *.<http://hscollectedforms.net|hscollectedforms.net> \n  *.<http://hs-analytics.net|hs-analytics.net>```\nAnd we're seeing script loading violations to:\n```<https://js.hsadspixel.net/fb.js>\n<https://js.HubSpot.com/web-interactives-embed.js>```\nBecause we don't want anything to do with ads/facebook or interactives running in our application.\n\nIs there a way to:\n1. Globally disable those extra scripts from being loaded by HubSpot?\n2. Specifically disable those extra scripts from being loaded in our web application (preferable)",
