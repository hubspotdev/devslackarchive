    "text": "Hey all!  I've been able to build a module to list all the contacts  owned by the registered contact (linked to a 'fake' user) in the membership module.  Is there a way to create a download button to pull some of the contacts uploaded files?  I've tried     &lt;a href=\"<https://api.HubSpot.com/form-integrations/v1/uploaded-files/signed-url-redirect/xxxxx?portalId=xxxxxxTest-Document.pdf>\" download&gt; Hardcoded link &lt;/a&gt;\nBut I think CORs is blocking me....any other suggestions for downloading contacts files from a membership webpage/portal?\nThanks!"
