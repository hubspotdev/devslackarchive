    "text": "Hey! I’m looking for some help with a phone number formatting issue for HubSpot SMS. Our SMS tool requires phone numbers to have a country code (e.g., `+1` for U.S.), but many of our contacts' numbers are missing this. We want to automate adding the country code using a custom-coded workflow action.\nDoes anyone have a sample code snippet or example workflow that handles adding country codes to phone numbers if they are missing? Ideally, the code should:\n• Detect if a number lacks a country code.\n• Automatically add `+1` for 10-digit U.S. numbers.\n• Leave numbers with existing country codes unchanged.\nI’d appreciate any guidance, code examples, or advice on best practices for this! Thanks in advance for your help! :blush:",
