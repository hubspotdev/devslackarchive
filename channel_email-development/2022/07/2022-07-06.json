    "text": "I would disagree a little. Newsletter style (though depends on what your definition of this is) is definitely possible with Gmail. Of course not crazy long because eventually you will hit the 102kb limit but that limit is due to the amount of code.\n\nThe drag and drop editor adds a LOT of unnecessary code bloat, this is the same for many other platform’s editors as well. And something like 2 columns is going to add even more code.\n\nWe would sometimes run in this issue with the drag and drop editor for one of our weekly emails (HubSpot’s little pop up about it would appear), but once I custom coded a template, where I have complete control over the code output, it's never been an issue."
