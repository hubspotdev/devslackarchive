    "text": "Hey, I've noticed that the HubSpot form module seems to have alignment issue with the fields whenever there are multiple columns (notice how each row doesn't always span a full 100% width).\n\nIt feels somewhat cumbersome to manually fix the alignment with new CSS (for desktop and mobile) every time a new form is used. At first I thought it might be my custom theme/css that is conflicting with the inherent HubSpot css for their form module, but even when I do a test with their <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate|standard boilerplate> template it's still messed up.\n\nAny ideas on how to fix this once and for all?",
