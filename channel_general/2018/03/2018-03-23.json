We have a parent company with multiple subsidiaries, but the parent company is not customer-facing, so each child company has their own site to avoid unnecessary confusion. Then they just have business rules on the sales side to make sure their CRMs are relatively in alignment, but even that could probably be automated.\n\nOn the other hand, if the parent was customer-facing and the child company seems more like a branch of the major brand, it would probably be more suited to a single enterprise situation with subdomains."
