    "text": "Hello Developer Community!\n\n<@U2H3TT8F2>, <@UD53A9UUR>, and yours truly have gone and created a podcast! We just wrapped up shooting episode 4, but I wanted to wait till I had a version of the website up before fully shouting it out to the community. Well, that time has come...  introducing... wait for it... <https://www.devsafterdarkpod.com/> !\n\n*Developers:After Dark* is a conversation about technology, coding, and overall development. We tie that in with careers, life journeys, and hobbies. Our latest episode (<https://youtu.be/9JNYUZQxVr4?si=9Tnl3X7RM8D5iGBz|watch here>) was with the community's own <@UFL9XN2DQ>.  We aim to have weekly guests (when scheduling permits) to bring you content where ever you consume it.\n\nYou can find us: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTGNq2fWP3b3HI_5R2Rz8vYgc3ADj0cqU|YouTube>, <https://open.spotify.com/show/6T5R6jd29VTBxwnioNzzP3|Spotify>, and <https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/developers-after-dark/id1773163486|Apple>!",
