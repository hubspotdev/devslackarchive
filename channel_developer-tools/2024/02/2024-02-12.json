    "text": "I meant that I set the video height on mobile to be 2000 px. The video is meant to be full screen 1920 x 1080 to fit the mobile screen, with the 'our partners' section underneath, but the lower third or so of the video is getting cut off.\n\nWhen you open the webpage on a desktop, the video is full screen and then you scroll down to see the rest of the page. I wanted the same effect for the mobile view."
