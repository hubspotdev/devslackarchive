    "text": "Hi, we are using HS CMS to host our website. We plan to deploy HS 1st party cookie and like to track visitors' activity on the website, Hope someone can help clarify some questions:\n1. Is there a way to identify a visitor as a Contact in HS by building some login status on the website?\n2. If 1 is possible, how to collect the data captured by the cookie and save the data to the HS Contact record?\n3. If a visitor is brand new, no Contact matching, can we add an anonymous Contact with some unique identifier? If this is possible, is there a way to match an anonymous Contact record with a known Contact record after, say, the person logs in? \n"
