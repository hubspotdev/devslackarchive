    "text": "Hi dear HubSpot Developer community!\n\nFor a client, I'm trying to setup a custom quote template. I cloned the HubSpot cms-quote-theme and made my own version of the cms template modern.html (I added a rich text module and pagebreak at the bottom of the quote to add terms &amp; conditions).\n\nI am struggling with the font color of the header section above. I want to change the blue background to something lighter, and thus for readability I need to make the font black. However, it seems this cannot be set in the global fonts in the theme editor.\n\nAny idea how I can modify the font color? I've looked through the stylesheet associated with the template (modern.css) but did not immediately find the solution. Thanks a million in advance.",
