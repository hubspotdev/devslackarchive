    "text": "Now that we have the ability to create App Card UI Extensions combined with the ability to create multiple team views and add those cards to specific team views, I believe it's time to ask for some user permission changes.  Specifically, we want users who wear multiple \"hats\" in our organization to be able to change their main team they want to work with whenever they want.  This is necessary because only main team members can see a team view where we add App Cards to help them do their job easier.  This is the power of App Cards in my view but this is currently limited because you can only see your main team view where the cards are located.  And since many or our users are on multiple teams that need to view the team view and access these cards, they need the ability to switch their main team anytime they want without asking an admin to do that for them.  Currently this is only possible for either a Super Admin or someone that has that specific user permission.  This makes sense for wanting only management to control teams and members.  I only want a user to be able to change \"their own main team\" and only to teams they are already a member of - then leave the rest of the general team management to the Super Admin.  This way those people can work this morning as one role and this afternoon as another more efficiently.  Who else thinks this is a good idea?",
