    "text": "Hi <@U6W3H6YN8>. I finally gave up VSC. I prefer my Pycharm. I've searched to write a HubSpot plugin for Intelleji platform (webstorm, phpstorm, pycharm, etc.). But it's in Java (<https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/custom_language_support_tutorial.html>). But I can code without such a plugin for now. So, the error is still present, but it's not really neither an issue: files are at least uploaded. So it's just a little feedback. And if you know someone fluent in Java, give to webstom, phpstorm, and pycharm users a HubSpot support would be very cool. :slightly_smiling_face:"
