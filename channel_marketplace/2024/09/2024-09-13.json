    "text": "Have anyone experienced this permission issue? A user is experiencing difficulty installing our app (which is not available yet in the marketplace, as we need more installs). The superadmin has given the user all the permissions required by the app. But still, the user can’t use the app. However, the superadmin is able to install it and use it, and in the past another user was able to also use it.\n\nMy guess is that this happens because the app is not in the marketplace yet. However, I haven’t found any limitation about this in the documentation.\n\nI’m seeking a potential solution to this issue. Thank you in advance!!",
