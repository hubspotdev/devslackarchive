We also have some niceties built into it where through prompts you select a portal from your HubSpot.config.yml, source/dest folders, and a preview url that auto-opens and LiveReloads with changes.  However, now that we’re using React for pretty much everything, we might go all in on webpack since we’re not really doing anything to the .module files anymore besides moving them."

We use Rollup to bundle a js library of all the React components. And this whole process is automated with Bamboo, which publishes an NPM package that we import into our Gulp build, as well as a documentation site that is used by our designers, developers, copywriters, etc."
