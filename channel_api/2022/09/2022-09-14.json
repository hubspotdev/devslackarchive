    "text": "Hi <#C2YHAHB6K|api>, I'm a developer at DxFactor, currently I'm working on integrating the HubSpot with our database, which will allow to sync contacts from HubSpot to the database. So far, using HubSpot's API, I could able to fetch all the recently created/modified contacts as per lastmodifiedate property, however it fails to fetch contacts which are deleted and moved to archieved. I needed to fetch those archieved contacts as well  to delete them in my database. I have also tried this api: <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts?archived=true> , but it fetches all the archieved contacts at a time, which I don't want. My requirement is to fetch archieved contacts according the lastmodifed/archieved date or essentially want to filter out data but doesnt want all the archieved contacts. I would really appreciate any solutions/ workaround. Thank you in advance !!",
