We’ve just been notified that they are missing the hutk cookie information and a lot of the referral info from the user.\n\nWe are wondering the best way to unify the anonymous users browsing behavior before signing up for our app, with the contact we create via the API.\n\nCan this be used to help tie the anonymous user with the record we created once the user signed up for our software?\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/api/conversations/visitor-identification>\n\nI see there are recommendations to use HubSpot Forms and others that say I should use the javascript library with the identify command.\n\nThe flow is as follows\n1. Visitor lands on our site\n2. At some point they signup for app (but we cannot use HubSpot Forms due to password TOS)\n3. We then create the contact on the backend using the API\n\nThis makes marketing miss critical visitor entrance and browsing behavior.\n\nIdeally we’d like to avoid having to use the Forms API if there is another way to connect this data to the contact we create.\n\nThis would probably be easier to do in a chat or call so let me know if that’s possible.",
