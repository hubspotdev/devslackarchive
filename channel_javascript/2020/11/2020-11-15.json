    "text": "<@U01EDM4EJJY> I don’t think this is due to the ES6 syntax. `myFunction = () =&gt; {...}` is adding `myFunction` to the `window`  object. I suspect changing it to `const = myFunction = () =&gt; {...}` would have the same result as your first attempt.\n\nI’m guessing this is due to minification. Eg `myFunction` gets transformed to something like `x` so your reference in the `onclick` handler will be referring to a function that doesn’t exist, hence “undefined”.\n\nI’d suggest avoiding using the `onclick`  handler and instead use an `eventListener` eg\n```const yourElement = document.querySelector('some_selector');\nyourElement.addEventListener('click', myFunction);```\nAlso, it’d be better to use a button for handling such behaviour"

    "text": "I guess a general rule should be that `a` tags should be reserved for navigation, whether that’s changing the page, scrolling to a different position or whatever. A `button` should be used for triggering actions, submitting forms etc. So unless your function is performing navigation, a `button` would be the more semantic choice"
