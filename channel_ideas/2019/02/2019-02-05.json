I'm working on an Idea ticket for this but want to see if there is already some initial interest\n\n[edit] For those who are interested, here is the link to the idea: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Include-Membership-Content-tool-as-an-Add-on/idi-p/250788>\n\nWould love an upvote if you find it helpful and let's see if we can get this added!",
