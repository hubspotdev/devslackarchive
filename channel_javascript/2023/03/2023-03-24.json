    "text": "Hello! I’m migrating from an API key to a private app on a repository that was started using the CMS boilerplate a few years back.\n\nThis is what the configs currently look like ( with Api key):\n```const apiKey = process.env.HubSpot_API_KEY;\n\nconst portalConfig = {\n  name: 'PROD',\n  useRawAssets: true,\n  portalId,\n  apiKey,\n};\n\nconst config = {\n  defaultPortal: 'PROD',\n  portals: [portalConfig],\n};```\nAnd this is what I tried changing them to:\n\n```const accessToken = process.env.HubSpot_ACCESS_TOKEN_PROD;\n\nconst portalConfig = {\n  name: 'PROD',\n  useRawAssets: true,\n  portalId,\n  accessToken\n};\n\nconst config = {\n  defaultPortal: 'PROD',\n  portals: [portalConfig]\n};```\nDoes anyone know if there are any other config options I need to pass in?\nI’m getting a failure when I try to push changes saying:\n`The portalId XXXXXX is missing authentication configuration`\n\nDo I need to setup an `authType` property to the configs? What would that type be?\nAny help is appreciated!",
