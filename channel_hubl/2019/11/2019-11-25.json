    "text": "Hello! Was looking into something someone brought up on the community forums about HubSpot Memberships and came to the same conclusion as them -- {{ request_contact.is_logged_in }} doesn't seem to work across subdomains.\n\n\n• I'm logged in on the main domain\n• {{ request_contact.is_logged_in }} comes up true on the main domain\n• {{ request_contact.list_memberships }} works fine on the subdomain and even shows that I'm in the list being used for HubSpot Memberships \n• and yet on the subdomain {{ request_contact.is_logged_in }} comes up false \n\nI can work around this by just checking the user against the list, but seems weird for this variable not to be working on subdomains?",
