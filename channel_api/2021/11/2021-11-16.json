This is necessary since ios 14.5. The Facebook pixel is not enough anymore since most IOs won't opt-in to cookies and tracking.\n\nThe problem is that, in HubSpot, Pageviews and CTA click are also tracked with cookies on the front-end and we don't have access to the server of our websites for server-side tracking...\n\n<@UD53A9UUR> <@U7SL518D6> <@U2H3TT8F2> I would appreciate your thoughts on this one.",
