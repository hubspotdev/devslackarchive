    "text": "Please make global modules editable without going into the design manager. When global modules were removed from the content settings area nothing was ever done to fix the hole that created, it has been an annoying problem ever since. Anytime they want one changed I end up having to change it because the interface right now is confusing for that.\n\nMarketing people don’t tend to go into the design manager much it looks scary to them, it looks very developery, and you know what, that’s okay, but that means you need to give them an interface to be able to edit global modules. Global Modules mostly get edited for content and marketing purposes, due to the new custom modules us developers don’t use global modules as much for doing more developer oriented site wide changes.\n\nMy suggestion - add an interface to edit a global module in the page editor, just add dialogs stating that editing the content there will affect ALL instances of the global module on every page. \n\nIt would also be great if we had a way to create global modules again. Right now global modules are like a hidden feature of HubSpot, the only way to create one is to add a module to a template, then right click/click the gear and convert to global module. This has resulted in us creating dummy templates just so we can drop these modules in and create global modules, while this works it’s an annoying problem.\n\nYou used to be able to straight up create one. That’s no longer possible. The trick above is the only way now.\n\n<@U8THBCFC4>\n\nPlease make a push to fix the broken Global Module situation. We’d appreciate it and so would the marketers.",
