    "text": "Hi all.\n\nI am currently developing an app that I want to list on HubSpot marketplace.\n\nI am in the phase to create a settings page for the App (1552654) and have one question regarding this. I am trying to set up the Account Component (<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/create-an-app-settings-page#set-up-the-account-component>) and I am using the provided example url <http://api-eu1.hubapi.com/application/settings/test/v1/actions/accounts-fetch|api-eu1.hubapi.com/application/settings/test/v1/actions/accounts-fetch>. But I only get the test accounts called John Doe etc.\n\nSo what do I do now? Is this something that can be skipped? Should I develop something else? Then how?"
