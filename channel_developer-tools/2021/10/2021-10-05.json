    "text": "If you're using browser based lazy loading it doesnt work based on rows. Its based on a distance amount from the viewport determined on the fly by the browser based on several factors. You should never see a lazy loaded image \"load\" within the viewport. The browser should load the image before you scroll it into view.\n\nYou can see the effect of lazy loading by opening the network tab in dev tools.\n\nMore info at: <https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/|https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/>"
