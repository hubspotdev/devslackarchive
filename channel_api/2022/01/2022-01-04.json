    "text": "Hi Francis! Nice to see HubSpot improving this feature!\n\nI’m not a developer, but used the Calling feature a few times and I tried to create a product connecting the HubSpot Calling Extensions SDK and another calling service for my company-only use (probably using Twilio).\nMy biggest challenge was that this extension just provide support for paid users (independently if my HubSpot portal is Enterprise or not). So we would need to pay a HubSpot user license and the third-party calling service just to use that.\n\nIn the end, we chose to use an external platform without any connection to CRM."

    "text": "Thanks for the feedback Felipe.\nIf that barrier were removed, at a high level how would the integration have functioned?\n• Would you imagine reps making calls from HubSpot directly\n• Would they continue to use the 3rd party software but have the data sync with the CRM?"

    "text": "They should make calls from HubSpot directly, absolutely!\n\nJust a few specific cases would still use a 3rd party software, like my Collection team that needs to make bulk calls via an automatic dialer. But this is a specific case and even for them we should at least sync the data with the CRM"
