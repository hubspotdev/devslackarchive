I can see the version that you uploaded on the 14th that had lowercase + dashes in it.\n\n\n*Have you tried uploading it as a new listing?*\n(I’m just guessing that the label was changed after the listing was created,.There’s a chance maybe we’re not detecting that change.)"

Is there any way to sort of ‘force refresh’ HubSpot reading the label change? I don’t think we ran into this issue when we submitted our previous theme, which is strange"
