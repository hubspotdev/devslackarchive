I'm not sure if we are adding the code the correct way to make the logo dark mode friendly. Here's how I have it set up (attached - the code shown is how it appears in the \"additional &lt;head&gt; markup\" ), but it isn't working and nothing is showing up in the HTML of a test email either. Any suggestions? Perhaps creating a fully customized template is the way to go. I'll also search this feed in the case this has been answered already.",
