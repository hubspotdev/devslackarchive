    "text": "Hey everyone, thought I post this quite basic question here, as I'm new to HubSpot website building. A problem I've encountered quite a lot is the inability to apply classes and id's to elements from within the page builder.  If there's a certain type of section on every page that I want to target with css, I have to target their unique class / id separately. Is there a way to add classes and id's as fields in the page builder or otherwise approach this problem in a better way?",
