The Personalization token markup generated would need to be edited in the source cause `\"\"` inside of the `href=\" \"` attribute is incorrect markup.\nincorrect: `&lt;a href=\"{{ personalization_token(\"contact.webinar_link\", \"\") }}\"&gt;Some Link&lt;/a&gt;`\ncorrect: `&lt;a href=\"{{ personalization_token('contact.webinar_link', '') }}\"&gt;Some Link&lt;/a&gt;`\n2. However, while editing in the WYSIWYG view, if someone clicks that link and the Personalization token is written out as the \"correct\" form above, the URL field gets prepended with a temporary url such as: `https://&lt;email_domain&gt;/-temporary-slug-&lt;some_generated_number&gt;`\nThis could cause some large issue with clients if an editor doesn't notice that change had occurred.\n3. After doing some more testing, it looks like just using the basic Hubl markup for a contact property does not cause this and still populates correctly (as long as the contact property is filled out):\nexample: `&lt;a href=\"{{ contact.webinar_link }}\"&gt;Some Link&lt;/a&gt;`\n\nHopefully this is helpful for those of us that deal with emails and dynamic properties like this."
