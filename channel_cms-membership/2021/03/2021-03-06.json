As yet, we haven't been able to find a way to do this.\n\nWe've been trying to create a process of:\n1. User fills in form and is added to appropriate list\n2. A loading spinner appears while we grab the `registrationCode` from the API\n3. The page gets confirmation that we've received the `registrationCode` and loads the password creation template\n4. User creates password\n5. User is logged in and lives happily ever after\nThe issue is around step two. We can't find any way to capture the `registrationCode` except by actually being the person receiving the email.\n\nHas anyone else built a solution for this?"
