It seems like you would be better off using <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/marketing/transactional-emails|SMTP API or single-send API> if you need to add external data to the email. For other use cases I think emails and workflows directly in HubSpot offer a lot of flexibility - let me know if you ever need help with those"
