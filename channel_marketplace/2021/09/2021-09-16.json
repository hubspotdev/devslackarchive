How is it counted? I've installed my app from developer account on few HubSpot instances (3 are HubSpot Production and 2 are test accounts) but I see \"1 total installs\" in the Listing details tab. Does anyone know what cause the problem? It's app for integration.",

    "text": "Hi <@U02FA8KJABS>,\n\nThe app requires to get installed at least 3 different HubSpot accounts. The registered mail id of each HubSpot account should be different and probably be hosted on a company domain (not a Gmail, etc.).\n\nFor example, If you connect 3 different HubSpot accounts registered with the same mail ID, it may count as 1.\n\nTo verify app installation, please visit section Settings -&gt; Integrations -&gt; Connected Apps in each connected HubSpot account. Your app should be listed here if installed in that particular HubSpot account. Thank you :slightly_smiling_face:"

What's the reason on that requirement and how we should get the installations when the app is not listed on the marketplace. It just doesn't make sense to me."
