If not, could you please tell me what are *all* the possible properties to query from the API please?\nI'm specifically looking for the data point `manual forecast amount`, is it possible to extract this one? We'd like to have all the manual input of our representatives in our DBs and keep a record of it as well.\nLast time I checked it wasn't possible to extract them.
