    "text": "Hi everybody. I've got a very strange error (a React error; I don't use React - nobody is perfect :wink:). This one:\n```v2.js:formatted:7431 Uncaught Error: Minified exception occurred; use the non-minified dev environment for the full error message and additional helpful warnings.\n    at i (v2.js:formatted:7431)\n    at Object.a [as getID] (v2.js:formatted:4498)\n    at Object.isRenderedByReact (v2.js:formatted:4666)\n    at Object.getFirstReactDOM (v2.js:formatted:4671)\n    at a (v2.js:formatted:4127)\n    at i.perform (v2.js:formatted:6773)\n    at Object.batchedUpdates (v2.js:formatted:3667)\n    at Object.a [as batchedUpdates] (v2.js:formatted:5626)\n    at dispatchEvent (v2.js:formatted:4185)```\nIt appears on a DOM element when I click on it but this element doesn't have any event listener on it, and I have the same code on another page where I don't have this error (I reuse the same code and the same forms). If I could see the real error it will be great. I think there is a problem with my code on the HubSpot react app, but I cannot read the real error... I could give more informations if you want it. Thanks."
