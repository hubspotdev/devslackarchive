    "text": "Hi! I'm really new to HubSpot since I just started to work with it this week, but I already got a huge assignment: to build up a test environment for a client. The client has a vast website with some integrations and the idea was to make a sandbox out of it for testing purposes. Basically to test integrations before production launch. Everything is new to me but I'm starting to realise that the task is impossible. Could someone ensure me that the sandbox sync does and will not sync webpage content? And that there is now way of doing it. Or have I understood something wrong or not found some resource?"
