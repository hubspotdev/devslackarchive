What are the rules for the creation of a net new section when a module is being drug into the page editor?\n\nThe reason for asking is that it was assumed that each full width element would be a new \"section\" versus being lumped into a higher level section -- it is causing some confusion within the page editor.  cc <@UA886MF42> (I think you might be the one to help clear this up?)",

When you drag and drop a new module in into a “top level row” position in the editor, we’ll create a new section, a column inside that section, a row inside of that, and then put the module inside of that. (Though we don’t show the row toolbar unless the row has more than one column, or it already had some styling on it)."
