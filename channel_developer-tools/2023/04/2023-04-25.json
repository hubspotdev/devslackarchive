    "text": "Hi, I have a question with regards to reCaptcha and bot related spam-prevention: Apparently, HubSpot does not offer a really good instance to prevent bots from submitting forms. We have seen an increase in bot submissions which is obviously not what anyone wants. I read that there might be few workarounds, including creating a property field for the form where a user needs to do a simple match calculation. Another way would be using code (which is not really an option for us) and thirdly, to create a hidden field with a specific logic. This field would then only be visible for bots and not humans and once filled out by a bot, the logic would prevent the form from being submitted. If anyone knows how to create the third option, that would be immensely appreciated :)"
