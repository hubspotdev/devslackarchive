    "text": "Hey all. Every now and then I find myself thinking about HubSpot's image optimisation and what it does and doesn't do. In the below video (~1 year old), Kevin, who surely knows his stuff, recommends using smart rules to serve optimised images to mobile users to improve site speed. But shouldn't HubSpot's built in image optimisation do that automatically - optimising performance as long as the original image is compressed and sized appropriately? And wouldn't adding a smart rule to do this negatively impact page load speed by bypassing the edge-cached version?\n<https://youtu.be/uNDkycrG6og?si=PH2mdah0hH0BNzK5&amp;t=187>",

    "text": "Activity Associations:\nMight be really simple, does anyone know how to change the default associations on activities such as notes, calls logged etc?\nPreviously it just associates to the object the activity is on, but it has now defaulted to the object + any associated contacts, companies, deals... and so on. It can be unticked individually but this isn't really a good fix. Pending an absolute meltdown here on a database with over 30k contacts + a similar number of deals, companies etc... :melting_face:\n\nEdited to add: I have submitted a support ticket with HS directly, as live chat unavailable. Hoping it's just a simple setting somewhere I cannot find - the main issue is on deals as previously notes and calls were logged on a deal only, and we do not want them logged on associated company (we have companies with hundreds/thousands of deals associated to them)."
