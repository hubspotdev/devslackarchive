If you’re using dynamic pages the results are spread across multiple tables.\n\nFor example if you have 10 results per page worst case scenario you need to make 10 additional requests to fetch the table name/detail..\n\nThis could also be solved with a hubdb_tables() function which would allow me to create a javascript object with mappings."
