In VSCode, I have two portals connected: DEV, where I run `hs watch` in order to have a preview of the code I working on, and PROD that receive the code through Git Action when I push something from DEV in the Git Repo.\nWhat happens is that when I do any changes in the VS’code, the DEV portal magically disappears from HubSpot.config.yml :man-shrugging:\nDoes someone has a solution or some suggestion?"
