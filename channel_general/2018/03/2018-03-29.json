    "text": "Marco - I realized this is happening when a user puts the form into two columns, it brings in all the default HubSpot styling.  I'm not sure if the new form manager allows for creating a form and unchecking the \"remove HubSpot styling\" anymore or if that is only accessible in embed options -- but we were able to do this before. So in our forms that did have the default styling removed, if you add a two column to it, you need HubSpot styling."

    "text": "<@U7SL518D6> helped me to find the root of this issue. I am working on to resolve it. The issue is that when you update a resource, we serve the new resource as `raw-resource`, and same time, we start to minify it. If you reload the page before the minification finished, you get the `raw-resource`. Unfortunately, it is mistakenly cached at CDN. Therefore, instead of get the fresh update, you get a stale version. <@U22PJPGK0>"

    "text": "Cool, thanks Libo. Just a little more context - immediately after you update a CSS or JS file in Design Manager, we change the links that that are returned by `get_public_template_url` to serve the latest version directly, rather than from the CDN. That ensures that you see the latest version without you waiting for us to minify the file and upload it. In the background we complete that work and then `get_public_template_url` returns the CDN version"
