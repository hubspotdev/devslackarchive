    "text": "(from the hackaton) regarding the dnd_areas and the custom classes or IDs, and how to give us the ability to customize:\n1- One posibility is that you add a couple extra fields when creating a CM. So when for example we populate the field extra_row_class with `my-custom-class` that class will be added to the row.\n2- Although my second idea will allow us much more powerful experience to expand on our own with lot of differents features, using a snippet like so:\n```{% set myDnd = dnd_area({\"class\":\"my-area\"}) %}\n\n{% for section in myDnd %}\n\n   {% for col in section %}\n    \n   {% endfor %}\n{% endfor %}```\nThat way, we could have access to the CMs used and we could customize as needed with `|map` or any other filter to expand classes or event custom HTML if needed.\nTho I understand the \"risks\" of not using \"default layout\" from the dnd that can break third party CMs that could relay on that :thinking_face:"
