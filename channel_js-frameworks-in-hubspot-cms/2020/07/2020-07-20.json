Im not familiar at all with HubSpot, therefore i deceided to join here, i would be really greatful if some of you could help to me. Firstly i would like to know how could i implement a vue component as a modul in HubSpot. Is there a helpful article which writes step by step what i should do (I searched but have not found much)?

    "text": "Hey roland, don't have any complete walkthroughs, but when I've done this in the past I've tried to mirror the VueJS docs as closely as possible. Some of the local dev tools may make \"full\" vue development more feasible now (using webpack, building with .vue files, etc...) but I still think the easiest approach is simply using the vue library as a dependancy and writing out your app in standard js files or the module's JS window"
