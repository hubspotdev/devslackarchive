    "text": "Hi everyone, new to development in the HubSpot CMS here. Just wondering - is there a guide or are there any suggestions as to how to port a standard HTML site into the HubSpot CMS, if we don't intend to utilize any of the HubL-based front-end editing fields? (Essentially a guide to the 'bare minimum', so to speak, as all edits will still be done directly in the code/design manager itself -- just unsure what the 'non-negotiable HubL components' that would be needed to make this happen)\n\nHope that makes sense? Thanks!",

    "text": "Hey Zachary, the only _necessary_ tokens IIRC are `{{ standard_header_includes }}` and `{{ standard_footer_includes }}` <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/templates/html-hubl-templates#header-and-footer-includes>\n\nSo, in this case, you would want to create a template for each static page you have, add the two tokens in their proper order in the document (header in the head, footer just before `&lt;/body&gt;`), publish the template, and then create a page for the template. The two tags will put in the HubSpot tracking pixels as well as tie in the SEO meta info from the page editor tool."
