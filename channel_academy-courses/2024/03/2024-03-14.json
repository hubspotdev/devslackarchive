    "text": "Hi, I’m new to HubSpot. I build a theme from scratch for the practicum, but I’m stumped on the team module build. The directions are a bit vague and I don’t recall seeing how to do this in the Academy videos. It says to use ‘repeating groups of fields to allow editors to add and subtract team members’. Is there a group field? Do I wrap it with a choice field to allow for add / subtract? I have a 3 column module already built, but not sure how to make it so that an editor can do this. Also, it asks to make the layout change to 2 columns on screens below 900. I’m using flexbox for layout and can see how to get it down to 1 column on mobile devices using flex-direction, but not sure how to get it to 2 columns. Flex already shrinks and grows with the browser. Can someone point me in the right direction?",
