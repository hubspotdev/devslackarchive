    "text": "I'm trying to get a better understanding of how (and when) HubSpot CMS is a good fit for building an ecommerce site. I've built a number of HubSpot CMS sites but they've all been lead gen focused. Is it as straightforward as building templates per usual and installing 3rd integrations to handle typical ecommerce functionality like inventory tracking, payments etc? Or perhaps this is trying to fit a square peg in a round hole and it's better to build the site (or at least the store) on a Magento or Shopify. And is there a world where the ecommerce site would have the store is built on a Shopify type site and the marketing pages built on HubSpot CMS? Just trying to understand from a architectural high level where and when HubSpot CMS is a good for building ecommerce sites, thank you!",
