When someone requests a quote on our website, it automatically creates a deal with product line items attached. I'd like to send an email to the contact associated with this deal and have it dynamically pull in the values of the deal. Here's the code I have so far, but I'm unable to get it to render any values."

It looks like the code works for anyone else trying to pull in line items from Deals.  I can help out further if anyone else is having trouble with this in the future for what I did"
