    "text": "Hi All!\nIs there a way to debug if my Javascript integration is sending the .identify, .setPath and .pageView events? Currently it looks like it works, but only sometimes (I identify some visitors). I can’t understand is this tied to how HS ingests the data or the data even doesn’t get delivered. Theres an example of the code used in this post: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Triggered-JS-page-views-amp-identify-calls-do-not-display-in/m-p/685042#M56266>"
