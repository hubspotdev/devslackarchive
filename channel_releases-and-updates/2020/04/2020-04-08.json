    "text": "Hi all!\n\nWe’ve been receiving a ton of really great questions about serverless functions. To help answer some of those, I’m happy to share the event app. The event app is an <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-event-registration|open source project> that leverages serverless functions, memberships, local development, and HubDB. You can learn more about it on our <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/event-registration-app|developer website>. We know this is just one example of how to use serverless functions and we are eager to share more examples in the future. If you have any ideas or if you are getting any requests from your customers feel free to share those with us! For feedback and questions please join the conversation in the <#C011GFF8KNZ|events-app-beta> channel."
