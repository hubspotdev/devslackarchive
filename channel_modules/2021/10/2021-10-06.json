I’m trying to set default values when using a module snippet in a template.\nI have a boolean named “hide” which is grouped in “styles”. but when i want to set the default (not in the json but in the module snippet) it no works…\n\nI think it has to do with the fact that it’s grouped, but not sure obviously.\n\nIf anyone knows the correct syntax, please let me know!",

    "text": "<@U02DNBUPP9V> In addition to <@UV23JHEJY> answer. Another way to do it, without the need of blog posts, is just to look up the active tags. Useful if you compensate the missing topic filter for the blog and want to create a bunch of custom tag filters:\n\n```{% set tags_array = [] %}\n{% for tag in blog_tags(your_blog_id, 250) %}\n {% do tags_array.append( tag.name ) %}\n{% endfor %}```\nAnd then you can use:\n```{% if tags_array is containing my_tag %}\n  (...)\n{% endif %}```\nThe variable `my_tag` can be for example the `tag_field` from your module. And I highly recommend that you place the `tags_array` into a global file and import that file into your module where you want to use it. For example like this:\n\n```{% if !tags_array %}{% import '../../global.css' %}{% endif %}```\nThe reason behind this is to reduce the amount of HubL request that sometimes can happen.\n\nRelated to: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/functions#blog-tags>"
