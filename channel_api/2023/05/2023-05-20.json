Existing ID: &lt;CRMID&gt;`\nRecently, it started returning just “`Contact already exists`” in some cases.\n\nAnyone experienced that? This really breaks our flow as we cannot match the current contact id back to our db.\nI also don’t understand why the existing id  was not moved into a separate field already - there has been a request from 3 (!) years ago and leaving it as a string to parse is bad design .",
