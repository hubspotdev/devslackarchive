    "text": "Hi all! Curious if what I'm experiencing with the properties API is a bug or not.\n\nI added test values to the contact Persona property, with a `name` and a `description` filled in. When I use the properties API, these appear to be switched (see image): the `description` is now the API response's option's `label`, while the `name` has become the option's `description` . Is this behavior the same for all enumeration-type fields where we will in a description, or just the persona field, or is this somehow just unique to my account?",

    "text": "Hey <@U01QVR44MEY>, thanks for the response! I want to get as much data as possible within each page so that the integration i’m building doesn’t have to make so many requests…but as of now i’m limited by these page limits/counts, endpoints not having everything i need, or there being a cap to 10k results of the past 30 days….\n\nStill trying to figure out the best way to possibly create a historical import that isn’t EVERYTHING and capable of at least 30 days for ALL accounts, and not just being capped at 10k total results. :thinking_face:\n\nI’ve seen my scripts work really well on up to 1k records at a time in other integrations so being limited to 100 is a struggle in that it’ll never be as fast bc i have to loop 10 times in this integration where others i’m able to do 1k at a time."
