Is there a guide on how I set this up so my team can add content to specific parts of my template while leaving my core branding and responsive design intact?",

    "text": "Hey <@ULEBY9675> Yup, we definitely have some resources for that. This doc <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/hubl/hubl-module-syntax-and-parameters> shows how to put an module (what will make portions of your email editable at the email creation level in the HubSpot UI). We also have this <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/modules/getting-started> section all about creating your own modules for the team to use.  Creating custom modules will allow you to specifically control the design of the email, while allowing certain areas to edited by a non technical user using fields of your choice, like file picker, single line of text, etc."
