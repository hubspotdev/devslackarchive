I'm looking to extract specific fields like\n• Event Timestamp\n• Ad Network\n• Amount Spent\n• Row ID\n• Ad Group ID\n• Ad ID\n• Campaign ID\n• Account ID\nI haven’t found anything in the Analytics API and, also I’ve read about the Ad Performance API, but i can’t seem to locate the specific endpoint I need. Does anyone have experience with this or know which endpoints I should be using? Any advice or pointers would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks :slightly_smiling_face:"
