    "text": "Hi everyone, I have been using HubSpot for a couple months now. I've been less involved in the developing as we hire out someone for us freelance (i'm the email marketer) but I majored in CS and am looking for some help. We had a working email template but somewhere along the way it became messed up and does not format properly on many iphone devices in iOS Mail app specifically. Here is a very simple test showing how we set up a simple section in drag-drop (1) and how it appears in iOS Mail app (2). In ANY of the the mobile previewers HubSpot offers it stacks properly BTW (3) Anyone run into this issue or have ideas?",
