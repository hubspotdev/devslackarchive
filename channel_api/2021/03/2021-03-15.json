    "text": "Hi - we’ve got Fivetran set up to pull HubSpot data into our data warehouse. It’s been having problems for 1 week where syncs take hours and hours. I feel we’re being throttled on our API usage, even though I know we’re sending few API requests. We get these errors in Fivetran’s logs:\n\n```\"Some Error occurred, Retrying after 60 seconds. Error : HTTP 500 Internal Server Error\"\n\"Retrying after 60 seconds, Reason : Bad Gateway\"```\nWhere can we get some insight into this issue and whether our API usage is being throttled or blocked?",

In import API ,in case of any import errors ,we only get count of objects that failed to import.\nExample:\n`\"counters\": {`\n            `\"TOTAL_ROWS\": 6,`\n            `\"PROPERTY_VALUES_EMITTED\": 5,`\n            `\"CREATED_OBJECTS\": 1,`\n            `\"UPDATED_OBJECTS\": 4,`\n            `\"ERRORS\": 1,`\n            `\"UNIQUE_OBJECTS_WRITTEN\": 5`\n        `}`\nI am aware that we can download import error file from the application,Is there any way we can fetch failed records programmatically ?\n\n2.We can read a batch of Objects(contact,companies,deals etc.) by internal ID, or unique property values. Could anyone please provide any resources /examples as to which unique keys can be used in the respective endpoints of objects.\n\nWould really appreciate any inputs..Thanks!",
