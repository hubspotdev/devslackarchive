    "text": "Hi all. With apologies in advance if I'm asking this in the wrong place or if it's a FAQ (I _have_ searched): is there any way of seeing what an entire site would look like with a new CSS file applied and (ideally) a new version of a template?  From what I can see thus far, I can stage individual pages and then change them to use a new version of a template, but that's pretty laborious and not very practical for my use case... I really need my client to be able to navigate around their current site but with the new footer and some related CSS in place _without_ my needing to go in and manually touch every page on their site. Any help much appreciated!"
