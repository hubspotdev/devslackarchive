Initially it loads on the left next to the logo and then it moves to the permanent spot near the middle. It happens very quickly, just a flash, but I believe this is caused by how you have the position configured.\n\nWhen I uncheck this from the dev console, the menu moves back to the initial position:\n\n```.cst-hder-grp .row .cst-header-menu {\n    width: 50%;\n}```"
