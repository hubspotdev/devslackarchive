    "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have a question about workflows. I have a workflow that has a custom code that hits on multiple APIs and it essentially de-duplicates data. This whole process takes some time when I activate it to run (around 20+ hours) since i added a delay in the custom code (to solve some sync issues). My question is, when the workflow is running and a new enrolment occurs, will that will until the others are completed? So for example:\n• I put the workflow live today, and it takes some 20 hours to run to de-dupe all existing contacts\n• Meanwhile, at some point today a few new contacts are added that also need to go through this workflow\nDo the new contacts wait for the previous ones to finish? i.e: Are they queued?"
