I am hosting a simple landing with a streaming embebed and a chatroom for an online event.\nThe chat works with websockets, but HubSpot forces the connection under ssl (wss instead of ws). How can I make possible a connection to a websocket without ssl? Its a simple chat for the event so we dont need encryption.\n\nThanks! and sorry if this is the wrong channel",
