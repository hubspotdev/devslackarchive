    "text": "Hi there, I looking for a way to change the default checkboxes in a form to iOS like toggle switches. My CSS/HTML knowledge is bit limited but I'm trying my best to get this to work. The issue that I'm facing with most tutorials I find on CSS Tricks and Stackoverflow is that they are using the &lt;label&gt; to style. But since I'm trying to use this for GDPR consent on a form, the text is within a span in that label. Any thoughts?"
