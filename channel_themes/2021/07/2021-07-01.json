I’ve been checking on the status each day and it seemed to be in the “Approval pending” state until this morning when I went to check. It looks like the listings page has been updated and our listing has vanished. Even our live theme is showing as a draft, and our “sold” figures aren’t lining up with what’s showing on the actual marketplace listing, which is a bit confusing. Who’s the best person to talk about about a status update on our listing/do we need to restart the submission process..?",
