    "text": ":wave:  Hey there!\n\nWe’ve been working with the HubSpot API for a while now, and are super excited to see the V3 version. Looks like it’s much more consistent and should make parsing a lot nicer for us!\n\nOne question I have, is how do I ask for associations in the search response?\n\nWith the standard `GET /contacts` route, you can ask for them in the URL parameters like so:\n\n```curl --request GET \\\n  --url '<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts?hapikey=HubSpot_KEY&amp;limit=10&amp;associations=companies%2Cdeals&amp;archived=false>' \\\n  --header 'accept: application/json'```\nHowever, I’m *not* able to find a way to include them in the response of the `POST /contacts/search` route:\n\n```curl \"<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search?hapikey=HubSpot_KEY&amp;associations=companies%2Cdeals>\" \\\n  --request POST \\\n  --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  --data '{\n    \"associations\": \"companies,deals\",\n    \"filterGroups\":[\n      {\n        \"filters\":[\n          {\n            \"propertyName\": \"lastmodifieddate\",\n            \"operator\": \"GTE\",\n            \"value\": \"1580338387514\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }'```\nI’ve also tried using an array of associations like: `\"associations\": [\"companies\", \"deals\"]`\n\nAny ideas? (It might be that this is just not possible, but that feels odd given it’s the same data returned as the GET request)",
