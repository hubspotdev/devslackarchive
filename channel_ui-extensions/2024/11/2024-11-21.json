    "text": "For the past few hours, I have been struggling to validate the `X-HubSpot-Signature-v3` when running my project locally using `CLIENT_SECRET=\"ABC123\" hs project dev`\n\nI am using PHP and, specifically, Laravel to handle the requests. I have seen a few other threads online about this but I haven’t been able to solve the issues. I am using the HubSpot PHP SDK to validate <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-php/blob/master/lib/Utils/Signature.php|the signatures>, and I have been referring to the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/apps/authentication/validating-requests#validate-the-v3-request-signature|documentation here>. My code is almost identical to what has been posted in this GitHub issue: <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-php/issues/226>\n\nThe documentation doesn’t state what the URI is included in the signature sent from HubSpot, as the requests are proxied from the intended URL to my local environment by using `local.json`\n\nExample of the proxied request:\n```Request to <https://api.example.com/HubSpot?userEmail=richard%40wearedomo.com&userId=67188843&portalId=145437528&appId=4707988>\n[INFO] Mapping <https://api.example.com/HubSpot?userEmail=richard%40wearedomo.com&userId=67188843&portalId=145437528&appId=4707988> -> <http://api.example.test/HubSpot?userEmail=richard%40wearedomo.com&userId=67188843&portalId=145437528&appId=4707988>```\nI have exhausted all possibilities, has anyone else encountered something similar when trying to validate signatures locally?",
