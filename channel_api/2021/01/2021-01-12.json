    "text": "Hey <@U018X9HSL12> That’s because webhooks are a very thin wrapper around HubSpot’s own infrastructure and we built it to be concerned with the most granular pieces of data possible. For example a List might not care that the deal was created in a certain stage, just that it was created. It could also care about a stage change but not about deal creation. We roughly assumed that integrators would want the same level of granularity so we set it up so if you subscribed to two different events, you would get two different webhooks even if the same action triggered them.\n\nWe are considering other ways to approach this problem. I’d love to hear your thoughts on where you’d like to see us take this"
