    "text": "Good morning, I hope you are doing well.\nRecently I have been confirmed by HubSpot that for a new incoming email that we automatically associate with the contact and company record from the sender, HS associate this email with the last 5 deals where the same sender is associated and this is hampering the work from our sales team. This functionality is native from HubSpot but I was wondering if there could be any workaround via API, or something to not associate this emails or delete this association via API. Any suggestion idea?",

When a Contact is created/updated use Geo location from HubDB and standardize properties in Contact. Solution should be without Ops Hub Pro.\n•  Solution A: Use Webhook Public App Subscription that posts real-time Contact Create/Update payload to a URL (middleware). Allow middleware to query HubDB and then update the Contact properties appropriately.\n•  Solution B: Private App Token set up and then use Postman (or PowerAutomate) to run a \"cron job\" that queries Contact last created/updated in 15min interval. Use the Contacts and perform queries to HubDB API and update the Contacts (Contact API) appropriately.\nAm I missing anything? Any other solution?",
