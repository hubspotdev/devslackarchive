All was going well until I noticed that HubSpot adds in their own styling, I managed to find the right ID's and Class's to override this after a bit of hunting. I'm now finding that I have the same issue again but it's only effecting the email in Outlook clients. Are there any obvious CSS overrides I can perform to get rid of these styles? It adds in white padding and a single pixel grey border around the edge?",
