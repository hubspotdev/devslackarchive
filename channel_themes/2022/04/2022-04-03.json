    "text": "Hello Everyone. I’m more or less new to the HubSpot CMS but I built a ton of website with TYPO3. I do understand how templates for HubSpot are generated and I also did already some modules. I’m just curious whats your best practise to develop a new theme is. I usually started off with the bootstrap framework and added in SCSS what ever I needed and built all the modules locally before I took them into TYPO3. If you have a design from a UX designer and wanted that working in HubSpot, do you write the CSS based on the HubSpot CSS framework and then add the DND components?",
