    "text": "What would be the use case? Bearing in mind that in HubSpot language server-less functions generally refer to cms endpoint functions or crm app functions. Likely what you want is a custom code action which runs on a schedule (still a server-less function, albeit by a different name).\n\nThere's some advantages to custom code actions 20s run time, and a plethora of trigger options. The main disadvantage is the copy paste work until the new workflows api is ready since you can't deploy them from the cli.\n\nThe developers blog has an excellent write up by Jon McLaren on using custom objects to schedule cron jobs: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/blog/how-to-write-cron-jobs-in-HubSpot-to-take-time-based-action-on-crm-data>"
