We do lots of campaigns so I have to add this to the CSS file for EVERY form so I have like 30. Instead of cleaning it up I'm building a new drag and drop template and I think my solution will be to add the code specific to the form in the MODULE then just target the form using the name of my template which is also the top class....example `class=\"case-studies-global-01\"` then no matter what form is dropped in that section it will format the same."
