And that does work.\nUtterly useless, but it work.\nYou can set the threadID and messageID to whatever you like, does not have to be unique.\nBut somewhere there is a relationship between the value of the messageID / ThreadID and the email.\nI honestly can't find where.\nI did run a full query through all properties in GraphQL, but there is no match to those values.\nSpooky actions.
