    "text": "Any freelancers in this group?\n\n I’m having quite some success with my LinkedIn marketing (views between 400-1,200 per post, 2-4 weekly connection requests in my target market, etc,).\n\nMost of that success is due to a group of people who get together at a specific time to like and comment on each other’s post, thereby gaming the algorithm that favors people with HUGE audiences. I’m looking to create a similar group (the other one is exclusive). If you’d like to participate, please send me an IM. Note that you have to:\n\n1. Commit to be on LinkedIn between between 6-7 AM Pacific, a minimum of three weekdays per week, M-F \n2. Commit to BOTH comment and like everyone else’s post\n3. Commit to include an engagement question with each post so as to make it easier for everyone else to comment\n4. Commit to remove yourself from the group when you’re no longer able/willing to participate\nI would be more than happy to share my strategies with you, and help you get started.  Please DM me if you’d like to participate. Cheers!"
