    "text": "Hello, do you know maybe what is the most optimal way to put video on website hosted on HubSpot? I read that HubSpot native videos are slower than some solutions, any ideas? Example here <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Change-Video-play-icon-on-Custom-Module/td-p/674184> Someone suggested lightweight youtube embed plugin. Does any of you have experience in that?\nEspecially with a webpage that has like 10-15 videos on it"
