I made a landing page from the that template and went into `settings &gt; advanced &gt; edit template`. This edits the master template so I can’t make more landing pages off the original template that I downloaded. Should I clone the template folder and rename all the files and then edit that? I just want to shift some things around and use our own branding styles.",
