    "text": "Might be a dumb question but I’ll risk it: we need a way to send events from our platform to HubSpot. The catch: the events must be sent from the client (a plugin on top of an ms-office product), as opposed to from the back-end. This means we can’t use any API call that authenticates via the api key, for obvious security reasons. Anyone who’s done it and can point me in the right direction, including confirming there’s no way to do it except from the backend? Tnx!"
