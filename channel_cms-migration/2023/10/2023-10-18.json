    "text": "Hi all, a lead of mine has migrated from Pipedrive to HubSpot. Prior to the migration, there was a lack of understanding how emails in Pipedrive work. Basically there are email activities, and then logged emails. HubSpot can only sync the first kind and the client really wants all historical emails logged in HubSpot as well. I've worked with their developers to discover that Pipedrive uses something called MailThreads and it's possible to transfer them with some developer magic. However we are not sure how the association would work, would it be possible to pull the id of the associated id in Pipedrive and then associate the same email with the right contact, company and deal record in HubSpot? Thanks for any help!",
