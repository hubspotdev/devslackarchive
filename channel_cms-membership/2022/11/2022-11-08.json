    "text": "Hi there!\nI’m facing an issue with the HS membership login form but it’s hard to pinpoint since it’s occurring apparently under some unknown circumstances. A colleague of mine and I have been rarely encountering that, while one of the client’s testers seems to deal with it almost always.\nThe thing is that, after entering email and password and finally submitting, a \"an unexpected error occurred\" error message appears on the screen, without any errors reported in the network tab of dev tools. What is weird is that apparently this happens only on the first try to access, that is if a user retries to log in after that they actually succeed. All tests have been performed in incognito mode, just to be sure there are no cookies or cache in the way. Also, the client’s tester has been performing tests almost exclusively from a VDI, I don’t know if there may be a correlation with the type of network being used.\nBesides not knowing what might cause this strange behavior, I’m unable to investigate in any meaningful way since this is a HS system form (kind of black boxy, isn't it?). Any hints on what is causing this? Thank you.",
