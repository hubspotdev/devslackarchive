    "text": "Hello everybody.\nI have some crucial questions about the new quote templates of HubSpot, can someone help me to find the answer to them?\n\n1. How do I split up elements of a Line inside the template, are products library restricting us from doing this?\n2. Does quote templates support Global Modules like themes? If so, can I put it to a theme page and edit it to make it globally inside quote templates?\n3. Is it possible to change how the calculation of the templates values work? For example, can I create a module where does this contain one or more text fields that can act as variables that alter the calculation of the existing values of the table pulled by HubSpot? I know we can change the JavaScript of it, and this is not recommended, but I want to know if that’s possible.",

    "text": "1. To loop through line items in a table you can use a for loop. Specifically, it would look like:\n```{% for item in template_data.quote.associated_objects.line_items %}\n{# Add the markup and items you want to reference #}\n{% endfor %}```\n2. Unfortunately, not at this time. However, the entire template is somewhat ‘global’ as a meta template is generated from that, and then a quote is created from the meta template\n3. I’m not sure that I’m 100% following, but the values that are calculated in the app should be available via personalization tokens (ptokens) and variables. You can create custom calculations using either JS or HubL operators and output those, but most of the calculations should be available using our variables."

Basically breaking out parts of the table beyond just the lines themselves\nYes, kind of. For example if you needed to display the information in a way that 1 for loop didn’t allow, you could loop again through each item to output in the HTML wherever you want.\n\nI would recommend though keeping it all in 1 row in the table element as that’s better for accessibility."
