    "text": "Hi HubSpot team! I’m currently using the Focus theme for my website at <http://roguerose.com|roguerose.com>. When I view on my mobile the header is just a black bar.\n\nI chatted with HubSpot support and they said: “I’ve inspected the page and it looks like there is a CSS code in the stylesheet for the module or theme that is set to black for mobile. You’ll want to adjust this code to correct the mobile view. I recommend reaching out to our *<https://developers.HubSpot.com/slack|Community Developer Slack Group>* or our *<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Developers/ct-p/developers|Developer Forums>* for further assistance on where to make the exact changes”\n\n**How can I update the header on mobile to show my logo and not a black bar?",
