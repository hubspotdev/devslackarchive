HubSpot unfortunately doesn't support some of the advanced features code anywhere uses in FTP(such as numerous concurrent FTP sessions) and i have not yet found a completely reliable configuration in codeanywhere for that.  Though if one wanted, because HubSpot FTP is really just a facade for HubSpots apis you could definitely use the apis instead. I have not tried that yet.\n\nI have asked HS FTP staff to try to add support for the features codeanywhere tries to use and their reply was basically as far as they know its not among the most popular FTP clients and the features its using may be difficult to support, therefore there were no plans at the time to actively try to support it"
