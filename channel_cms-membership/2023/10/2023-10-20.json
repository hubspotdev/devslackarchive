    "text": "<@U03QEU2MF5G> if the portal has the correct access you could use the global form events to run a serverless function that checks for the contact.. If the contact is found it returns the \"you are a already subscribed user\" message and if it displays the default HS message. Now this wont stop the submission from happening as per <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/global-form-events|this document>, so you would need to change the way HS handles that forms submissions => membership.\n\nLet me know if I can answer any questions!"
