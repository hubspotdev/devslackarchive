    "text": "Hey <@U01CT57M9A8> The `webhookUri` let’s the user kick off an import from HubSpot App. It tells your app to start sending data to the `/import` endpoints of the ecommerce bridge.  Some more details are <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/ecomm-bridge/v2/supporting-imports-with-the-ecommerce-bridge|here> if you haven’t come accross that page before. If you had something else in mind about automating the process let me know and I’ll see if I can help"

    "text": "Hi <@UFBNA9K9A>. Thank you for your reply! So should I be creating an app in HubSpot Developers to send my website's contacts, deals, products, and line item properties into HubSpot then instead of just the Bridge API alone?\n\nThe end goal I'm looking for is to automatically update the mapping properties with new data as contacts are created and orders get placed on our website."

    "text": "The ecomm bridge API can work with an app or your accounts API key, it just depends on if you intended to distribute it beyond your own company. If you do, then us a HubSpot app and OAuth. Otherwise you can stick with your API key.\n\nWhen I referred to the HubSpot App, I meant the UI that a user would log into and click around in. That’s where the `webhookUri` gets called from.\n\nTo update data,  you should use the `/sync` endpoints. You can send sync messages whenever you have a new order in your shopping cart and that will update the mapped properties in HubSpot"
