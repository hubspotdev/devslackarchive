    "text": "HTML or Drag-and-Drop â€” that is the question. I am a designer and sometime developer who is not overly familiar with the HubSpot system. I have been building templates in HTML/HUBL. We have hired a marketing CRO consultant to help out, and she is saying that this is not right, that the pages need to be built in Drag-and-Drop. Is this correct? What would be the reason for that? How do most people work with the Design Manager here? My view is that HTML gives more custom control over the design and functionality. My concern would be that drag-and-drop will limit us to the functionality of the available modules and give a more cookie-cutter site (the way that bootstrap sites can tend to have a bootstrap look). Am I wrong and I should adopt the drag-and-drop approach?",
