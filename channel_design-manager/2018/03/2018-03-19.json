    "text": "Hey everyone, here's a question re: page load with the new custom modules. How are you guys utilizing the new modules for layouts?. I know that most of our mocked up templates could use custom modules for most sections that are built out on a website (For example an equal 4 spot content section) - This allows us to rapidly build a variety of inside page layouts.  For modules that are going to be used in multiple locations do you put the CSS for the entire module section in the module editor or put it in the global stylesheet for the website?",

    "text": "Oops I was wrong, we were looking at the code in the preview template URL which doesn't minify. :stuck_out_tongue: that makes sense and what we were leaning towards doing - core functionality in the modules and styles in a sheet, it's just a lot easier for transferring modules around and maintaining the styles, but we could also add a stylesheet specific to modules for transfer purposes. I was just wondering how people are getting around this for best usability and re-usability."
