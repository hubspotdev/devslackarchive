    "text": "Hi all, I have an idea, but didn't know if someone else had done it so I don't have to recreate it, or if it's a brand new idea.  We've been running into an issue where closed - won deals are occuring without an associated contact record. This in turn prevents those contacts from enrolling into automated workflows that are related to their recently closed deal. Is there a way to use a Deal to Contact <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/crm-associations/crm-associations-overview>, and combine it with this code <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/crm-associations/get-associations> to find a saved email on the deal record (we save a signor's email address to the deal) on a contact record and associate the two objects along with adding the association label?",
