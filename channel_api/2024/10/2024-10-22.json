I don't think it's possible to update primary email via API, but I can update secondary email via API (link to doco: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts#secondary-emails>). Is that correct? If so I'm thinking about a workaround where we update the secondary email address and then have a manual process to go and check and set the new email as primary.",
