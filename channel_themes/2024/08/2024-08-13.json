    "text": "Hi! I am new here but am struggling! We have a new theme and need a module from the old theme... In design manager, I cloned and moved it and an HTML file that it uses over to the new theme. I made sure the module file have the correct path for the HTML file and put the module on the page through the drag and drop. It is only sort of working... I cannot seem to get all the feature and the cards to work. Can someone please help? I feel like it should just work since both files were cloned and moved to the new theme.",

    "text": "Hi <@U07GB42UU0P>, most likely your module depends on some classes and maybe JS from the old theme.\nMake sure to move those parts too\n\nTip: Don't copy the whole CSS files to the new theme since they might interfere with other styles.\nFrom my experience - if you're moving a module from theme A to theme B it's best to copy just the needed CSS classes/stylings and change the classes(in the module and CSS) so it won't interfere with something.\n\nAlso: If you're moving a module from a marketplace theme to another - don't do it. The modules are part of a theme, which belongs to the theme creator and they have some sort of licence on it.\nSo best practise(\"Gentlemens agreement\") for something like this is always: *develop your own version/custom module*. You can use the existing module as inspiration and look at how it was created but create a module which fully integrates into your new theme"
