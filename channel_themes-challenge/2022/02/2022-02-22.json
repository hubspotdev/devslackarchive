    "text": "No, you’re fine Sergery. They sent out an email about the situation, you might’ve missed it. They’re treating the 2 things entirely separately (the contest and marketplace). As long as you managed to submit your theme entry in by January 31th, you’re good for the contest.\n\nHere’s a copy of the email:\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt;  We’ve received feedback about confusion regarding the “Marketplace submission” period in the rules, and thus we’ve made the following clarifying updates to the rules and schedule:\n&gt; • The judging period will encompass all of February, and we’re eliminating the Marketplace Approval period as a standalone phase.\n&gt; • We’re reminding all participants *that submissions are being judged on their state according to the contest close date, January 31st.* Some modifications may be required for final acceptance of submissions into the marketplace. More details are in the “_Modifications after the Submission Period_” section of the rules.\n&gt; We’ll announce semi-finalists on February 28th, and prize winners on March 8th, per the challenge schedule.\n&gt; \n&gt; While not all of you can be prize winners of the challenge, we’d love to get as many themes submitted into the HubSpot Asset Marketplace as possible, so be sure to review any feedback provided in the coming weeks and understand if your theme is missing requirements or elements which prevent it from being accepted into the marketplace.\n&gt; \n&gt; Questions?\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have any questions about the hackathon, please post on the <http://e.customeriomail.com/e/c/eyJlbWFpbF9pZCI6IlJBZ0JBQUYtNm1idkhtekV1MUdDWkhjZHE1Zz0iLCJocmVmIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9odWJzcG90LmRldnBvc3QuY29tL2ZvcnVtX3RvcGljcyIsImludGVybmFsIjoiMDg3MGY0NDRmNGNlY2QwMSJ9/69573a7045506dbb0d6956544efc38cc46a86589ea34e78f8d9a3f7a0274f197|discussion forum>."
