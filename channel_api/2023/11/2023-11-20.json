Additionally, you can learn more about the definition of a list and its filters at the newly published docs <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/lists-filters|here> and <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/list-filters-definitions|here>.\n\nAs a quick note, because lists is currently undergoing a change to its time filter format, all time-based filters have been disabled for create/update as part of this initial release of List CRUD operations.\n\nPlease join us over at <#C05T36XTUBF|lists-api-v3> for any questions or comments you have regarding this API.
