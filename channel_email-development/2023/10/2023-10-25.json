For one section of it, I'm trying to have 4 \"columns\" and then on smaller devices I'd like a 2x2 column style. I've tried using media queries which work on HubSpots preview of the module but they dont actually work when added to an email. anyone have any ideas? would really appreciate it",

    "text": "Thanks for the tag, <@U049YGVBGBC>! I would agree, MJML is absolutely the way to go for creating emails outside of the standard builder experience.\n\nHowever, there _is_ a potential workaround for creating responsive layouts in custom email builder modules: you can steal the various layout/grid classes from email builder markup. I can’t guarantee this would work, but I _think_ you could create the layout you described with markup that looks like this:\n```&lt;div class=\"hse-column-container\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"hse-column hse-size-6\"&gt;\n    &lt;table&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;!-- content --&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;!-- content --&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n      &lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/table&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"hse-column hse-size-6\"&gt;\n    &lt;table&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;!-- content --&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;!-- content --&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n      &lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/table&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;```\nI left out all of the styles and Outlook-specific markup for clarity, but those can also be nabbed by inspecting the source of an email builder email.\n\nIt doesn’t sound like you need this right now, but it’s a handy technique to keep in your back pocket in case you ever need more flexibility out of your custom email modules. Fingers crossed we’ll get `{% require_css %}` in emails someday soon, so we don’t need workarounds or custom templates for better mobile layouts!"
