We currently have two blogs within our blogs domain - one live and one sandbox-test version - but we would like to exclude the test blog content from showing up in the site search results. It’s neither possible through the search query parameters nor is it very clean to filter out the test posts after the search Get request. Would robots.txt be a viable alternative?",
