    "text": "I think someone from HS might be best to answer this. From what I can gather, they are worried that by cloning their existing dmv1 module and implementing dmv2 fields to replace some of what is happening, this will cause their content to get blown away.\n\nIdeally, simply upgrading the module and keeping all names the same for the fields shouldn't cause any breakage/removal of content.\n\nTo accurately help him, someone would need access to the portal to review things but I know (at least from my standpoint) that would hold whoever goes to help him responsible for that content. It's the type of question I am not sure many would take without them being a retainer client (or a freelancer account)"
