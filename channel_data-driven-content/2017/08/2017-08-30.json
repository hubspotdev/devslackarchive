    "text": "Curious how people handle development for HubDB-enabled templates without access on their designer accounts? We have a number of client portals using it (which is where I learned the ropes) but it'd be good to test super-experimental things on our own designer portals first before releasing templates to the masses. Thoughts? Is this something reserved for those who are willing to fork over the $300 / month on their own portals to learn?"

    "text": "<@U4RP6AGV9> I think every Partner has access to a full-featured portal that is separate from your core agency portal. That's where we do our experimenting. I've felt since day one that every partner should be given a full-featured portal for their agency to use and learn with, but this is what was offered instead. Still works, just limits real-life experimentation if your agency isn't paying for enterprise or whatever."
