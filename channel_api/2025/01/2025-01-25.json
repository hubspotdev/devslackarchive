I'm not sure that this is the right channel to ask help with our problem, sorry about that, but I couldn't find a better place in first glance...\nWe have SAAS product, and we are using HubSport as CRM tool. Our site has the HS plugin, but we are only using the chat functionality at the moment.\nWe would like to targeting our users with CTAs based on their email addresses after login, and we did the recommended steps by doing the identification via  Visitor Identification API, setup the credentials to the js plugin(tracking code snipet)\n• we tried with hsConversationsSettings\n• and another desperate attempt `_hsq.push([\"identify\", { {identity details} }]);`\nBut still, all the CAT appears only if we set the \"Logged in Visitor = false\", and of course the segmented list with specific email addresses doesn't work either, because it looks like we can not pass the identifiers in the right place.\nI know it's a bit messy, but any advice would be appreciated! :pray: // Angular FE, Java BE",
