However, when I tested the module html + css + js code on HubSpot, the counting numbers did not work.\nCould somebody please assist me in determining the cause and offering a solution?

    "text": "Hey <@U03BRQRSUN9> — It’s difficult to really give any advice on this without seeing it on a page. My guess is that there is likely a console error that tells you what is going on. If youre using some JS libraries chances are they are not being included in the HS version of this. Also possible that your JS is running before it should.\n\nCan you put this on a test page and send a link for us to check out?"
