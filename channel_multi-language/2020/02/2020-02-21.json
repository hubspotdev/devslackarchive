    "text": ":point_up_2:Mansi’s right, you could do this using Smart rules - though there’s a limit, I think it’s 20 smart rules per element, so if you have more than 20 countries that won’t really work. And you could also have the emails display different info. The whole setup might be a bit much if you have many countries.\n\nHere’s another idea, and it depends on how you’d want/need the distributor info to appear in the email: Contact properties (as personalization tokens in the email). You could make a workflow that sets the correct distributor info into a contact property (or a few) based on what the contact fills in for Country. If it’s a simple line-item, or a few lines (address, phone, email), that could work and would be easier to set up than smart content - you’d just need one email per language, the tokens would do the rest."
