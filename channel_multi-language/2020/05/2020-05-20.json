    "text": "Okay <@UGY22E2KC>, I now know how I found the article above. Through the CMS reference docs about multi-language content (<https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/features/multi-language-content|https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/features/multi-language-content>) I found a link to this page (<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/cos-general/how-to-manage-multi-language-content-with-HubSpots-cos|https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/cos-general/how-to-manage-multi-language-content-with-HubSpots-cos>) and there was the note on blog languages with a link to the article (see picture). Thanks for the talk today, hope to see some of the improvements we discussed soon!",
