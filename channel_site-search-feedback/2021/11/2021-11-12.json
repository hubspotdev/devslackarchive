    "text": "What is HubSpot's view on site search analytics? We've taken the search results and search input modules and customized them so that we get a great search experience, but marketing really wants to understand *WHAT* people are searching for. We intercept the form submit via JS and then do a window.location.href to redirect the user, so we can trigger events, we can modify the query string they are about to be redirected to, really anything.\n\nThe possibilities we have evaluated internally are:\n\n1. Custom behavioral events tied to form submission whereby we set the default \"Search Term\" property and the event is \"Did Search\". This works well but good luck getting any reporting on the custom behavioral events to work correctly.\n2. Intercept the form submit and adding a UTM_TERM in hopes that this now makes the term available in some of the website analytics reporting.\nUltimately the goal is just to figure out what people search for that our website doesn't make super obvious so that we can improve and augment our content and pages.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated."
