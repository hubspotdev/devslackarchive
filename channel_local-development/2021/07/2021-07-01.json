The problem is that when I build the assets and upload them to HubSpot, HubSpot CLI throws an error with validating JavaScript and doesn't upload it. The error is sth like this:\n```[ERROR] Error validating template.\n[ERROR] line 2: Error parsing 'const r=t[0]?`on key \"${t[0]}\"```\nI see that it doesn't like `const` because if I compile it to ES5 it works. But I don't want to compile it to ES5 (we don't need to support very old browsers and we don't want to bring in a lot of polyfills). Any way to fix this?"
