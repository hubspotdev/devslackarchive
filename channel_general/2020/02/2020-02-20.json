But I’m getting an issue where I can see the workflow triggered instantly, but the create deal isn’t working until up to 4 mins later, this obviously means our process doesn’t work half the time. Does anyone know why the workflows happen so slowly?",

I’m looking to track the CTAs on my site.\n\nI’ve noticed that when you create a button under `Marketing &gt; Lead Capture &gt; CTAs` and copy the embed code, its actually an image. This concerns me for several reasons;\n\n• I’m dynamically scaling all my fonts using RFS and an image won’t scale.\n• Even if it did scale the size of the image it would appear blurry on high res displays who have an increased zoom\n• I’ve already built a bunch of button modules and would like editors to be able to simply assign tracking to an existing module rather than scrapping it and embedding an image. \nAnyone have ideas on this?",
