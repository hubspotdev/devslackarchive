    "text": "Hello everyone.\n\nI have a small challenge.  In Quotes, we use the \"line item table\" element.  We display product, description, quantity and price.  The challenge is the Description field comes out right-justified in the quote and that doesn't look good.  I want to left-justify the description field but can't find a way to do it nor could support help.  They think this will require DesignManager, which I am just becoming familiar with.  They suggested this forum.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated."
