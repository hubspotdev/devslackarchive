I've got around 350 live workflows so it's always a bit of a hassle to dig through the response and find the right one.\nNot the end of the world, but would be great if that ID worked similarly to property internal references where you could find it directly in the workflow settings somewhere? (unless that is possible and I've completely missed it?)",

    "text": "Hi <@U06H94JKK1P> :wave: the Workflow ID is visible within the URL (when viewing/editing a specific Workflow). For example, if I'm editing a Workflow, the URL should look something like this:\n```<https://app-eu1.HubSpot.com/workflows/12345/platform/flow/67890/edit>```\nIn this example, the first number (left to right - 12345) is the HubSpot Portal ID. The second number (left to right - 67890) is the Workflow ID. I hope that helps :slightly_smiling_face:"
