    "text": "Hi everyone, I have two tickets - *3166777574* and *3772262891*. They both have one conversation attached to it (different conversation for each ticket). On both of them, I will make the exact same API call:\n\n• *GET* to `<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/tickets/>*3166777574*?associations=conversations` \n    ◦ Response:\n```\"conversations\": {\n    \"results\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"3941110766\",\n            \"type\": \"ticket_to_conversation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"127753355746\",\n            \"type\": \"ticket_to_conversation_v2\"\n        }\n    ]\n}```\n• *GET* to `<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/tickets/>*3772262891*?associations=conversations` \n    ◦ Response:\n```\"associations\": {\n    \"conversations\": {\n        \"results\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"145581535990\",\n                \"type\": \"ticket_to_conversation_v2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}```\nWhile the *3166777574* contains both *ticket_to_conversation* and *ticket_to_conversation_v2,* the *3772262891* only contains *ticket_to_conversation_v2.* \n\nWhen I then try to make API call to `<https://api.hubapi.com/conversations/v3/conversations/threads/3941110766/messages>` , I will get messages back. When I, however, make a call to either `<https://api.hubapi.com/conversations/v3/conversations/threads/127753355746/messages>` or `<https://api.hubapi.com/conversations/v3/conversations/threads/145581535990/messages>`, I will get 404. It means that only *ticket_to_conversation* is valid ID for pulling messages from thread and I am unable to find any endpoint for pulling them from *ticket_to_conversation_v2.*\n\n*Questions:*\n\n• Is there any (maybe undocumented) endpoint for pulling messages from *ticket_to_conversation_v2?*\n• Why am I not getting *ticket_to_conversation* ID on some tickets when they clearly exist (I can find it in HubSpot's UI)?",

    "text": "Dear HubSpot Developer Team,\nI hope this message finds you well. We are in the process of integrating our own live chat product with HubSpot's agent live chat system. This integration is crucial for ensuring seamless communication between our customers and agents via HubSpot. However, we've encountered several significant issues due to gaps in the official HubSpot API documentation:\n \n*No Endpoints for Sending Messages:*\nThe HubSpot documentation does not provide endpoints for sending messages from customers to agents. This gap severely limits our ability to facilitate   direct communication through our live chat product.\n*No Endpoints for Checking Agent Availability:*\n There are no documented endpoints for checking agent availability. This makes it difficult for our system to accurately determine if an agent is available to   respond to customer queries.\n *Missing Endpoint for Initializing Conversations:*\n We require an endpoint to initialize conversations, which is not documented. This is essential for starting new interactions between customers and agents, and its absence hinders the initiation of new conversations from our system.\n\nWe also have a company-specific requirements document and a detailed flow of how our live chat system interacts with third-party systems, which we can share with a HubSpot developer if further specifications are needed.\nCould these issues be resolved if we are provided with any internal APIs that might not be publicly documented?",
