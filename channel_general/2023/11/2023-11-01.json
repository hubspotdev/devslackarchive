    "text": "Hello guys, I have a nice challenge for you! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n*Scenario:* I have a list of deals with contacts and line items associated, which have been imported through an integration. Each contact has an External ID, which will be added to each line items (of the deals associated) that the contact owns. So, for example, in a deal with 3 contacts and 3 line items, each line item will have the External ID of one of the contacts, depending if he actually owns the product or not.\n\n*Question:* How can we have a list of contacts who own a particular product?\nMy idea was to create a workflow that takes all the External IDs of the line items from a particular product, and create a list of contacts who has those External IDs, but without Custom Code is quite impossible (we donâ€™t have Operational Hub Professional). Anyone has a different solution?"
