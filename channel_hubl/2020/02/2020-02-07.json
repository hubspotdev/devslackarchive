For example I have a dropdown property with the ID 'job_title' and I want to output the labels on a page.\n\nI know I could create a custom field for this and populate the values there, but I'm trying to avoid the duplication of data entry for bigger properties (e.g. country selection)"

I know I can use `content_by_id()` to get that, but there is a limit on how many times you can use that on one page, so I'm not able to get what I want. Is there an easy way around this limitation?"
