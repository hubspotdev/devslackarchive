I'm using the exact same command (with different module name) you mentioned.\n`npx hs create LandingHeader`\nIt created the module perfectly fine, but when I try adding it to the local hubl server, it throws the mentioned error.\nAlso, please note that I created a different empty directory under the `custom` folder to keep this module and other files separate from demo (vast) theme."
