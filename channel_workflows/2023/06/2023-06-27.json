    "text": "Does anyone know how I can include a personalisation token in a webhook URL? Basically I'm sending out a webhook, the reponse then provides the token, and I need to send another response that uses this token in the URL. But I can't find a way anywhere that will allow me to include it in the send webhook action. I tried doing it directly from a code block using Requests in Python, but it just injects escape characters into the payload."
