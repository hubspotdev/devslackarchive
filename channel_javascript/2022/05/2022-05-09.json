    "text": "The DatePicker field has been built very badly by HubSpot, (Massively fails Accessibility tests as you can’t choose a date if you navigate by keyboard and they have extra validation which means I can’t set dates with JS here in the UK with dd/mm/yy format) HubSpot are aware of this issue and have said they’re building new form code which follows accessibility guidelines but it looks like we’re stuck with what we’ve got for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever I did find looking for the change on the input field, input div and date picker popup allowed me to add some custom validation\n\n```$('.hs_my_custom_date_property').on('change','.pika-day,.input,input',function(){\n\n});```"
