I created a module for related posts, and I'm trying to have the related post content appear on every post (currently it's only showing on two of them). The relevancy itself isn't really important, the goal is simply to have new post suggestions at the bottom of every post. I read in documentation that adding more values (like tags) can increase the diversity of posts appearing, but I don't seem to be having any luck with that. Any suggestions on how I could tweak the code to have it show on every page?",
