As of right now, there are 0 errors or warnings on both files (though I did fix warnings that did exist), but despite my best efforts, they are still failing to minify on page load. Has anyone experienced this and possibly know of a fix?",

Turns out that some process over on HubSpot's side was caching the old version of the CSS file that had errors in it. I had to rename the CSS file to something else other than its previous filename, then the file minified."
