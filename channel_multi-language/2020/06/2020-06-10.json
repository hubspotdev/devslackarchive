(Same for global modules :+1:)\nI noticed that the information about available translations for the blog listing page is only available on post level. I would have expected for it to be visible in `content.translated_content` as well - like for pages. We use that information in our language switcher. Since the functionality is in betaâ€¦ will this be available?",
