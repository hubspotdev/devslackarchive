I have included all the necessary .js and .css but it's just not working. I'm using the .html template option because that made more sense to me. It seems like I get different results when I include the .js in different places. Depending on where I put it I get a Jquery not defined error or an error with the function in the js file. Where do I begin to trouble shoot this stuff?",
