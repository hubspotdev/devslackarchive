    "text": "Hello. Anyone having hints on why a HS website is indexed as \"http\" on Google?\nI was facing this situation some days ago when this was notified to me, so I went to the Domains tab inside Settings and saw HSTS set among security headers on the primary domain but the \"require HTTPS\" flag was not checked, so I enabled it. Strangely enough though I went to the Sitemap tab and I noticed that the primary domain from the dropdown was listed as \"http\", as well as all the pages here displayed, but if I would view the XML file I could see all URLs with \"https\".\nNow, just in the last hours, it's weird because not only is the \"require HTTPS\" not flagged anymore (no one actively changed it as far as I know) but I'm trying again to search for the website on Google and I can see the home page indexed with \"https\" but not other pages like the \"contact us\" one.\nThis fluctuating behavior is somewhat puzzling to me, anyone has some insights about this and how/where to investigate? Thanks.",
