    "text": "Hey everyone, i need some guidance on the submission of the academy course \"HubSpot Architecture I: Data Models and APIs\".\n\nThe course says \"Copy the shareable link to this page...\" i finished filling the editable pdf online and locally but when i copy the link of the editable pdf and open it in another window, the document is empty? Am i sharing it correctly? Also when i reload the page the entire document becomes empty again.\n\nCould i just upload the file or rather not?\n\nIdk if i'm allowed to share the course or the public editable pdf since the course is for HubSpot partners only."
