    "text": "Hi! I've been having trouble while trying to remove the hotjar integration with our HubSpot account. A while ago, we did the integration so we could get a feedback button that appears on the right side of our pages, and it worked ok but now we need to remove it. I tried going to the integrations panel and removed the hotjar item from there, and even went to tools &gt; website &gt; pages, to edit the site header html, where we had also applied a tracking code from hotjar. None of that has worked however, and the button continues appearing. Is there any chance I could get some help from you to find out what is it that I am missing to remove that button successfully?"
