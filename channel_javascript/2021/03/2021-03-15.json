Use serverless functions to hit the HubSpot Blog API to get post information using AJAX, then render posts as the user scrolls using the resulting payload\n2. Use HubL to get recent blog posts and format the data as JSON stored in a JS object variable. Then as a user scrolls, render more posts from that data object until you reach the end of the listing."
