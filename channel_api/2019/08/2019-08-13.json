If you’d like, I’d be happy to set up some time for for us to chat (either in real time or over slack) to help introduce you to some of things you aren’t familiar with so I can use that to create better getting started docs"

If you're using it with an app, the best solution is to use an environment variable and gitignore that file, that way you can commit and share your code without exposing the key.\n\nif that's not your use-case, feel free to reach out and I'll help where I can"
