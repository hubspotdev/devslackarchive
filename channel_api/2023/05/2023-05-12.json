However, in cases where multiple currencies are available in your Deal, it's not clear whether this value is in USD or EUR. I was wondering how I can obtain both the value and symbol for the currency :thinking_face:"

However, considering that users can choose between a company currency or a deal currency for a custom currency property, the value I receive, such as 10000, could be either in USD (using the company symbol) or in EUR (using the deal symbol).
