    "text": "Can I get clarification on this? We recently created a new homepage for a client and wanted to share the preview link for their C-suite to preview. Sending them a preview link of the template required a login, which they did not want to force the executives to have to do. So, instead I staged a page in content staging and that worked fine. What confuses me is that the content staging preview link is <http://www-cproperties-com.staging.hs-sites.com|www-cproperties-com.staging.hs-sites.com>. According to the changlog hs-sites should require a login. Is it because we have connected <http://cproperties.com|cproperties.com> and that subdomain removes the login requirement?"
