From what I’m reading it seems like I now need to do two calls. GET membership, then POST Object (0-1) Search",

Regarding the difference in the endpoints, the former returns objects in the order that they joined the list and the latter returns them in order of their object ID.\n\nThe list endpoints will just provide the object IDs, if you need object properties then you will need to use some other API to fetch properties for the objects (such as object search)."
