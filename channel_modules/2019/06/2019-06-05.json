Do you have a solution for last-child - i could not remove the pipe after my last li… display none removed the li alltogehter obviously.  - another question… is the only way to figure out what style/class to target by inspecting rendered code or searching .css file? is there documentation or examples somewhere that you’ve found helpful."
