    "text": "What is the proper way to use the _*<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/contacts/get_recently_updated_contacts|Get recently modified and created contacts>*_ endpoint? We're seeing items in this list that are being indexed late so we're missing them when polling. Eg. We call the endpoint and get a list of contacts - they are in Ascending order for `lastmodifieddate` . A couple of minutes later we make the same request and should expect the same results however there are _new_ contacts in the list but they are older than the most recently modified.\nIt seems like this makes this endpoint unusable as contacts are easily missed. There appears to be some sort of indexing delay. Is there an alternative to using this endpoint aside from webhooks",

So you wouldn’t want to call them from a browser as you’d be exposing your API key.\n\n\nExample: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts>\n\nThis API requires authentication through OAuth or API key.
