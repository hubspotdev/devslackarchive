If you’re using more than one in a template, I’m getting an issue were HubSpot is randomly making one entry “global” and printing it in all the others. I’ve checked and the code is completely different in each, but the result is something is repeating things on the backend. Very strange and completely killed my ability to finish a project. Any ideas?",
