    "text": "Not a very elegant solution, but I was using an infinite loader and ended up looping through tag pages with ajax.\n\nWhen you load the tags on the page you can return how many posts have that tag, If you choose multiple tags, I find the tag with the least posts, then get all the posts from that tag that have all the tags iâ€™m looking for (looping through the pages with ajax requests)\n\nI would send you a snippet but my code is super messy, as the posts load in all sorts of different widths, heights and formats in differing patterns, and the client kept changing their mind how they wanted them"
