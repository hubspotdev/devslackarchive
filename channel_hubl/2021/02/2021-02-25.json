Which is the hubl comment tag.\n\nSo a large chunk of the plugin Im using was missing after HubSpot does it's compression.\n\nIs there a way to stop this from happening?\n\nfor the mean time I've had to upload the JS to the file manager however I would much rather have it with the rest of my JS files.\n\nSee the screenshots attached",
