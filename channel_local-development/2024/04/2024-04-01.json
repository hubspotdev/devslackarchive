    "text": "Hi team, so straight to the point im a freelancer looking to use HubSpot, before I dedicate time on it im curious is it possible:\n\n`Create a page on HubSpot, where the user can customise a 3D model of a car, when they select from a list of car parts it should visually update the part on the 3D model of the car. There are a lot of car companies that do this,`\n\nIs this possible to do on HubSpot? My initial impression of HubSpot is that its really great for creating static content and then swopping it out with variables, classic CMS tool :slightly_smiling_face:  but this seems something a little more complex for HubSpot to handle. Any information would be greatly appreciated :pray:",

And this is assuming you already have working 3d models that you can load into the viewer... On the whole, a lot of work.\n\nBut yes, it can be developed as a HubSpot module."
