    "text": "Hi community, maybe someone has found out a solution for this. In HubSpot when you insert a form field in a landing page the form module gives you three options: 1-The chance to choose one or several mails to send the converted form 2- The chance to include it in a workflow 3- The chance to choose a follow up email.\nThe issue begins when you use a form field within a Custome Module\nthen the form options disapear\nwe have managed to figure out how to get them back by adding Hubl code into the CM \nWe have found out the hubl code for adding the option for follow up email and workflow but we don't get to the code needed for getting notification email option.                                              This is the code working for follow up option\nsimple_email_for_live_id=\"{{ module.followupemail_field }}\"\n form_follow_ups_follow_up_type=\"simple\"\nThis one for workflows options\nform_follow_ups_workflow_id = {{ module.workflow_field }}\nand this is what we have tried for emailnotifications but in this case is not working\nnotifications_are_overridden=True\n          notifications_override_email_addresses =[{{ module.email_field }} (edited)\n                                                              We have managed to include emails for notification with\nnotifications_are_overridden=True\n         notifications_override_email_addresses =[\"<mailto:jedwar@inboundemotion.com|jedwar@inboundemotion.com>\", \"<mailto:jnavarrete@inboundemotion.com|jnavarrete@inboundemotion.com>\"]\n\nbut this means you have to code in the module every mail you want to send notification, the option does not appear in the settings for the user to easyly add emails.\n\nanyone has find themselves in the same issue? Any ideas from HubSpotters?"
