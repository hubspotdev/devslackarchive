But then when they start messaging us from that ad, HubSpot inbox picks up the conversation and creates a new contact with the same name but no attribution, this contact though has the inbox history.\nSo we end up with 2 contacts, and half the information we want on each contact.\n\nI am considering creating an ops custom code workflow that combines the two contacts if they have the same name and are created within a few minutes of eachother but this solution is a bit clunky, and not ideal as we could get 2 people messaging with the same name (not common, but again not ideal)"
