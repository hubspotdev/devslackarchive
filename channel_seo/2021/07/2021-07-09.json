    "text": "I recommend to review relevancy: if the inbound link is irrelevant, and from foreign TLD, it is worth considering scrapping it.\n\nAnd also bearing in mind, that if the domain authority of the link is low, the less impact it has anyway. Better to keep cleaner link profile with higher domain authorities and commonly used TLDs. Also depends on how significant part of your total links comes from these, the smaller the portion is, less impact it has on your overall profile."
