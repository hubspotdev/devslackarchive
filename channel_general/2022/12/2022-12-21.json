    "text": "Hello, I am new to this slack thread and to HubSpot so my apologies if I ask silly questions.\n\nI am trying to write an integration to HubSpot in which I retrieve all the contacts associated with one company.  I am using this endpoint: \"<https://api.hubapi.com/companies/{id}/contacts>\" which is returning several contacts correctly.  However the contacts returned are all IsPrimary on this company.  Is there a way to get all contacts associated with the company, whether or not they are primary?\n\nMany thanks."
