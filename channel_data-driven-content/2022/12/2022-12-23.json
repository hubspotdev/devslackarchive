    "text": "<@U02LZ5XBSH2> There are two interesting Beta's which you can look into: <https://app.HubSpot.com/whats-new/20114339/by-tool/crm?productUpdateId=13868243|[Live] Configure associations when a record is created> and <https://app.HubSpot.com/whats-new/20114339/by-tool/crm?productUpdateId=13866354|[Public Beta] Customize 'Create record' form by pipeline (Pro+ needed)>. With these you should be able to specify a field of association to your ticket, and better yet limit it to a pipeline (perhaps called customer portal?).\n\nYou won't be able to filter form fields using HubSpot forms, in general there are a couple of options to deal with it:\n• Use dependent form fields if you have a limited set of custom object types which can be associated with companies, and only show the individual fields if an appropriate field is selected: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/forms/use-dependent-form-fields|see dependant form fields.> \n• Write an HTML/Hubl module to create an HTML form you submit via a server-less function. <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/Show-second-filter-result-based-on-selection-of-first-filter/m-p/547836|Bare in mind Hubl is server side templating, filtering would need to be done with Javascript in this case.> "
