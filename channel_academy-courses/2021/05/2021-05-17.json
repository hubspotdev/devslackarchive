    "text": "Just posting this here for those asking about the CMS Dev Certification on the Academy as we’ve had a couple of questions on this come in: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/blog/cms-for-developers-course-update>\n\n&gt; In the spring of 2020, HubSpot launched some major new CMS features including themes, drag and drop editing in the page editor, and a new local development workflow with a command line interface for quickly creating assets and syncing with production and sandbox CMS accounts. An Academy quickstart lesson on these features was launched concurrently and many folks have used it alongside the documentation to get familiar with these exciting features.\n&gt; \n&gt; The time has now come to transition this certification to represent the new way of working with the CMS. Unfortunately it’s not quite ready yet, but we know what it will cover and what the new practicum will look like. During this transition period we will be temporarily deprecating the CMS for Developers certification. *This means we won’t be awarding certifications for CMS developers until the new course is launched in summer 2021.*",
