I'm one of those megalomaniac who integrate everything - trust me when I said EVERYTHING. Anyway I'm here to test and feedback HB Beta, and also available to who need some help, mainly with external custom integrations, using PHP, Composer, CLI, JS, APIs... WordPress, Twilio, GA4, SendGrid, Drive.. just name an service and I probably had done. Well that's my introduction, hope make some friends on the way. :heart:",

Ask in a public channel instead of 1:1 DMs to help as many folks as possible. \n• Thread all replies to keep topics organized and searchable\n• Thread followup questions/comments to your original post\n• Don't post the same question in multiple channels. If you must, link to your original question in new channels.\nMore <https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack|great tips here>. Thanks for making the HubSpot Developer Slack easier to use for everyone!",
