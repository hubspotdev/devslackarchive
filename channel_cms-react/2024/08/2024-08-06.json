I'm new here, for some context: I'm struggling to set up a new react based cms for my company based on dynamic components that can insert into DnD templates and edit the content of them from the HS edit pages.\nI'm doing some tests and I'm encountering problems to make some libraries like swiper or react-slick work, but I'm not able to make them work, I guess it has something to do with the environment is a SSR, is this correct? is there any way to make this kind of libraries work?\nBest regards and thanks for your time!",

Not only the Icon comp will stop working but every HS Component will stop working.\n\nIf itâ€™s just inside an (Island) element which is visible during page load, then it should work. Just remember to 10 times double check the fieldPath haha."
