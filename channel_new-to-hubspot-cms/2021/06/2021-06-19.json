But since the font don't change that often I'll describe the easiest/quickest one.\n\n• upload your custom font to the design-manager\n• open the theme-override.css(if you working with the boilerplate) or your main css file(if you go the \"one css file to rule them all\" way\n• implement the fonts with @font-face \n• write your h1-h6, font stylings as you  need\nDone"
