    "text": "Hello there, Friends. Today I have a small issue regarding the menu module. I have 2-level module I created - with parent and child classes. I use this module in both navigation and footer of my website, but it seems the whole menu is being treated as one class in HTML / HUBDB / CSS. I wanted to make the parent class bold but I cannot do so - the whole menu turns bold instead. Have you got the same experiences? Does anyone have a hint on how to solve this? Thank you in advance."
