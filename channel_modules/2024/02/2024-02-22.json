    "text": "I've been working on a custom proposal template using the default one with the flow theme. The design manager seems to be working for me and I'm able to use the bult-in modules and other logic. All that said, I just realized that users will not be using the customization features each time they build a quote but instead will go through the \"Create\" flow. On the _Quote Details_ screen they only have the option of adding text in _Comments to buyer_ and _Purchase terms._ Is there no way to include my user prompts, image uploads and other customizations that I setup? It looks like they would have to Edit the Quote template for each new quote to add the relevant custom data specific to that quote and that wasn't the intent."
