    "text": "Hey everyone! We're looking to hire a full-stack developer for Sendspark (<http://sendspark.com|sendspark.com>). Our stack is JavaScript / React / MongoDB / NodeJS / Nest. We have a HubSpot app, and building out our integration with HubSpot's API will be a big part of the job (but not all of it!).\n\nWe are remote, but most of our dev team is based in LatAm and we do bi-annual off-sites, so would give preference to LatAm residents.\n\nShould me a DM with your LinkedIn resume if you're interested!",
