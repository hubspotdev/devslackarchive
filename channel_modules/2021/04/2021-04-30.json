    "text": "Hey <#CFPRTEGTX|modules> group,\n\nPremise of problem:\nMy company has rebate programs that users fill out on the company website, which allows the user to fill in an input field (custom module), then choose how they would like to receive their rebate (form conditional). Based on that rebate selection, the correct form will then appear for the user to fill out their info, attach an invoice,  then submit.\n\nWhen the marketing designer creates the rebate page in HS design manager, the designer can choose whether there is an input field present on the page or not (custom module selected for design).\n\nPROBLEM:\nUsers are skipping the input field portion. This is a problem for the marketing department (long story). Is there a way (JS portion of custom module) to have a function check:\n\nIF input is present (it is not always needed on a rebate page) AND the input field is empty, to then disable the \"submit\" and pop-up a red notice for the input field portion to notify the user why they CANNOT \"submit\"?\n\nEssentially making the input field required when that module is present... TLDR\n\nThank you",
