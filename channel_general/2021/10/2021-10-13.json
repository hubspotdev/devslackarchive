If I trigger for 10 clients, is a single file generated with all these contacts, or 1 for each totaling 10 files?\n2. If it's a single file, can I get HubSpot to download an example to check the format? If not, can you send me one? 3. If a single file is generated, there is some limit on the number of contacts, that is,\n3. if you reach this limit, is a second file generated with the rest of the contacts? Thanks",

I feel like custom coding DND areas is really the slowest part of the entire HubSpot dev process. Ive found it much faster to provide blank templates and build “templates” by just dragging modules around on the page and having clients clone those pages instead of always building them actual templates with the content and modules baked in. But if I could build the page out in the page editor and then generate hubl markup for that specific DND section or DND Area that would be pretty darn dope."
