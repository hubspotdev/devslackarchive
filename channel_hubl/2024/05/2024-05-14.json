    "text": "Hi community, I'd like to tell you about a rather unusual problem. It involves a page built with Hubl, featuring dynamic content. Everything was fine for years. The page has been online for, well, years and worked perfectly. That is, until yesterday.\n\nStarting yesterday, something odd began happening. The HTML being rendered is incorrect and behaving strangely. After thoroughly checking everything, I concluded it had nothing to do with the code itself. The code is the same as it's always been.\n\nThen I discovered something surprising. I raised a ticket with HubSpot but haven't received a response yet.\n\n1/ When I view the page in preview mode, it looks perfect and works fine. However, the published page looks wrong.\n\n2/ If I add the flag 'hsDebug=true' to the URL of the problematic page, it starts displaying correctly again.\n\nThis makes me think there's something cached (stored) in some way that's causing the incorrect display of the page's content. To me, it seems like HS might have cached something related to the Hubl code processing. It's very strange.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? Can anyone share some insights or tips on how to solve this?",
