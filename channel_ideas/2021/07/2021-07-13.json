    "text": "It’d be great if the select + multi-select fields in HubDB had both a “pretty” name and a value. For example *Agriculture Farming* would be the “pretty” name and *agriculture_farming* would be the value. Or *Oil, Gas, &amp; Energy* would be the “pretty” name and *oil_gas_energy* would be the value. I often use these fields for filtering via a custom module and the pretty names make it a pain. ACF in WordPress does a really good job of this offering both a pretty and value as a return format.",
