I’m working with a child theme and need to add some additional paragraph styles (i.e paragraph large, paragraph small) to the style dropdown in the rich text editor. Is the only way to do this to to create a custom rich text module? Or has anyone come across another solution for this? Any help is most appreciated. Cheers :slightly_smiling_face:",
