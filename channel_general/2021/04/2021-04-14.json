We did all the testing and took it live last night. But now this form is not collecting/recording any new data. And it says this error below,\n\n\"Contacts are limited to 1,000 form submissions. As the contact has reached this limit, their submission won’t show up on their contact record and they won't be enrolled in workflows based on this form.\"\n\nWe have already deleted the test contact records from Contact Database. but still shows this error.,\n\nAny help?"

I have made some technical perfromance gains by changing some simple things-- file sizes, JS blocking, etc. I ran our \"Google Page Insights\" Mobile results-- we're seeing an improvement from 24 to 79 in one day. I believe with a few more days I can leverage a higher number.\n\nI think the logical fallacy my team is making here is making here is relying too much on Google's site speed metrics as an end all be all solution for SEO performance. I certainly think the HubSpot ecosystem is generally more secure than Wordpress at large.\n\nThank you for your insight-- I'm an at an impass w/ my team here and am trying to keep everyone calm and collected as I try to keep us on HubSpot."
