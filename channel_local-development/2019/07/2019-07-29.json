    "text": "Update on our gulp build in case this helps anyone... the `hscms watch` command syncs _all_ local files to the DM on start, which is a bit problematic when there are multiple people working on the same dev portal.  Instead, I updated my gulp task to use `gulp-cached` to essentially take a snapshot of the `dist` folder on start.  When a file in the `src` folder is changed, it builds to `dist`, uses the cache to determine which files have changed in the `dist` and streams those a `sync` folder, and executes the HubSpot `hscms sync` command targeting that folder. Thus, only files that have been modified while the gulp task is running get synced."
