However, I don’t have precise information on how long it might take to be listed there.\nMeanwhile, there are two options we may offer.\nFirst, we share a HubSpot test account with you (full access) to try out the solution in a safe environment.\nSecond, we may tailor the push notifications solution specifically for your case and install it on your server (e.g. firebase).\n\nWhich one is better for you?"
