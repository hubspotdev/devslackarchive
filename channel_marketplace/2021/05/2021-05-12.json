We plan to upload our free *version, paid HubSpot theme, in the upcoming months.\n\n1) How long does it take to receive the first response from the reviewer team.\n\n2) How long does it take to receive the response after resubmitting.\n\n3) Is there any difference in the reviewing process for free and paid themes?\n\nIf there any other challenges with reviewing process, please share your experience.\n\nPaul",
