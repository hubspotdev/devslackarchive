    "text": "Hey Dewayne, just following up here, the underlying issue was resolved!\n\nContext - If\n```request.contact.contact_vid```\nevaluated to a null value (shouldn't happen when someone is actually logged in to view private content), they'd see the info for the lowest (numerical) VID (Contact ID).\n\nNow it will correctly be a null value and show no data.\n\nWe'd also recommend wrapping any contact specific data in a conditional (if/else logic) that checks to ensure someone is actually logged in. Some example code can be found here: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/data/memberships#crm-object-hubl-functions>\n\nSpecifically we recommend wrapping your  contact data in this\n```{% if request_contact.is_logged_in %}\n&lt;!-- contact data to displayed if logged in --&gt;\n{% else %}\n&lt;!-- What to display if no one is logged in --&gt;\n{% endif %}```"
