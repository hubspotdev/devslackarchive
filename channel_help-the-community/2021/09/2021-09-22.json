The redirect URL should be the same as available in your App Auth settings.\n• Execute the prepared Authorization URL, and it will ask to authorize the required things from the HubSpot account.\n• Once approved, you will receive an authentication code to your redirect URL.\n• Use the received code to create HubSpot Access &amp; Refresh Token.\nI hope this helps."
