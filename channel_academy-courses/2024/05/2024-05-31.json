I am trying to complete the HubSpot CMS for Developers II: Best Practices but it says I have to use the practicum I completed for HubSpot CMS for Developers as a starting point.\n\nWell jokes on you if you don't do it within the 90 days. If you're inactive on the sandbox account for 90 days all of that gets deleted.. so I have nothing to start with. What a joke.",
