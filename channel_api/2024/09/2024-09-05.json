I’ve been exploring HubSpot's SMTP and Transactional Email API for this purpose, but it seems like I need to purchase the Transactional Email add-on to use the feature.\nIs there any way for developers to test this for free, or are there any alternatives within HubSpot that I can use for tracking emails during the development phase?"

    "text": "Hey <@U042D0K7H27>, yes this is definitely possible. You’d want to make a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/guides/apps/private-apps/overview|private app> if you haven’t already — this gives you an access token you can use to authenticate API calls.\n\nThese API calls could be sent from a <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/api/automation/custom-code-actions|custom coded workflow action> (programmable automation) or some external system, but either way you’d want to send them to the DELETE endpoint for the object that you want to delete. Here’s the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/api/crm/objects/contacts#delete-%2Fcrm%2Fv3%2Fobjects%2Fcontacts%2F%7Bcontactid%7D|endpoint for contacts>, which you can test on that page using your access token.\n\nFrom there, you just need the ID of the record you want to delete, and that’s easy to get in a workflow. Hope that helps!"
