    "text": "Hi! I'm new to HubSpot and trying to get an understanding of the migration process. I have a client who recently migrated their website to HubSpot. Their domain registrar is Enom, and their site was hosted through A2 Hosting. They've still been paying for hosting through A2 Hosting even though they've migrated over, and their nameservers are still pointed to A2 Hosting. Should they have changed their nameservers when they migrated to HubSpot?",
