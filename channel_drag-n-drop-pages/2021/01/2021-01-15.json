    "text": "I’ve probably asked this before but 3rd time’s a charm right?  I have a coded template with DND_areas.  User goes in and uses said template, adds modules and what not, creates two columns inside a section both with some content.  But the columns are vertically aligned center and one column is taller than the other so they want them aligned flex-start.  How can they adjust this?  (I can’t change the dnd_column alignment in the code because that will not affect an already created page). Is there no way inside the page itself to change the alignment of a column?",

Our company is just in the planning stages of developing new blog templates, and I wanted to see if there has been any intention by HubSpot to integrate drag and drop area support into blog templates in the future?
