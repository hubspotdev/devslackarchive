Regardless however email analytics on all platforms are slightly skewed, because some email clients cache the images, such as Gmail.\n\n<https://help.litmus.com/article/166-how-are-gmail-opens-reported-within-email-analytics>"

HubSpot lists \"Chrome\" as an email client in our email analytics, but we don't have a web version link so I have no idea what that really means. Is it Yahoo in Chrome? Gmail? AOL? etc."

We've spent quite a lot of time optimising the code output from the drag and drop email editor so that it's highly responsive on mobiles, and cross-client compatible so we'd love to patch up any issues you've seen there to make it more resilient. The \"classic\" email editor defimnitely has issues, which is why we're stepping away from it over time, but the DnD editor should be _fairly_ bullet proof"
