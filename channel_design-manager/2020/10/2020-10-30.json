    "text": "Hey all, new here and new to designing and developing for HubSpot.\n\nI haven't coded consistently for years, but my latest role has me dusting off these atrophied skills. And with the help of Webflow, I'm spinning these things up pretty quickly. Biggest challenge I'm having is this:\n\nI've created all of my files in HubSpot (page.html, css folder with my css files, js folder with my js file) and copied all of my code into the DM. But once I preview it, none of the CSS is rendering. It renders fine locally, but it doesn't work in HubSpot. I made sure the paths are correct, but when I view source in the preview, it doesn't even show the links to the CSS.\n\nSo, I'm out of ideas, and if this isn't the right place to ask this, please direct me so I'm not clogging up the channel with my issues :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThanks in advance!",
