I’m running into a little situation and I’m hoping if anyone here can help me out / give me some suggestions.\n\nBecause we’re using non-HubSpot forms, we are no longer able to get “original source” for all our free trial contacts and from what i’m hearing, this is what’s supposed to happen. How our system is currently set up is that when a lead fills out a form on our website, that information will first go to our portal system and then send the same information over to HubSpot via API.\n\nWithout changing the API pathway from portal to HubSpot, is there still a way to capture the original source?\n\n_*note: I’m not a developer, just a marketer who really needs original source*_\n\nThank you!"
