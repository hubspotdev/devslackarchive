So your flow would be:\n1 - User/Contributor writes post then clicks submit for approval\n2 - Editor makes their edits/spellchecks/grammar and so on, then either publishes it or saves it and notifies user/contributor to make additional edits.\n\nCould probably do step 2 as:  If editor dissapproves, then you get a modal with a place to send a message to the user/contributor for updates to make and then they can resubmit after making changes"
