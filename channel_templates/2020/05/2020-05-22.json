You can see it here: <https://connect.fairbanksurology.com/?hs_preview=vbmNcyHc-29649132740>\n\nI'm looking to email results to the user taking the survey. An email does send after completing the survey, but I'm looking to average the submissions and give a \"score\" based on the user's selections.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions regarding how I might do this?"
