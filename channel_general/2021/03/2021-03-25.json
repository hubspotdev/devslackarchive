When this `{ async: true }` is present it jacks up the CMS.\n\nWhen attempting to drag in new module, they won't immediately render in the editor view but will show up in the CONTENTS tab.  I'm unable to delete a module in the editor view, only the CONTENTS TAB.\n\nAs a test, the main-foot.css file referenced in the screenshot below is empty. Nothing it in at all. Yet as soon as I add ASYNC the CMS goes wonky.\n\nAnyone else used ASYNC with CSS and had success?\n\nCC: <@U7SL518D6>",
