    "text": "Is there a way to access Global Module content outside of Design Tools? For instance, I want some editable content on a blog index page, but that type of template doesn't support the drag and drop CMS. I figured using a global module, then inserting the global module in the blog index would do the trick, however, it's not intuitive to access this content from the design tools when everything else is editable from the CMS. Of course, open to other suggestions to solve this problem.",
