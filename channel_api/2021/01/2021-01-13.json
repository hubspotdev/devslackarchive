    "text": "hi everyone, in our company we're working a lot with objects from HubSpot, in particular companies and deals - e.g. we use them to check integrity (making sure our commercial people didn't break anything), to keep our platform up-to-date etc. For that we need to fetch all the companies and deals every day. We're currently doing it via API endpoints `/deals/v1/deal/paged` and `companies/v2/companies/paged`. I'm aware that these are now outdated and e.g. for companies there now is `/crm/v3/objects/companies` :HubSpotheart: However, before I migrate our infrastructure onto the new endpoint, I wonder - isn't there a more efficient way to fetch all companies and deals? The one way I know about is manual CSV export, but that's manual, so clearly not useful for our automated solution. Thanks a lot in advance!"

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe are using the object API endpoint : `<https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search>` to retrieve an existing user by email.\n\nWe do that by adding a filterGroup to the payload as such\n\n```filterGroups: [\n    {\n        filters: [\n            {\n                operator: 'EQ',\n                propertyName: 'email',\n                value: email,\n            },\n        ],\n    },\n],```\nthis seems to only work for the primary email. If a user has a second or third (or subsequent) email, it won't be match to the query resulting in a user not found, which leads to a bug as we're trying to create a new user with this existing email.\n\nIs there anyway to include other emails in the filters params that we send along the way to the search endpoint ?",
