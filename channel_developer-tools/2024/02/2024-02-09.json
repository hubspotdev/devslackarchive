I'm using a video module for both desktop and mobile. I have four sections total, two visible for desktop and the other two visible for mobile. I duplicated and edited one of the video background modules to try to adjust the height allowance to fix my problem, but this hasn't fixed anything. Any suggestions? See the screenshots:",
