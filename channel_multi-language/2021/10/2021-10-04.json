    "text": "*Sorting with Umlaut.* `Ä, Ö, Ü, ä, ö, ü.`\n\nNeed sorting Feature for HubL that doesn't append Umlaut character at the end of the response object.\nWould be perfect if the Umlaut character position is handled alphabetized like `Ae, Oe, Ue, ae, oe, ue,` but would be also okay if it's just prepend or append to its base character value: `A, Ä, B, C` etc.\n\nRelated to HubL Filter:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/filters#sort>\n\nAnd HubDB Queries:\n<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/hubdb/v2/get_table_rows>\n\nThanks for any advice to do that!\nOr maybe as a Feature for future filter optimizations?",

    "text": "By the way there is a *problem with character URL encoding* in HubDB Queries. If Strings are not encoded in the Database, they don't match, example: \"Costa Rica\" (DB) == \"Costa%20Rica\" (Filter). The result is `false`, but should be `true`. Something encodes the parameters for the request, but not decode it when it comes to the expression test for the database field values."
