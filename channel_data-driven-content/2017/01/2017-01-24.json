    "text": "Hey everyone, Does anyone have a minute to help me out with a piece of code? I'm trying to implement a real estate listing page with hubdb. As part of the requirements I need to be able to filter the results, I am trying to filter the results by using a query string. I'm not sure what I'm missing, I am trying to use the button to post the querystring and then pull only the results that match that querystring, if there is no querystring, all results should show. It works with no querystring, and the querystring is being posted, but my code isn't executing the modified table. This is what I have:"
