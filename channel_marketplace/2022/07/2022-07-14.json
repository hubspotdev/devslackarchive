    "text": "Hi! I am not sure this is the right channel, but we've been having issues where duplicate companies are being created when someone purchases from the marketplace. When the purchaser's contact record is created, the company is created because we have that setting on in general in our portal. But there is also something else hidden related to the marketplace, maybe when the purchase is APId over to create a deal, that also creates a company at the same time. It's only been going on a month or so, unless I didn't notice the trend and was just cleaning up duplicates before that without knowing why.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this or know how to turn that off, the specific marketplace setting that creates a duplicate company for each purchase?",
