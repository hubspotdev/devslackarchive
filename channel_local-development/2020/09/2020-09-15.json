Unfortunately if an ad blocker starts blocking your CTA the best thing to do is report it to the ad blocker.\n\nIf you’re using CTAs properly they shouldn’t be getting flagged in the first place. They would be going to landing pages in your own content. They wouldn’t “feel” like an ad.\n\nAd blockers usually block the JavaScript that makes an ad function,  So that significantly limits what HubSpot can do to work around the issue."
