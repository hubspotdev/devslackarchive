We can do it but it seems heavy handed versus a clone_object API call. <@U01QVR44MEY> you haven’t come across any undocumented cloning calls in your travels?"

We offer the ability for people to use calculators and whenever they click submit, we set up a couple properties like total price. Estimated number of people, like those form fields were using JavaScript to bring those form fields into our custom properties inside the event. those I had to create when I created the event, so those are the custom properties. does that help? apologies "
