You wouldn't be able to change it on the LP Form Module itself (for example having it be \"Submit\" on the forms portion and then changing it to be \"Booyah\" on the LP). Only way to do it is to use JS sadly... I would add this to the ideas forum and then post a link back here of the submission so we can upvote it."
