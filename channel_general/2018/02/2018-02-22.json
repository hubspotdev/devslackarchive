Don't have h1 inside of h2's, don't have h3's if you don't have h1 and h2 already, etc.  remember WAVE is not 100%. The only way to have your site verified is by a manual audit.  At least here in the US, there are no official certification or anything. If you get sued, then it's just a matter of having a professional review your site and present the findings to the judge. In a case we're going through right now with Department of Education, there's a lawyer assigned to our case that has a team literally use the site as non-sighted or impaired users and then they decide if it's usable or not."
