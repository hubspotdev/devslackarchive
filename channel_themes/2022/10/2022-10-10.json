My plan is to create (or modify 1 existing theme) with only the required number of template files with proper naming conventions and dynamic modules.\n\n*My question is:* Is there a way to search for which templates are being used and by which landing page/blog post? Or is there a way to export a CVS with a list of page/post names and the template files being used?\n\n<@U02UEA28Z9B> <@U02U98D9L07> Would you happen to know if there’s a better way?",
