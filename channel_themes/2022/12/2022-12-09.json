The simplest would probably be to use <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/filters#random|HubL’s built-in >`random`<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/filters#random| filter>:\n```{% for post in recent_posts | random %}\n    &lt;div class=\"blog-post\"&gt;{# ... #}&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}```\nIf — for some reason — this doesn’t give you the results you’re looking for, you could also loop your post objects into an array, then use whatever scrambling/un-sorting logic you’d like to disorder the array:\n```{% set post_array = [] %}\n\n{# Fill the array with recent posts #}\n{% for post in recent_posts %}\n    {% do post_array.append(post) %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n{# Pass the array into a macro or function of your creation #}\n{% do your_macro(post_array) %}```\nI hope this helps!"
