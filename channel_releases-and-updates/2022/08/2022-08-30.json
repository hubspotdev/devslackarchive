You used to be able to, while difficult, if you dragged it to the correct pixel, it would show the border indicator you needed and work, but lately I don't seem to be able to at all. I don't know if I just forgot the trick with it or what."

    "text": "Ok cool, that's helpful! Yeah, we've definitely talked about doing a multi select situation so you have more control about where your containers go. The thing we typically get stuck on is allowing multi select in just modules that _could_ actually be a row. So like, do we let you multi select modules in random parts of the page and group them into a container? Or is there a pattern we can use to only multi-select modules that are naturally in a row? So just taking the time to figure that out. I don't think we'll have the bandwidth to address it this year, but hoping it's something we can figure out next year."

This used to work and was very finicky, but I haven't been able to create a row in several months."
