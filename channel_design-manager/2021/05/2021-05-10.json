For anyone else who was wondering, if you simply define a maximum width on *\".dnd-section &gt; .row-fluid\"* in your stylesheet*,* then by default, all of your content will restricted to that width. However if you click on \"Center content\" and define a new maximum width (by default it will be the value you set in the stylesheet) or click on \"Full width\", the default maximum width you set will be overridden."
