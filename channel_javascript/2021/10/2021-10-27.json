    "text": "Hey everone, one of my customer noticed when they're creating forms in their developer account that a new line called _region:_ has been added to the embed code.\nPreviously created forms in the live version did not show this, however this new line appears as _region: „na1“_ in the live version and as _region:„eu1“_ in the developer test portal. (see screenshot)\n\nIf the line \"region\" is completely left out, the form is still correctly integrated and displayed.  If the value is changed, e.g. na1 to eu1, the form is not loaded. In addition, the JavaScript src URL is also different.\n\nBackground:\nThe customer  created new forms in their CMS backend only with the portal and form ID. (Editors are not allowed to embed HTML embedding codes). During a test today, this led to the above mentioned situation.\n\nThe ustomers suggested workaround would be to omit the region line by default and enter it if the region is \"eu1\". (Extension of our CMS element to include the line \"region\" as an optional field). Another solution would probably result in our previous forms not being loaded in the live system.\nDoes someone know, where this region line is coming from and what it's supposed for?",
