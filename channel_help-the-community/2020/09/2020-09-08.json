    "text": "I am not sure where to put this but I have an issue with the Vidyard embedded videos. I have a form with an inline thank you message where I want to embed a video. If I use an \"external video\" (like a Youtube video) when someone converts, the video gets loaded in the inline thank you page asynchronously. On the other hand, if I use an \"internal video\" (via the Vidyard integration and the hubl tag `video_player`), when someone converts, instead of loading the video in the inline thank you message asynchronously, it reloads the complete page to be able to load the video :see_no_evil:.  Is there a way to avoid an additional request and have the Vidyard videos load asynchronously?"
