    "text": "Thank you all for the insights.\n\nI deduced that, because the HubSpot form was made with react, moving the fields around messed up with the way the react script is checking if the fields are filled or not.\n\nUsing multiple forms with a hidden email field wasn't appealing so my solution was to clone the form fields and create a custom form through javascript with them. To separate the steps I made a convention to use header sections (Hackish way but at least my multiple steps form stays in 1 form :man-shrugging: ). To submit it to HubSpot I used the HubSpot form submit api tutorial.\n\nAgain thanks for your help."
