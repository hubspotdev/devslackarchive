    "text": "hi <@U25PYL3Q8> thanks for the response. Yeah, I've tried boiling it down to basics (simple CSV, importing only one row, tried importing 2 rows as well just in case it was an odd thing where it didn't like me importing just one single row lol), but I haven't tried adding through the HubSpot UI, exporting, and then using that. I've also not tried curl so I'll give both of those a go and see if I get any different results.\n\nhowever, I did try using the PHP API client for another endpoint which returned me an authentication error saying my key didn't have the correct scope, so I would assume the issue I am having is not authentication based, but again, I'll try removing the scope to make sure I get an auth error, just as another step in the process"

How has it gone and/or what do you recommend from your experience?\n\nHow about for anyone (or everyone) else?\n\n@HubSpot, can you please make the distinction between a sandbox and a dev test env clearer?  Or, given the deadline of sunsetting HAPI keys, please specify which env is best or AT LEAST clear considerations as to the trade-offs between the two options?

    "text": "@channel/anyone, how has testing gone for the new Private App APIs?  Specifically, did you use a HS sandbox or a HS dev env?\n\nI'm just beginning this with my team and I'm staring down at the sandbox account with*out* 100% confidence as to which env is best to use.  Has your team started/finished testing in the sandbox or in a dev test env?  How has it gone and/or what do you recommend from your experience?\n\nWhat are your thoughts/suggestions?\n\n@HubSpot, given the deadline of sunsetting HAPI keys, please specify which env is best or AT LEAST clear considerations as to the trade-offs between the two test environments.  I've read everything in the migration documentation, Community, this channel, etc., and I'm going around in circles.  It's too much of a guess as it stands.\n\nThank you in advance for any feedback/advice from anyone.  #hsfolife #pushnpulln #help"

I was being cheeky and I should have gone back and been a bit more clear.\n\n<https://www.HubSpot.com/products/sandbox|Sandbox messaging from HubSpot>\n```- Update an existing sandbox by syncing it with your production account\n- Copy CMS assets, deal and ticket pipelines, custom object definitions, custom properties, and more to easily run tests\n- Experiment with integrations before adding them to your production account```\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/account-types|Development accounts from HubSpot>\n```Within app developer accounts, you can create developer test accounts to test apps and integrations without affecting any real HubSpot data.```\n<https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/account/set-up-a-HubSpot-standard-sandbox-account|Also in the Knowledge base that is linked from api key migration>\n```Super admins can create standard sandbox accounts to test functionalities without impacting your main HubSpot account. For example, you can connect an app to your standard sandbox account to test a new integration. By doing so, you can sync data from your main account to test the integration and keep the data in your main account clean.```\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/migrate-an-api-key-integration-to-a-private-app|API Key migration from HubSpot>\n```Follow the steps below to migrate an existing API key integration to a private app. It's recommended you first use a test environment, such as a developer test account or sandbox account, before making changes in production. If you have questions while migrating your app, visit the Developer Community. ```\nI don’t think HubSpot is opinionated in the way you can do work.  HubSpot is providing you tools that allow you to do things how you would like to do them.\n\nIf you want AN opinion, if you have a developer that is worth their chops, these take 30 seconds to do in production. But I’ve also tested out this since the accouncement was made across many different portals and integrations. I think it is best to work inside your team feels is comfortable doing."
