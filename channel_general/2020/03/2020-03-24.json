    "text": "I think this is a good use case for HubDB. In most content management systems this sort of stuff is handled as a ‘content type’ or a structure, which you can usually define fields for. So if i’m making a website for a dealer it’d be likely you’d want to setup a table for vehicles and include things like model, trim, price.\n\nNot sure if you’re aware HubDB supports dynamic pages which could be quite useful in this scenario: <https://designers.HubSpot.com/tutorials/building-dynamic-pages-with-hubdb>"
