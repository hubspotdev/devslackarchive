    "text": "Hey everybody, I'm the CEO of a french agency using HubSpot COS and GDD methodology. We've recently discovered 2 majors problems :\n\n1/ Since few weeks some of english URL appear in Google (like <http://www.ideagency.fr/brands-dissertations|www.ideagency.fr/brands-dissertations>) but we don't have english URL just french. So these english URL don't exist ! I contact HubSpot support and they tell me that all is OK. Is there anybody already met this kind of troubles ? Is it possible that I've been hacked with HubSpot COS ?? \n\n2/ Maybe it's linked... We suddenly loose are SEO because this morning only 1 TOP3 and 2 TOP10 appear in Keyword tools whereas I had more than 40 keywords in TOP3 and more than 100 in top 10 yesterday. All my keywords decrease by 100 and more... I don't have any error on Search Console. It's very strange. What's the matter ? I also contact the support and they tell me that all is OK...\n\nThanks so much for your help HubSpoters !"
