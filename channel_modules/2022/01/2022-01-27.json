We see though the module_id and are able to retrieve it with an extra call, yet what we receive is a long list of content (over 6000 lines for a small module). We were looking for a PATCH call to insert the translation into the right spot. Has anyone tried or knows of a PATCH method? We tested POST, but this is a bit too experimental in our case.\nThanks!"
