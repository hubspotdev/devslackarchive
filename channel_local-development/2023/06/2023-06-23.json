    "text": "Hi,\n\nI am new to the HubSpot CMS development.\nAnd I am about to start working on the website of a customer.\nAnd I am bit lost in terms of how to do it so that I do not overwrite existing content until customer says it is fine.\nThe customer wants an updated homepage. So I am thinking I will be working with the HubSpot CLI and downloading the existing theme.\n1. I will be creating a new template for the homepage (so that I do not overwrite the existing homepage template)\n2. I will created a stage draft of the homepage (so that I do not overwrite the existing one)\n3. I will attach the new template to the stage draft of the homepage. *Unfortunately this does not work and I have read that you cannot attach a new template or modified one to the existing page*\nSo I have been looking around and I do not understand what the best option is for working with existing content on live environments without overwriting the existing one until the customer says that is ok.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThanks",
