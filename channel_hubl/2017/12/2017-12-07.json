Though even after HubDB we probably still would have done this the same way because it allows us to give our clients a better editing experience than HubDB does. Though this specific site we built an off- HubSpot admin portal for managing all of those trucks via the HS API.  Allowing people to have access to edit the truck information without having access to HubSpot - also allowed us to meet the clients security and processing needs."
