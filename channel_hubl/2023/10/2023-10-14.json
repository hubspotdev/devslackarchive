    "text": "Yeah <@U04AQA0QM8E> I've realized that myself pretty quickly in the last days :sweat_smile:\n\nThe thing that bothers me is that even if the HS portal is set to Italian (as a language, as a locale for numbers/currency formatting ecc.) numbers are indeed displayed correctly in all of their instances across the portal (that is, a number with dot as thousands separator and comma as decimals separator as I desire, say a deal property \"offer_amount\" written as 1.234,56) but when I send an email with that property it is displayed as 1,234.56, as if it was printed assuming another locale format.\n\nBefore trying programmable emails (using {{ obj.prop }} notation) I also tested the traditional way with {{ personalization_token('obj.prop','default' }}, no difference.\nI don't know what else I could do. I mean, we're talking about a simple prop formatting!"
