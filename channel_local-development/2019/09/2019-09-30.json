It seems that HubL's `get_asset_url` requires a specific file as a parameter, so I'm unable to get the prefix right. Any ideas?",

All I want is to be able to use my existing React components. The only reason I use CRA is because I don't want to maintain my own build configs. I don't have time for that. So the ideal solution for me would be if HubSpot just took care of all that behind the scenes."
