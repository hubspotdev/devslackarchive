    "text": "Hello! :wave::skin-tone-3:\nI’m adding the HubSpot Conversations widget to our Angular app for <http://Touca.io|Touca.io>. We’d like to `load` and `open` the widget when a user clicks our custom “Send us a message” button and then `remove` that widget when user attempts to close the widget by clicking the HubSpot icon. I’ve implemented the first part (lmk if impl can be improved):\n```  openChatWidget() {\n    (window as any).HubSpotConversations?.widget.load();\n    (window as any).HubSpotConversations?.widget.open();\n  }```\nI’d like to ask for help to implement the second part. When should `remove` be called? What event should I listen to, to capture clicking the HubSpot icon when the widget is already open?",

    "text": "Hello Everyone,\nI want to send an email through a workflow, but i have 2 different links that i want to use randomly on my CTA. The CTA will redirect users to book a meeting with 2 sales persons, but i want to redirect the users to each URL associated to 1 of the sales person randomly. So that not all users land into one sales person, this way i can split audience targeting them randomly.\n\nIs there a way like to create 2 different versions, and have each URL set in one of them, and then trigger any of the emails randomly to users ?\n\nOr is there a HUBL function that enables me to generate the provided URLS randomly in the href=\"\" attribute ?",
