Gmail doesn't support attribute selectors at all and strips them out. Our solution has been to convert our templates to HTML and change all attribute selectors to standard classes and IDs. <https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/12_things_you_must_know_when_developing_for_gmail_and_gmail_mobile_apps>"

With both, we use zapier to ad submissions to HubSpot. Using Zapier we lose the original source information and contacts are added as \"Offline Sources.\" Any idea how we might resolve this?"
