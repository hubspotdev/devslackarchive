    "text": "Is there any way to unidentify or set a new identiy with the HubSpot tracking code? We're using the tracking code in a member area and it's setup to identify the user when they login, but short of revoking all cookies I can't figure out how to unset that identity.\n\nSo for example, user A logs in and I show them a CTA on page load. Then they logout. If i refresh the page it shows the CTA again. If I login with user B and refresh the page, the CTA shows again. There's gotta be some way to clear the identity right?\n\nThis is the code I currently run in our identify method (called on login & logout)\n\n```if (user.id) {\n      try {\n        const _hsq = (window._hsq = window._hsq || []);\n        _hsq.push([\"identify\", {email: user.email, id: user.id}]);\n      } catch (err) {\n        helpers.customSentryError(\"Unable to initialize HubSpot\", \"\", {\n          error: err,\n        });\n      }\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"remove HubSpot identity...\");\n      const _hsp = (window._hsp = window._hsp || []);\n      _hsp.push([\"revokeCookieConsent\"]);\n    }```"

I can confirm that this same code will still create a new contact if the email entered doesn't already exist, but it still creates the contact without the attached properties.\n\nHas something changed recently where I am now doing this wrong? or is something else going on where it won't work?"
