    "text": "Happy Thursday people - I have a question in regard to setting module default parameters within drag and drop coded templates.\n\n      `{% dnd_section %}`\n        `{% dnd_module path='/a8-theme-2021/modules/Partners Carousel.module',`\n\t\t\t\t\t`offset=0,`\n\t\t\t\t\t`width=12`\n         `%}`\n      `{% end_dnd_module %}`\n    `{% end_dnd_section %}`\n\nSorry for the weird spacing. Carried over oddly. What I’m trying to do is  set a default of 5 instances for a repeater image field I’ve set up. How would I go about doing this? in the docs, for dnd_modules, there doesn’t seem to be an option to add parameters.\n\nI found the below in the docs, but I’m struggling to adapt this to my current use case.\n```{% module path='../modules/recipe_card.module',\n  ingredients=[\"Eggs\",\"Ham\",\"Cheese\"]\n%}```\nAnyone willing to offer some guidance? Would really appreciate it.",
