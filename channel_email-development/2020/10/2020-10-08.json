I think there may be some things you have confused.\n\nYou absolutely can work on the design of the templates building them out how you want them and styling using CSS.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides#getting-started>\n\nThere are several tutorials here that can help you get familiar with the platform. If you’re working in VS Code, highly recommend reviewing the “creating an efficient development workflow” guide. Getting started with themes, and getting started with modules."
