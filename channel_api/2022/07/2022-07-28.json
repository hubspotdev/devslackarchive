No changes to the access token, no permission scope changes, etc.\n\nBased on my testing, I believe the name change only changes the name. But I thought I'd ask here since this isn't addressed in the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/private-apps|help docs> or in the descriptive text above the name change field (\"This name will appear in your private apps page, some HubSpot tools, and other material. It must be unique for this account.\")\n\nThanks!",
