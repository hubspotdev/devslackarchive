This means developers can focus more on the core of the module while also limiting content editors from accidentally breaking or misusing the modules for things other than their intended purposes.\n\nThese function similar to many WordPress plugins with the exception of you don’t always have to load the code for the module on every page on your site. Those who are familiar enough with HubL and its functions/filters can essentially recreate many of the most popular WordPress plugins out there. \n```"

They’re flexible like plugins, except they have none of the problems. Use the same libraries? no big deal it can be loaded just once. Need to add fields? no problem. Need to load it 100 times on the same page and worried about code duplication? No problem. Plugin UI problems?
