But if I try to do it via API, the cache isn't cleared and the page stays with empty boxes.\n\nEdit: I even tried to change a module used in all blog posts and push it to prod, the prerendered posts are still missing info\n\nAPIs used:\n `patch <https://api.hubapi.com/cms/v3/blogs/posts/{blog_post_id}>` with `state: 'PUBLISHED'`\nand `post <https://app.HubSpot.com/api/blogs/v3/blog-posts/#{blog_post_id}/publish-action>` with `action: \"schedule-publish\"`\n\nNote that I'm not close to the limit of hubdb calls per page.\n\nDid it happen to anyone else? Any idea to fix this?",

I'm having a hard time reproducing their open rate calck bc HubSpots open rate calc nets out bot opens from the open rate. Does anyone know where opens net of bots are stored in public API tables?"
