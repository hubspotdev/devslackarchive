    "text": ":wave: hello. We are using the LiveChat widget in our web application. We are using the event\n```on('conversationStarted',...)```\nto trigger an API action on our side to collect more information about the context around the request based on user identity, current page, account etc. _This part works fine._\n\nThe issue we are running into is that we would like to provide this information back to the Customer Care representative in the chat either by injecting the information into the chat itself or by attaching it the ticket created from the chat initiation. We are also open to other approaches to get this information back into HubSpot where it will be available to our customer care team.\n\nWhile we know we get a `conversationId` as part of the callback to this event we are having trouble using the HubSpot APIs to tie this conversation back to the ticket that was created as a result of the conversation being initiated or pass any messages into the chat programmatically based on conversationId.\n\nWe have not seen anything with webhooks, workflows, or associations that seems like it would help us with this problem.\n\nWe've reviewed the following docs in our research:\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/conversation/chat-widget-sdk>\n<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/conversations_api/HubSpot-conversations-javascript-api>\n<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/workflows/workflows_overview>\n<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/crm-associations/crm-associations-overview>\n\nAny help that could be provided would be greatly appreciated :thankyou:"
