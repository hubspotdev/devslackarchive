    "text": "`dnd_area` cannot be used within modules. Most of the time you’d want to do that repeatable fields or repeatable groups are really the better route.\n\nThat or you’ve made your module too broad, and it should serve a smaller purpose. Making modules that serve limited focuses makes it easier for content creators to mix and match modules together to create more layouts than you could accomodate for with “super modules”"
