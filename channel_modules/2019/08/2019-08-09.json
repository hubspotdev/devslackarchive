    "text": "Hello. I'm new in HubSpot. I cannot see for now if we can use modules for many sites. Saying we have a website A, B, and C. And a module Y. Can we use the Y module on websites A, B, C, or should we duplicate the Y module on each website? The question can be summarized as this: when we create several websites, are they all under the same HubSpot account (the service provider's one), or are there multiple accounts (in this case, a module can be shared by several accounts?)? Is there any link to documentation about this?",
