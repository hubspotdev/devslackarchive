Please view the details below.\n\nError(s) in module `@projects/.../app/components/modules/DownloadCard` \n*Module ID cannot be set in project modules```\nThis is the modules meta export (The typescript type is self made):\n```export const meta: ModuleMeta = {\n    module_id: 875187802698342,\n    label: 'Download Card',\n    icon: basecomLogo,\n    categories: ['design'],\n};```\nWe didn’t change anything about it recently.\nDoes anybody know what to do?",

The `module_id` is a generated value on our side, so we purposefully prevent devs from setting the `module_id` manually.\n\nIf you remove that, the builds should pass. If there is a reason you all need to explicitly set the `module_id`, I would be interested to know the details of your use case."

But when I'm on the same laptop at my brother's house I can also use `<http://hslocal.net:3000|hslocal.net:3000>` to proxy. So it's a router issue? Apartment vs. single family home. Weird huh?",
