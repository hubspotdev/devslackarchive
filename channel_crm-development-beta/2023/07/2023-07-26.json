    "text": "Hello everyone,\n<@U018962HD47> and I developed a custom CRM card with React, placed in the middle pane of the HubSpot UI, and it's working great.\nHowever, if we try to put it on the right sidebar, changing \"location\" from \"crm.record.tab\" to \"crm.record.sidebar\" in the example-card.json file, the card breaks.\n```{\n   \"type\": \"crm-card\",\n   \"data\": {\n      \"title\": \"Pizza React Exelab\",\n      \"location\": \"crm.record.sidebar\",\n      \"module\": {\n         \"file\": \"Example.jsx\"\n      },\n      \"objectTypes\": [{ \"name\": \"contacts\" }]\n   }\n}```\nWe thought it could be possible, since we tried it with a previous version (the one without React as shown in the docs) and it was working.\nAny hints about this behavior?",
