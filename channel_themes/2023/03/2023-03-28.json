    "text": "Hi Everyone, i am using the EduMind theme in my SandBox and at one moment the header was not visible anymore in the design manager and the code had an error that it misses modules. I find this weird behaviour because i am not supposed to be able to edit the template files? Anyone any idea about this. Thx! PS Attached a screenshot from the error it's in Dutch but i claims it misses modules with nummeric names. I also tried de-installing and installing the theme again but the issue persisted. I was also not able to remove the theme from my Marketplace downloads which is actually a seperate question i have because maybe installing and de-installing is not doing enough",
