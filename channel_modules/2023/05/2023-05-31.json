When I try to embed it or create a module to test this form displaying, it doesn't show anything when previewing the HubSpot CMS page I've added the code to. I'm wondering if I have to do something else e.g. like this info here about require.js &gt; <https://developers.HubSpot.com/blog/use-web-components-in-HubSpot-cms-development>\n\nThe code I am trying to test is:\n\n&lt;div id=\"homewise-calculator\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\nwindow.renderHomewiseCalculator({\ntargetSelector: '#homewise-calculator',\ntype: ' budget-booster-listing',\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIt also uses a URL reference which i understood should be in header:\n\n&lt;script src=\"<https://homewise.dabdev.net/js/homewise-calculator-widget.js>\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;",

    "text": "Hey all! I am looking in to the possibility of integrating our Shopify webshop with HubSpot to use HubSpots abandoned cart module to send e-mails when users in our webshop have left products in their cart. I already found out to use this module we need a Marketing Hub or Sales Hub Professional subscription. But before I subscribe to those, I want to know if this module/integration is technically possible when the frontend setup of our webshop is headless. I was wondering if any of you would happen to know this?",
