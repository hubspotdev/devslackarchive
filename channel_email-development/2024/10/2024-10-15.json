I have a custom contact mutli-line property in my form that I can use to pass URLs to the email, but if I pass HTML, the output in the email is text rather than rendered markup.",

It could be as simple as:\n\n```&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"<https://website.com/page_a>\"&gt;Page A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"<https://website.com/page_b>\"&gt;Page B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"<https://website.com/page_c>\"&gt;Page C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;```\nIn a multi-line property I can pass URLs that get automatically outputted as new lines. And in most email clients I would hope a URL gets automatically turned into a link. But it would be nice to be able send a list of links without exposing the URLs, because bare URLs aren't as user friendly as text URLs.\n\nRight now my users see:\n\n<https://website.com/page_a>\n<https://website.com/page_b>\n<https://website.com/page_c>\n\nAnd I would like them to see:\n\n• <https://website.com/page_a|Page A>\n• <https://website.com/page_b|Page B>\n• <https://website.com/page_c|Page C>"
