We messed around with the free trial last night and are going to be trying it out on a couple clients internally to see if it's something that will work for us. Along those lines, if anyone has any preferred tutorials or walkthroughs for configuring it for agency work, that would be much appreciated as well. We're following a few blog posts but still wrapping our heads around it"
