    "text": "Hi,\nis there any possibility to do an automatic redirect to the language version of a HubSpot page based on the users preferred language (similar to the way you can set up smart content by preferred language)?\nFor example, if a user not browses the exactly url of a page: <http://www.brematic.com/de|www.brematic.com/de> but only enters <http://www.brematic.com|www.brematic.com>, I want to have redirected the user to whatever his browsers (or IP based) language is ( German: <http://www.brematic.com/de|www.brematic.com/de> or English: <http://www.brematic.com/en|www.brematic.com/en> or French or whatever)"
