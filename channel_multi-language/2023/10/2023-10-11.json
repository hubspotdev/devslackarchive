Even after making a brand new account, the CLI always retrieved the old version.\n\nTo get the new version of the language switcher, I had to create a new account, use design tools to clone a copy of the new version, then fetch that copy. Not exactly the most elegant fix, but I hope it’s helpful for anyone who also runs into this issue."
