The timeline is a fixed/sticky element on the left that highlights the month as it goes to each grouping. I'm close to completing it, but I'm wondering if there is a better way to add in the fixed timeline... Any thoughts? I only need the month to appear once. (not listed with every post) When you use the default post filter module, you can list them by month but it's essentially just a link... I need it to actually show the posts next to the month in a grouping."
