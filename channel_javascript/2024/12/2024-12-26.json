    "text": "Hi everyone - I hope this is the right channel for this. With the V2 version of the forms you could edit a few things including the callback. With the new form editor with multi-step and conditional redirects, it appears that option has been removed from the embed code.\n\n```&lt;script src=\"<https://js-eu1.hsforms.net/forms/embed/145315646.js>\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"hs-form-frame\" data-region=\"eu1\" data-form-id=\"87ea34eb-5caa-4c3e-b1fc-012143abaa98\" data-portal-id=\"145315646\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;```\nvs the old\n\n```&lt;script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//js.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n    hbspt.forms.create( {\n        portalId: '145315646',\n        formId: '87ea34eb-5caa-4c3e-b1fc-012143abaa98',\n        region: 'eu1',\n        onFormReady: function($form) { }\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;```\nWill there be a way to modify the callback or onFormReady or the new forms editor?"
