    "text": "Hello everyone! I'm Vini , I'm a full stack developer and this is my first interaction here haha. I'm trying to use HubSpot live chat script in another application (Nextjs) and I want to load the chat in AMP pages. amp.dev says it's possible to run scripts in AMP pages by using amp-script tag but the documentation also says that we still won't be allowed to create another script tags with this script. Well, It seems that HubSpot live chat script tries to create a script tag and after the creation it tries to use parentNode (which can't be found so I receive an error message). So I wanna know if anyone knows how to use HB live chat script in a JS project for AMP pages. Is it possible?\n\n\nThank you very much for all the attention",
