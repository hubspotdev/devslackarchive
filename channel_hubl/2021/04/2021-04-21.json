    "text": "Hello,\n\nI have a table in the HubDB with a list of products.\nThe listing works very well and under the three languages, in this table I have labels in French, English, German to manage the translations.\n\nIn my code template, I can locate the language via the url and display the right fields for single product pages.\nHowever I have an SEO problem with the &lt;link rel=\"alternate\"&gt; specifying the wrong href. Obviously HubSpot doesn't understand that we have multiple languages for these pages and doesn't include the correct urls.\n\nDo you have a solution for this?\n\nThanks a lot :slightly_smiling_face:"
