But here I found one stopper, I need to add the `senderActorId` in the RQ body, I get it through the `conversations/v3/conversations/threads/{threadId}/messages` response. The problem is that the ID is of type visitor and when I try to send the message I get this error: `\"ActorType `VISITOR` is not supported for `sending`\"`.\n\nIn the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/conversations/conversations#get-actors|doc> I can see that the Visitor type may not be a contact yet.\n\nHere is my doubt: Did you know how can I manage these types of Ids? I mean, right now I have a Contact in HS but my actorId is of type Visitor, is there a simple way to manage this or am I missing something?"

That endpoint is only for posting _outbound_ messages (as a HubSpot 'agent' i.e. a user of your HubSpot account). That's mentioned right <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/conversations/conversations#send-messages-to-threads|here>, and it's making me want to clarify the overview portion of this same documentation to provide more clarity on what's possible today."
