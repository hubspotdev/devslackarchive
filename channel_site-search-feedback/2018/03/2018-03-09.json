    "text": "<@U25C65C3S> Really liking this search page.\n- Title tag should be overridable, I'll look into it\n- The issue with HubL for pulling in search results is now your page performance for search results is linked to how fast we can return that data. Ideally we would like to pull in search results async, which allows the search results page to be cacheable. Recently, we have moved rss feeds and post listings to be loaded async client-side on page load, which allowed these pages to be cached and didn't tie your page performance to how fast you could pull some external rss feed you didn't have control over. We found this increased page speed 50% on pages that used these modules. If we had a HubL search function, we would have do something similar, but then you get into the argument of why not just have an extendable CMv2 module anyways since that gives the developers complete control over the module. What would be a use case for a HubL function?\n-We were thinking about allowing you to specify the search path in site settings, would that be useful?\n- I believe the documentation was posted recently about how to configure the api, but I can post it again. Are your thank you pages not landing pages?"
