If it’s in your internal hyperlinks:\n\nThis is likely happening because marketers are copying and pasting links when hyperlinking internally instead of searching the page. \n\nThe ?hs_amp is coming from amp urls and the ?_ga is from Google Analytics. They should be removed from the hyperlinks. GA will add this automatically when it’s needed but only right at the last second before the click occurs. if someone copies and pasted when hyperlinking they should strip it out first. Better to just use the page finder when hyperlinking though. \n"
