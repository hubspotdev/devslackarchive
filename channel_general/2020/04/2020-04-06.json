With our default blog, the url always contains `/topic/` but with all new blogs we create using the same template the url contains `/tag/` instead. Is this an update in HubSpot or am I missing a setting somewhere?\n\n<https://blog.layertec.nl/topic/toepassingen-3d-printers>\n<https://blog.layertec.be/tag/toepassingen-3d-printers>",
