    "text": "Hi everyone!\nWe have come across an *undocumented* requirement in the Theme validation process in HubSpot Marketplace, which seems to be either a misunderstanding or a bug. While this requirement may be suitable for *standalone modules* in the Marketplace, it is not ideal for *Themes*. Specifically, this requirement restricts custom modules in a Theme from having the *same `label`* (not *`name`*) as the default modules.\n\nFurther details and reasons explaining why this requirement may not be advisable can be found in our <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Improvements-to-HubSpot-Asset-Marketplace-Theme-requirements/idc-p/819367#M148694|post in HubSpot Ideas portal>. However, we are uncertain if this portal is the appropriate channel to receive a response. Therefore, we are reaching out here as well, in hopes that someone can assist us or connect us with the appropriate contact.\nThank you in advance for any help provided."
