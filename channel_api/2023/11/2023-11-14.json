    "text": "Hi there, I'm having a pretty big Issue with the conversation API. So a client is doing a lot of sales through Whatsapp and some times people autofill their old number into a form submission before enaging in whatsapp leading to a shadow contact to be created in HubSpot. Now we've found a way to set up a trigger to find the right contact but no matter what we try we aren't able to connect the conversation with the contact through the API, only through the UI's button for \"Associate contact\"\n\n\nFirst we get the ID of the contact by hitting the conversatin API and then we tried to merge the 2 contacts with <https://api.hubapi.com/contacts/v1/contact/merge-vids/278401/> but this doesn't work as I'm guessing the shadow contact isn't recognized as a real contact\n\nUsing the associations API (to also associate the correct connect) returns a succes response but doesn't update the UI (I'm guessing thats due to the fact it can't display 2 associations)\n\nAre there any fixes here? Is this an API issue and needs to be brought to HS engineers?"
