    "text": "Hi everyone I've been encountering an error regarding tags being rendered from HubSpot module, even if there are empty fields. For example, on the form moudule from HubSpot you have the option to include a title or not to it, but in my case even if I leave it empty it stills renders an H3 tag empty, therefore penalising the performance on every form for bad accessibility. This also happens with the rrss_social_media module.\n\nHas anyone found a solution for this o I just have to duplicate the module and deleting the optional field?\n\nThanks in advance",
