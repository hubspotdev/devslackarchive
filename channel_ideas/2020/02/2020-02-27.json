    "text": "Would be nice if there was a way to select the revision (or have a version tag) on modules. It would enable users to quickly change between an old and new version of a module on a staged website/landings page. So you could show the new version on the staged page and keep the live site intact. For now I'm doing this by just making a clone of the module and add this one in staged page."
