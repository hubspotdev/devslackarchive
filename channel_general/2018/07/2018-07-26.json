    "text": "Hi all, Tom here from the HubSpot forms team. \n\nJust a heads up. Recently we pushed a change moving the domain that loads form definitions from <http://forms.HubSpot.com|forms.HubSpot.com> to <http://forms.hsforms.com|forms.hsforms.com>. This change was to improve security on our forms and to provide a greater consistency across our tools. \nWe are seeing some cases come up where forms are failing to load due to a server only allowing specific domains to load within their content security policy. If you have specific domains setup on your website’s content security policies, we would advise you add <http://forms.hsforms.com|forms.hsforms.com> to these domains to ensure your HubSpot forms can load correctly. \nThanks!",
