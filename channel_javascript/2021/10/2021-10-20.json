I'm trying to set the variable currently using\n\nvar state = (_$form_.find('input[name=\"state\"]').val());\n\nThis works fine for text field (like email) but isn't capturing the value for a dropdown field like state. The console reads the value as 'undefined'. Happy to post more code but I'm sure I'm not targeting the dropdown correctly. Thanks for the help!"
