    "text": "Hi, we would like to move an existing page (a collection of various custom modules and standalone css/js files) under a dedicated theme (in order to enable dnd for mobile-breakpoints mainly). Are there certain aspects to keep in mind? Would it even be possible? Guess that moving modules around would affect existing pages referencing certain files or modules up to the extent they get broken.\n\nSo is there a way to build it the theming around it? Or would the option only be to build up transit-files and modules, integrate them - those would then have to be selected prior to creating a page.\nThis aspect may work for Landingpages - yet how would it be on a blog? Is there a way to ‘wrap’ both by merely adding the ‘theme’ around an existing file/modulestructure?"
