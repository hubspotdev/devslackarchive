    "text": "Hi all,\nI'm working on my first theme in HubSpot, following the advice of the example. I have a problem: often in the pages that I develop there is a button (with anchor link) that refers to a section (with id) of the same page, maybe further down.\nNow with the development of the theme I'm trying to create this situation but I don't know which id to \"hook\" the link of the button and how to set a default link in the code of the html template I'm developing.\nThanks for your help",
