    "text": "Hello!  I have run into an issue a few times where workflows trigger inconsistently.  I can view the form submissions which should trigger the workflow and see that sometimes they trigger it and other times not.  The workflow is set to allow re-enrollment so I know that isn't the problem.  Also when I test the workflow, it works correctly.  But at random times it just doesn't trigger.  This is causing issues with our accounting groups not getting important emails relating to client accounts and billing.  I've reached out to HubSpot support on this and they verified that the workflow is set up correctly and said it could just be a transient processing issue with HubSpot which doesn't help much.\n\nAnyway, I was wondering if anyone else has had this issue and was it resolvable?  Thank you."
