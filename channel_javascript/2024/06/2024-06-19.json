    "text": "Hi! I have searched the slack channel to see if anyone else has posted/fixed this issue. We are seeing a javascript error on a site that essentially looks like a phantom tag. No one on our team, nor HubSpot support can find the origin. Here is just one example but more than 150 404s are coming up across all the site pages in Search Console and other SEO reporting tools. Here is an example of the 404: <https://www.premieritmn.com/articles/javascript>; originating on page <https://www.premieritmn.com/articles/is-your-companys-it-department-understaffed> (blog post). Anyone else seeing this issue?",

    "text": "I expect that you’re 100% correct, <@U077BR2FVU7> — great catch! To elaborate a bit:\n\nWhen using `&lt;a&gt;` elements to trigger scripts, the common practice is to set the href to a value of `javascript:;` — note the `:;` at the end. `javascript:` indicates that the href value is of the type `javascript`, and the `;` indicates the end of the Javascript statement.\n\nSince you’re missing the `:;`, the crawler is instead interpreting that href value pointing towards a page with a slug of `/javascript`. Since that page doesn’t exist, it finds a 404.\n\nThe correct solution would be to swap those `&lt;a&gt;` elements out for `&lt;button&gt;` elements if they’re being used to trigger Javascript events. `&lt;a&gt;` elements are only supposed to be used when navigating the browser to another location, or to an anchor point on the current page. However, you can update the href to include the colon and semicolon on the end as a quick fix, if necessary."
