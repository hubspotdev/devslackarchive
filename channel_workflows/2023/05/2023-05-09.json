    "text": "That's weird and it shouldn't happen. Can you show a screenshot of the workflow and also the custom code? The simplest thing to do is to just do a trace to debug it. I'd start with the following and see what you get:\n```exports.main = async (event, callback) =&gt; {\n  console.log(event.inputFields['contact_id']);\n  console.log(event.inputFields['customer_number']);\n  console.log(event.inputFields['vat']);\n return;\n}```\nTry it without a delay, just a basic workflow with your triggers (don't forget your re-enrollment triggers) and see if the data is outputted in your Action logs."
