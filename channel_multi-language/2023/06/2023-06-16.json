    "text": "Sadly no, not in an elegant way, a couple of possible ugly workarounds:\n• Create a copy of header and footer with just one global variation (for example one header for the english version, one header for the french version etc...) and based on the page url, show a different header (so if the url is <http://website.com/en/broken-link|website.com/en/broken-link> it will show the english header), not optimal as you have manage different global partials instead of one\n• Fetch the correct header via Javascript, based on the same principle, if we land on an english page you can fetch for example the english homepage, search for the header and swap it programmaticaly with the one you have on your system page, also not optimal as you'll see the header swapping when the page load\nI usually just leave those page as they are, hope HubSpot will let us create multilanguage variations of system page one day"
