I found this function: `topic_cluster_by_content_id(content.id)`\nBut looks like it doesn't provide you URL to topic or \"slug\" of the topic.\n\nAny idea how it works?"

HubSpotsÂ native site search is not what I am looking for. Or is the solution to implement pagination, search and filters with for example jQuery? <https://www.facebook.com/business/success> would be the solution I am looking for in a blog post listing template:)"
