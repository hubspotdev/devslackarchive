I have some dev background but haven't done much lately, and it seems like I should be able to fire some javascript to get this done...\n\nI want the chatflow module to expand and launch a particular chatflow on the page when a CTA is clicked. I don't want the CTA to navigate anywhere (though, if necessary, I can pick a page).\n\nIs this at all possible?\n\nLonger version: I want a primary CTA in our website header to \"Request Demo\". I want the chatbot to fire up when that's clicked, so that I can navigate through some qualifying questions before sending them through to a sales rep.\n\nThanks in advance!"
