    "text": "I need some help trying to deploy a react front end using the boilerplate as a kind of vehicle to do so. I built the entire front-end outside of the boilerplate. I can run “npm start” without any issues. Everything displays fine before I edit App.js, but when I actually try to render my own components, the only thing that displays is “Something went wrong…” which I assume comes from the &lt;ErrorBoundary&gt; tag in “index.js”. I figure the problem happens with App.js because things break when I change that. This is how my App component in App.js is written:\n`function App({ moduleData }) {`\n  `const [auth, setAuth] = useState(false);`\n\n  `const authSetter = (state) =&gt; {`\n      `return setAuth(state)`\n  `}`\n\n  `return (`\n    `&lt;div _className_=\"cms-react-boilerplate__container\"&gt;`\n      `&lt;div _className_=\"App\"&gt;`\n        `{auth ? &lt;GetAuth _onLoad_={authSetter} /&gt; : &lt;AppContainer _logo_={logo}/&gt;}`\n      `&lt;/div&gt;`\n    `&lt;/div&gt;`\n  `);`\n`}`\n\n`export default App;`",
