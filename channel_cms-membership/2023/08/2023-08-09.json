So they self register, as in they start and complete the process on their own. They fill out the form, they get the email to create their password, they click the button and setup their password. Done. You didn't have to do anything for them."

    "text": "I think I am missing something, with the flow you just stated they fill out two forms right? One form(A HubSpot Form that will add them to a private content list), then an email then a second form to create their password. With the self registration checkbox, it allows the contact to skip the first form, they just go straight to creating an account, filling out their email and then their password on a single page. Then they get an email to verify their email address and go straight to the content. I was wondering if I can customize that email and password form because looking in the design tools that page just goes loads the registration module. With this flow that I currently have I am not using a regular HubSpot form anywhere.",
