    "text": "Hi everyone. I have an issue with *losing price breakdown information* when extracting data from HubSpot. I can see that information when I open my deal (i.e. Item A (unit price $100) x 5 = $500, Item B (unit price = $50) x 2 = $100, total amount = $600). However, when i export directly from HubSpot (all columns and associations) or connect with API, I am only able to see the line item ID/names and total amount. *How can i check the unit price or number of units of each line item?* Thanks in advance."
