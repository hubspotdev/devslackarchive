You have the base template and can drag/drop into the content area of the blog post.\n\nOnce you have your theme in place, go to the website settings area, then blog. You can assign both a listing and post template to your blog. This will automatically apply to all of the posts in the blog. Then you can go the new listing page and edit as needed."
