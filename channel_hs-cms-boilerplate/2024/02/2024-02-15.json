    "text": "Hi Megan, there isn't a way to add additional fields to the blog author configuration.\n\nYou can create a separate hubDB of supplemental data that you can connect to a custom module that leverages both the default author profile and your custom data.\n\nIt's a lot of work for a small change, if the field you want to add is something you think others would want them I would recommend adding a feature request in the <#C26E7JT8V|ideas> channel or in the community directly so it reaches the product team"
