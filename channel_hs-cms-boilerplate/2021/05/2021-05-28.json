    "text": "Generally speaking yes.\n\nWith Vue.JS it’s a little different because Vue works pretty well when sprinkled around in separate modules. It just depends on the kind of stuff you’re trying to do.\n\nI believe ReactJS has also evolved with portals etc to make it easier to work with these components separated. I would defer to someone who’s more experienced in the current version of React though to chime on that"
