    "text": "Hi Developers, \n\nI hope you are all staying healthy and safe. I have a couple of updates I would like to share. \n\n1. *Module submissions to the Marketplace now require a module icon*. I'm sorry for the confusion about this change. If you're developing your modules locally using our new CLI tools you can add a module icon using the icon parameter in the meta.json file mentioned <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/building-blocks/modules/configuration#meta-json|here>. If you're building your modules in the HubSpot design manager, open your module in the design manager and click on the module icon to choose a new icon to make it something other than the default (see screenshot). For more details, updated documentation will be shared shortly. In the meantime please let us know if you run into any issues or have any questions. ",

    "text": "2. *Themes available in the Marketplace date postponed.* Given these uncertain times we are going to postpone the date that themes are made available to users in the Asset Marketplace. We want to give you the time you need to develop great themes. We will be taking this day by day but the hope is to make themes available once we have received 5-10 submissions. I will continue to post updates in the coming weeks. Again if you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out."
