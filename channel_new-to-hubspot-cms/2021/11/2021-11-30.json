    "text": "Hi all!\n\nOur new website is on wagtail cms and our old one was on husbpot, we have the new site in wagtail up and running and we want to switch the primary domain in HubSpot over from the old site to the new one. Are we able to do this without affecting the wagtail site? (essentially the backend of HS would say the primary domain is the site that is the wagtail site and we would just be using HS as the CRM to handle all the deals and pipeline stuff)\n\nSo I think the question is, can we set the primary domain on HubSpot to a site that already exists on a different platform?"
