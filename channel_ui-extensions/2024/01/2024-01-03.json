We need to trigger actions on data changes.\n2. Handling More Properties: We're hitting a limit with 12 properties. Any tips on managing more? Considering splitting across multiple instances, but had saving issues. Ideas?\nThanks for the help!",

I will add this to the list to discuss with the team for potential future improvements.\n2. Our current limit is 12 but we have been considering revisiting this limit. How many properties would you like to display? As a workaround, have you tried to add two `CrmPropertyList`s inside a single card?"

This feature would be incredibly helpful for performing validations when properties change. Regarding your second point, yes, I have tried using two CrmPropertyLists in a single card and it does work well, except, unfortunately, with the single checkbox props."
