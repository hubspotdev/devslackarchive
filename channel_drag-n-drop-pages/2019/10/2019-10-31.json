    "text": "Hi,  I think I noticed some misleading  descriptions in  <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/hubl/hubl-supported-tags/dnd-areas> . It says, dnd_row must be nested within a dnd_area and dnd_columns are possible children of dnd_rows. The Editor says “dnd_row cannot be a descendant of tag dnd_area and will ignored”.  Same thing with columns. The Editor only accepts a row in column in a section in an area.",
