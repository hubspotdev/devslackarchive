Maybe I’m misunderstanding, but I think what you’re describing is precisely what a dynamic page is - one main page with a HubDB table listing (like <http://example.com/table|example.com/table>), and then dynamically generated child pages for each row (like <http://example.com/table/row1|example.com/table/row1>).\n\nYou’ve probably seen this before too, but if you check out the coding portions, it might help. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/dynamic-pages/hubdb>"
