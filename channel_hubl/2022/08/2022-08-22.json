Is it possible you don’t have custom objects with that category?\n\nI’ll also mention that calling out 9 separate calls to the hubdb database for a category change is very inefficient. If it were me, and others can argue here if they’d like, I’d make one call and push them into the different categories. doing 9 individual calls for what you are doing seems expensive, considering the limit is 10. Just because you can make that many calls doens’t mean you should"
