    "text": "Hi all, I have a problem with the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/module-theme-fields#hubdb-row|HubDB Row module field>, it seems it doesn't fetch any Foreign ID data / values. All you get is the ID of the row it points to. This means for every single foreign ID I need an additional `hubdb_table_row()` call, but that function has a limit of 10 calls per page, and I will need plenty more than that to fetch all my foreign table data. Has anyone come across this issue and solved it?",
