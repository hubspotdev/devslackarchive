    "text": "Thank you Matthew,\n\nthe script should use the existing contact owner property. To go with an external logic will be okay.\n\n\"Extend HubSpot User with address information\" --&gt; To get additional information, like the address, from the HubSpot user, I guess it is the best way when every company employee (hs-user) is a contact as well. That the maintenance can be done in HubSpot.\n\n*Concept:* \nIn the end it will probably look like this: When the visitor fill the HubSpot form, a web-hook will be triggered. That leads to a symfony application, which compare the new lead with a list of HubSpot employee contacts. an external map-api find the closest employee and set the ownership property for the new lead.\n\nIs it true, that a Enterprise Version is required to trigger Web-Hooks? Even with the API?  Docu: <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/de/workflows/how-do-i-use-webhooks-with-HubSpot-workflows>\n\nRegards, Mitja"
