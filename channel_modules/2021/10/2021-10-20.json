    "text": "hey all, I am a new HubSpot developer trying to make a custom blog listing that includes more data than just the title. The layout would be including\n1. type of cuisine\n2. name of the recipe\n3. amount of time to make the recipe\n4. total amount of ingredient\n5. average cost of the ingredient\nSo I was wondering if there is a way to include those fields in the  blog post object so that I could extract that data during the listing process ( list content.price, content.recipe_time)",
