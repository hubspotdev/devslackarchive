We provide some form of shortcut to doing a fetch via the CLI. A potential option being that it generates the fetch command with the path to the module for you. (that way there’s no dealing with zip files which could clutter your project folder and require waiting for zipping/unzipping)\n3. We provide a copy feature similar to how we do with the fields.json for meta.json data."
