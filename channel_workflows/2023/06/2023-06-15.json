    "text": "Hi team, would really like to understand how best to tackle a workflow running based on another workflow.\n\nUse case Zac Smith and Tim Smith are both related to Company X. They are correctly enrolled in a Contact based workflow on list based trigger. The workflow update the related Company property with a property from the Company. This too works as I see the Company property history updated twice because of the 2 Contacts.\n\nThere is another workflow on Company which I have on property (referenced above) update. The problem is that this workflow on Company triggers only once and re-enrollment is enabled. How would I have the Company trigger twice for each update? It seems the Company is enrolled once only after workflow on Contact is complete.",
