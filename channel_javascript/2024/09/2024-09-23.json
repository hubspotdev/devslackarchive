    "text": "Hi friends!\n\nI'm building a little Chrome extension which dynamically inserts a button next to a particular field in our CRM when a Company record is opened (see screenshot). This works when opening a record in a new tab but if you were to browse from one company to another, it won't run.\n\nCurrently I'm doing this using window.onload with a timer to ensure the class I'm targeting is available before I fire createElement to create my button.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has had experience running scripts to dynamically change the content of pages in HubSpot and what a good alternative to window.onload might be in this scenario. Basically just looking to run my script when a particular class becomes available to select.\n\nI appreciate this might be a bit messy/hacky :slightly_smiling_face:",
