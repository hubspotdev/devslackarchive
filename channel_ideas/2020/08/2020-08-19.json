HubSpotters will change the status to one of many statuses to communicate “being considered” ” implemented”  and other statuses.\n\nRight now we are working on ensuring we communicate really well when it comes to features that  are definitely coming, and features that are stable - through the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog|developer changelog>.\n\nFor less-than stable functionality we are thinking about ways to surface things better. That said being a publicly traded company, we are limited in what we can reveal we are working on ahead of time, and will not be able to disclose everything. Plus sometimes big features are like presents, it’s more fun when they’re a surprise.\n\ncc: <@U2H3TT8F2>"
