The boilerplate demo website isn't combining CSS at the moment (actively looking into it). Is your CSS also not minifying? If so I'd recommend running the different CSS files through a CSS linter just to make sure there aren't any errors in the CSS as that prevents these features from working. I'd also just note that if you're making frequent changes to the CSS you might have to wait a little bit in between changes before minification/combining runs again (see the note here: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/cdn#css-minification-and-combining> for more details)."
