I’m covering designing “HubSpot First”, pricing, getting your first 100 active installs, demarcation between your Control Plane and App Plane especially if you plan to release a 2nd app, along with an app create and listing live demo. Plus tips for gotchas and pitfalls once your app goes live. So much to cover so little time! See you there"
