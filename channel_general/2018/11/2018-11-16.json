    "text": "Hey <@U9MAWTESW>, the featured image is a pretty common issue, as WordPress does not include featured images when you do a regular post export. If you have just one blog to export, I've seen success with this if you export \"all content\" from WordPress. This export will include the featured images (which will upload them to your HS file manager), and the HS blog importer does an okay job of detecting the featured images. Do this on a test blog in HS if you don't want to mess up the blog you're importing the posts to.\nRegarding publish date, if you keep the publish status during import, then the publish date will be maintained on all your posts."
