I have already my code, but after testing it out with 4 contact names on my CSV (3 that are on my Contact List databse from HubSpot, and 1 that is not), my output is this image I am attaching:\n\n\"False\" meaning that it is not on my Contact List database from HubSpot.\n\nCan anyone help me?\n\nMy intention is to program a code while using my API Key, so from a CSV file (Column A - Contact Name), get which Contacts Name are on my Contact List database from HubSpot.",
