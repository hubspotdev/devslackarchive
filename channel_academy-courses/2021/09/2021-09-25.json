    "text": "Hi <@U0225RX4QET>.  Thanks for the reply.  I'm totally new to VSCode and fairly green at web dev, so it's possible the CMS for Devs course is making some assumptions about how I have my machine set up.\nI was able to install the package by using the \"sudo\" command.  Still not sure if I'm doing this right though.  Also got a few messages about things being deprecated.  Screenshot attached.",

    "text": "There was no mention in the video about having node.js installed either, so I installed that based on what others have commented in this thread.  I understand that this course is intended for people with an existing webdev workflow/background, but it's the only resource I could find on making changes to themes.  There doesn't seem to be much middle ground with HubSpot CMS between full-fledged developers and bloggers.  So for now, I'm just trying to get over the initial learning curve so I can make a few basic changes."
