I'm updating the record.\nAnd I don't know what field a user might modified... All I want to know is who made that last modification, but you can't tell that because HubSpot doesn't update the `hs_updated_by_user_id` field after my api does an update. It just gets left at the previous value."

    "text": "<@U07SKR0FZNW> No problem. Yes, that makes sense. My only other thought would be to use webhook subscriptions, rather than a \"get all records updated/created since\" type approach. You could configure the webhook subscriptions just for property value changes relevant to the properties managed by your app. Might not suit your use case, but just a thought :slightly_smiling_face:"
