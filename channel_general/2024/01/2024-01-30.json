I.e. when I scroll the page with the scrollbar pressed, the page loading stops and any animation (until I let go of the scrollbar in the browser) , and when I scroll with the mouse scrollbar, everything works normally and the page loads in the meantime. Does the focus on the scrollbar stop the page loading? On my site it also stops the loading of assets in the network tab (Chrome browser). I use gsap and scrolltrigger for animations on my HubSpot site.\nMega strange. Someone can advise something? I am posting the video.",
