    "text": "Hi there <@U011M51020L>, CMS Hub is deeply integrated with the whole HubSpot App (CRM, Workflows, Email Marketing, Personas, social media, ads, forms, conversations, reporting etc). Because CMS Hub is a SaaS platform we can quickly make improvements, seamlessly without requiring manual updates. In-fact we make updates to the platform many many _many_ times a day.\n\nTo make the whole system work seamlessly and identically to the live app offline would require obnoxiously frequent updates on your end. In-addition some app capabilities rely on cloud-centric technologies and redundancy that would be difficult to reproduce offline. Because of this you cannot fully run your website locally.\n\nWhile you cannot run CMS Hub offline, What you can do is use the CMS CLI, and your favorite code editor, in-tandem with a developer sandbox account and use that as a full featured, always up-to-date development environment.\n\nFor more tips on setting up a good development workflow see <https://designers.HubSpot.com/tutorials/creating-an-efficient-development-workflow>"
