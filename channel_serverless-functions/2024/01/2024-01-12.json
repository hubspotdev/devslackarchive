    "text": "definitely - you’ll just want to make an API request using whatever client (I’m a big fan of axios) using an ID (probably record ID) sent from the client side, and then send the response back to the client.\n\nTake a look at the sample project <https://github.com/HubSpot/ui-extensions-examples/blob/main/deals-summary/src/app/app.functions/get-data.js|here>, created by HS. There is a lot of very useful stuff in those.\n\nThe actual documentation for serverless functions within projects is another good resource - <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/platform/serverless-functions>.\n\nThat should give you what you need to get going."
