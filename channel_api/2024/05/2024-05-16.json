    "text": "Hello there, need a small advice\n\nWhen I was reading the HubSpot official documentation, I found the statement \"Products themselves can't be associated with other CRM objects. However, to associate a product's information with a deal or a quote, you can create a line item based on that product. \". Looks quite clear!\n\nBut on the other hand, I found out that currently it is possible to create direct association between \"Product\" and \"Deal\" objects through the Associations API. For that purpose user can use next route: <https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/associations/Deals/Products/batch/create>. Moreover, I also found out that specific Association Type id exists in the list of HubSpot defined associations for connection between Deal and Products: type id - 630, association type - \"Deal to product\".\n\nIt is also possible to add fields \"Product -&gt; Deals\" (Products table) and \"Deal -&gt; Products\" (Deals table) on the HubSpot CRM web version.\n\nIs it some new functionality that just was added or some old legacy? Is it safe to use this association type?",

My understanding is that direct object-to-product associations, like the one you pointed out, are more for reporting things (for example, the most recently purchased products at the contact level). However, directly associating a product to a deal won't work with quotes or the other e-commerce APIs. <@U039ZD1F71P> you might be able to correct me if I'm wrong."
