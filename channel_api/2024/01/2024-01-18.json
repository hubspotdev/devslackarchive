    "text": "Unfortunately it is not just database storage. It will impact any JavaScript code that interacts with JSON received from HubSpot APIs that present full range 64 bit IDs as a number. Native JavaScript `number` data type cannot handle full range 64 bit integers.\n\nExample: if you query the API the raw HTTP response body (text) from HubSpot might look like this:\n`{\"vid\": 9123372036854000123}`\nTo work with this response in JavaScript it is converted to an object. Most browser/API clients transparently hydrate HTTP response `content-type`'s that are `application/json` to JavaScript objects, mapping JSON numbers to the JavaScript type of `number`. The standard function for this (built into all modern JavaScript runtimes) is `JSON.parse(...)` -- which will yield the following as a JavaScript object:\n`{\"vid\": 9123372036854000000}`\nNotice that vid is now rounded & wrong.\n\nThere are no trivial ways to work around this. Most APIs do not transmit 64 bit integers as numbers for this reason; rather they transmit them as strings which work great:\n`{\"vid\": \"9123372036854000123\"}`\n\nI would say that the HubSpot dev team are aware of this as with their more modern APIs they -- generally -- use this stringified number format for 64 bit integer IDs."
