    "text": "Hello! I was wondering if someone can help me out with this? I want to create a language switcher module with the function to be able to toggle between English, German and Chinese. I went through the proper steps listed in the documentation where I create multi-language pages. I have my web pages in all 3 languages, just need to create the proper button switcher for it.\nMy language switcher already senses what language the web page it is so... I want to create a for loop of the list of languages, urls attached to them, and image of country flag.\nI could hard code this myself and create buttons containing the link to the proper web page but I feel like I wouldn't be utilizing HubSpot's Language Switcher efficiently this way.\n\nI don't know how to create a proper for-loop and adding in URLs the Hubl way.",
