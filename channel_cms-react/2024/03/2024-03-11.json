I'm hoping this lovely community can help me with an issue relating to the recording of \"first page seen\".\nWe are running HubSpot with our own consent banner on our Next.js frontend, with some custom code to record page changes. For some reason  \"First page seen\" is being recorded without url parameters, which means new traffic from paid ads do not have their traffic-source set to \"paid search\", making it impossible for our marketing team to provide accurate data on how effective our ad campaigns are.\n\nBelow is the code snippet for our HubSpot script implementation, which is integrated on the root app page.\n\n(please let me know if this is the wrong place to post this, or in the wrong format)"
