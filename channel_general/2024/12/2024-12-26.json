The agency claims that not all the HS cookies are removed after the user opt-out.\nAs I said, I hadn't had a lot of experience with cookie banner problems before, so maybe there is something I don't know, who knows, right :woman-shrugging::skin-tone-2:\nThanks everyone for joining the convo!\n\n&gt; HS does need a few cookies active even in that state\nIs there anything in HS documentation about those specific cookies that HS still needs?"
