    "text": "Hello! We have an issue with transferring a substantial amount of Blog Posts over to a new template. The issue is that the Blog Posts look awful with the new template due to the layouts being very different, so we must take one Blog Post at the time and make changes to its content (images, spacing, etc). However, there is no Content Staging for Blog Posts and you can only switch the template for all Blog Posts at the same time. Has anyone come across a similar issue before?"
