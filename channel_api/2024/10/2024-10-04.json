From reviewing the slack channels and help it is clear the hs_marketable_status (Marketing Status) property is read only and not updatable via the API.  Has anyone managed to get any clarification from HubSpot why this is the case or the rational? It seems a very odd approach and don't understand the logic behind it. Reverting to manual updates or workflows is incredibly inefficient."
