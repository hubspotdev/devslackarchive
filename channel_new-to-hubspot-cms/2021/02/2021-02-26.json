    "text": "Hi there!\n\nI’m a web developer, fairly new to HubSpot CMS. I have a couple of questions, hopefully you guys can help me.\n\n1. How can I fetch an existing js file from my current finder on HubSpot to my local machine? I was able to find in the documentation the following command: `hs fetch --account=&lt;name&gt; &lt;src&gt; [dest]`  but any name or src I used gave me the following errors: \n```[ERROR] The request failed because \"script.js\" was not found in account 6968579.\n[ERROR] Failed fetch of file \"script.js\" to \"/Users/Desktop/some-file-name\" from the Design Manager```\n2. In the Editor Page section, I want to control the colour and font size of a CTA (button), but I don’t have that option. How can I add that? I added a Field of CTA_text and CTA_link, and to those I want to be able to control the colour and font size.(screenshot attached).\n\nThank you all!",

    "text": "1. Make sure that you are using the correct path. In HubSpot's design manager, you can right-click on a file and \"copy path\" so that you are sure you are accessing it correctly using the CLI.  <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started-with-local-development|HubSpot CLI/Local dev environment documentation>\n2. If this was a native HubSpot CTA, you would control this in the CTA editor. Since this looks like a custom-built CTA module, you can either add those <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/module-theme-fields|settings to the module as fields> or you can use CSS to control the color and font size.
