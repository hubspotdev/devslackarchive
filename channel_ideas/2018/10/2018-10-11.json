But if you look at the options under `settings &gt; website &gt; pages` the average marketer technically has the power to load jQuery in the footer and change the jQuery version - talk about a chimp handling a grenade! Instead of making bad font choices, they can potentially break site functionality. I argue for centralized font settings in order to help companies stay on brand.\n\nFor example, plenty of our clients have had a “dangerous marketer” randomly go and download templates from the marketplace and choose random google fonts provided with the template pack. Their pages ended up looking like a ransom note because they had too many fonts. If font options were not provided and they were centralized, that wouldn’t have happened. And the average marketer isn’t going to think to include their company stylesheets when they are downloading templates from the marketplace, but if they do… the company’s stylesheets may break or alter a marketplace template.\n\nWhat if a marketplace template could prevent this by providing a typography setting called “inherit from global font settings”?\n\nIDK… just an idea. And I definitely understand y’all’s reservations. Sorry for the long post"
