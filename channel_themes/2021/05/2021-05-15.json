    "text": "Yes im in the same boat. I have a client that is consolidating a few portals into a single portal and moving multiple domains into a single sub domain. Each of those sites, although tied to the same brand, Def has a different feel/style to the site. It would be great to be able to use multiple child themes on the same portal for sure. But I suppose the current work around would be to have the same parent theme cloned a few times and branch off of thoseâ€¦ But its not ideal for updates"
