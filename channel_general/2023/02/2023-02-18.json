I see we can use `overrideable=false` for modules, but that doesnâ€™t work for or account for sections/columns/rows. One solution would be to use `overrideable=false` on the modules and not use dnd areas, but it goes along with this question <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C22PU4LV8/p1676764111489009>, where I want to keep the HTML markup consistent with normal drag and drop areas. Would be nice if we could use `{% section %}`, `{% column %}`, and `{% row %}` (non-dnd variants)."
