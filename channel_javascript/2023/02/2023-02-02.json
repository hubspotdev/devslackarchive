If you set the heights of images, I think this would cure that issue.\n\nI’d use `window.scrollTo()` , using the positioning from `el.getBoundingClientRect()`\n\nI’d also look at `event.preventDefault()` or even `event.stopImmediatePropagation()` , to prevent event bubbling\n\nIt looks like the problems are solved, but figured I would give my 2 cents here"

    "text": "Thanks for the clarification Matt! At least we can rule that out as a problem. I'll keep troubleshooting, what we have seen is that sometimes on first page load, the `HubSpotutk` cookie isn't being set, then when we send the data to the HubSpot Forms API, we see an error on the submission saying the cookie isn't being sent. We are also setting the `pageName` property in the `context` object which works, so we're very confused why our `hutk` isn't coming through",
