    "text": "Hello, question regarding headers and partials.\nIm trying to create a partial header that is not global. According to the docs I need to create a Template of TemplateType: partial but there is no such existing TemplateType which in turn throws an error in the design tool. I tried creating a Standard_partial and using it in my template with the\n```{% include \"../partial/header.html\" %}```\nexpression also found in the documentation but this also throws an exception saying \"Missing Template\". Can anyone explain what is up or point me in the right direction for this issue it would be great. Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:"
