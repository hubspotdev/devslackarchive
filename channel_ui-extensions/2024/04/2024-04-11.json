    "text": "Hi <@U06RDTNS2HG> - trying to understand what you mean with \"despite having products and line items selected as objects to copy over\", where are you seeing that you can select these?\n\nWe don't support syncing down products and line items from prod to sandbox. But I'd like to see what might be causing you to think that we do if you're looking at the UI. Any chance you can share a screenshot of where the confusion is stemming from? Thank you!"

Painful to have to totally recreate al these objects and enter dummy data when trying to create custom components to interact with them (because they have fewer options that other objects, like being required for example)",
