    "text": ":wave: Hi all. Iâ€™m the PM for HubSpot memberships. I was interested in chatting with some partners who develop for BOTH HubSpot CMS AND other CMSs (e.g., WordPress, WebFlows, etc.) and use Memberships/private content (either on HubSpot or those other CMSs). If anyone is open to chatting, find my meeting link here: <https://HubSpot.com/meetings/angupta3/30min-meeting-link|meeting link>",
