You can update contacts via the api on these items, or use your events — attaching/associating them to a contact.\n\nYou can get the HubSpot id by looking up the record using the contact api, looking up by their email, and returning the id. then you can create the association of the contact to the event, or just fire off the event.\n\nUpdating a property on the contact is a bit more streamlined, you just update the property, and then the workflow is triggered. You can update contacts via the api using email address or HubSpot contact id.\n\nThen you create a workflow that is a contact workflow, when status is any of “trial-end” then send the email."
