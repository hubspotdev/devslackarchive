    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nSometimes in my workflows I have this error (screenshot), I think it's because of HubSpot limitations API rate or something like that, is there a way to filter that in my `catch` of my custom code ? I would like to trigger a zap that send us a message when there is an error in a custom code but avoid this error, since this is not really an error and HubSpot will automatically make it work some minutes later.\nIf I test myself a custom code I will never get this error because limitations will not be reach, so I can't know how to filter that in my catch..\nThank you for your help !",
