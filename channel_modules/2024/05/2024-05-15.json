    "text": "Hi all - I'm on our Product team and wanted to share that we've built a way to make files uploaded to custom file properties 'public' (rather than private, which was what was preventing these fileIDs from being used externally). This change will apply only to newly created custom file properties in the short-term, but we plan to enable it for existing file properties in the longer-term.\n\nIf you'd like access to this change &amp; would be willing to test it out, please share your portalID and I can give you access today.",
