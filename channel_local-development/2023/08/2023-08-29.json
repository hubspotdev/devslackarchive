    "text": "Hi everyone, I would love to hear what your development workflows are like, specifically if you are on a team with other developers.\n\nI've recently started learning HubSpot development, and I'm a tad confused on how to properly work with multiple developers on the same site. I built this diagram to try and explain how I currently understand it should work.\n\nMy main question is, how can multiple devs work on the same site and not overwrite eachothers work? If a standard sandbox was created off of the live site, how can we all work in that same sandbox, while using the HubSpot cli to watch and upload files to it at the same time? Is my diagram the correct way? Each dev using their own CMS sandbox account?\n\nWould appreciate any help or guidance! Thanks",
