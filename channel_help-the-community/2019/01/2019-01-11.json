My use case is that I have a series of rolling deadlines for classes that we run and right now we end up having to edit those in a bunch of different places. I’m trying to make life easier and be able to update that date in a single place. It seems like Snippets would have been the answer but my sense is that snippets are more “autocomplete” and less “storage variables”. Any help would be extremely appreciated!",
