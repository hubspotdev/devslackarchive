    "text": "it's somewhat of a preference, here is the technical difference:\n\nWhen you add www. in front of a site, it acts as a hostname which can help with flexibility with DNS, the ability to restrict cookies when using multiple subdomains, and more.\n\nWhereas *non-WWW domains, also called 'naked domains', do not have a technical advantage*.\n\n<https://www.benchmarkdesign.net/index.php/announcements/13/WWW-vs-Non-WWW-Which-is-Right-from-SEO-Perspective.html|Here's a full article with explanation>\n\nIt all comes down to preference, but you can also create a redirect from the non-www to the www or vice versa if you're concerned about how others will enter the site (as long as you have both configured properly in your DNS) - the same way that your http will redirect to https even if they don't type it."

So to solve this I added a secondary domain to redirect to <http://www.legafrik.com|www.legafrik.com>. It works but google talking about an SEO problem .I would like to know is this the right way to do it ?I am a bit confused"
