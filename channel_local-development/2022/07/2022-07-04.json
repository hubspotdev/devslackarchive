    "text": "Hi All,\nLet me start by saying that I am new to HS but not new to web design/development or VSC though sometimes I know just enough to get very confused. CLI is something I have used, but not a whole lot.\n\nI am having trouble understanding the config file process:\n\n&gt; I followed the quick start guide to configure the local development tools\n(ran hs init, entered the personal access key, entered name of the account, and got the [success] message) and was able to create and successfully run the my-website-theme project and could use hs watch.\n\n&gt; the next day I tried to follow the getting started with modules tutorial which had a different folder name but did not go through hs init (or hs auth) because I had done it the day before. Though I could establish the new project and download the files, the hs watch did not work. I had to use hs upload. I noticed the HubSpot.config file was not in my local project directory.\n\n&gt; Yesterday I tried a third project, with a third folder name, but this time ran hs auth, entered the access key and got the [success] message. However, the HubSpot.config file is not in the local directory.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? I know it’s a simple fix, I just don’t know what it is.\nThanks for the help!"
