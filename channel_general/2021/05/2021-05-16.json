    "text": "Hi All! I'm new here. I am developing my first landing page in HubSpot, and I created my own template and form. My problem is I cannot get the form to show on my page the way I have it designed. When I populate it into my page (via the template I have created)..it loses all styling and does not allow me to edit it in the capacity I wish to. I've looked at a bunch of documentation on forms, and am still stuck. Any advice? Thanks!!"
