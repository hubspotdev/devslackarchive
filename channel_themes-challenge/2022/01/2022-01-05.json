Per the Submission requirement you mentioned above, during the judging portion of the contest, we (HubSpot) will be providing your theme free of charge for testing, evaluation, and use by the Sponsor and Judges during the contest and until the judging period ends.\n\nLet me know if that helps clear that up :slightly_smiling_face:"

We will deliver the theme to the judges on our end as free (no worries, once the contest ends, they will no longer have access to it :slightly_smiling_face: so they cant just walk away with a free theme)."
