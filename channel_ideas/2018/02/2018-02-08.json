I staged a copy of a sites homepage. edited up the page a bunch, kept saving throughout(haven’t published to staging yet) did refresh the screen. went to publish and discovered the staged page was no longer in staging but in the website pages. fortunately I didn’t publish or it  possibly could have overwritten the homepage.\n\nI went into content staging  and my staged version of the homepage is there stating the last time I edited it was when I first created the staged page, and the page I was working on is now in the website pages as a draft. It’s a separate page from the homepage page fortunately.\n\nSo I don’t know what happened other than something maybe screwed up when I refreshed prior to publishing but that is kind of a terrifying thing"
