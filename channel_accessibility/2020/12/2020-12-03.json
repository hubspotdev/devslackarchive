I think the way I would approach this:\nuse the embed code for the form, and then use the _`onFormSubmit`_ method to search the form to see if any errors are present and then scroll to it\n<https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/forms/advanced_form_options>\n\nprobably a more advanced solution. I’m not sure if there is an easier one."
