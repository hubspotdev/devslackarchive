    "text": "Hello, everyone,\nI am asking anyone who is familiar with hubdb and hubl to help me solve a question.\nI have a \" performances \" table which is joined to a \" dates performances \" table.\nThe performances obviously have different dates and some within the same month, while others straddle 2 months.\nNow, should I write something like 8 - 12 August if the months of the dates are the same, or\n8 July - 12 August if the months are different\nThe question is,\nhow do I verify that the months of the dates are the same or different?\nThe loop containing the dates is\n{% for foreign_row in row.list_date|sort(False, False, \"date_time_start\") %}\nI tried this\n{% if foreign_row.date_time_start|datetimeformat('%B')|first == foreign_row.date_time_start|datetimeformat('%B')|last %}\n...\n{% else %}\n...\n{% endif %}\n\n{% endfor %}\n\nbut it does not work\n\nAnother big question would be, how to group the performances by date, having a joined table.\nI succeeded with dates inside the main table but with a joined table I don't get a spider from the hole\nAny ideas on how I can proceed?\nThanks\n\nGiovanni",
