Here’s a working example of identifying a user by their email and updating an abandoned cart custom property:\n\n```var _hsq = (window._hsq = window._hsq || []);\n    _hsq.push([\n      \"identify\",\n      {\n        email: email.value,\n        abandoned_cart_url: window.location.href,\n      },\n    ]);\n    _hsq.push([\"trackPageView\"]);```\nAlso, please confirm that the site you’re working with has the HubSpot tracking code installed."
