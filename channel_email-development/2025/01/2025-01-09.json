    "text": "Hey guys, I'm struggling with something so simple as to be ridiculous: responisve icons sizes in emails. I just want icons to be 50x50 on mobile and 80x80 on desktop. I have to achieve it in Drag and Drop emails, not based on Custom templates (correct me if I'm wrong - Custom templates doesn't allow us to manipulate with modules - change order/add/delete etc.)\nTiny background here: in my emails I use modules that contain inline stylings. However I can't use in these modules CSS with media queries as they are trimmed off by HubSpot. As I understand following docs, applying \"hs-inline-css\" is possible only in custom templates but custom templates as diqualified in my case (because of mentioned above requirement of email's content modules manipulation) <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/guides/cms/content/templates/types/email-template-markup#responsive-email-template>\nAny hints are welcome! :)\n<@UJAPS2K4N> <@UKGV272KS>",
