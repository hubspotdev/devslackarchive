Then let's in 2 weeks if the people in list didn't fill in the form or unsubscribe to the mail, we would like to send a reminder e mail.\nI could use an approach with two lists. One for all the people we want to target and the second with the people in the list who didn't fill out the form after 2 weeks. Then send 2 mails, one for each list.\nI've also see that we can use sequences but since we didn't buy the sale package I don't know if it would be the solution for us. What do you think?",
