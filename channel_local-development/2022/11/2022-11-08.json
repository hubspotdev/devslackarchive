Has anyone had recent success following these docs to set up CI with the manual configuration? <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/guides/github-integration>\n\nI did this a few months ago successfully using an API key, but with the upcoming deprecation of API keys, I’m trying to swap to using my personal access key. Not having a ton of luck - it doesn’t seem like the `generate-config.js`  example is fully correct. I’m pushing through it, but I’d really appreciate a working example of that file if anyone has one.",
