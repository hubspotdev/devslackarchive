    "text": "Hello everyone,\nI have a question about the HubSpot Marketplace theme. Suppose I have a theme published in the marketplace, and a client designs a page using that theme. Later, I need to provide an update where I make changes to some variables, and the updated theme goes live. If a client who has downloaded my theme and created a page with it receives a notification about the update and proceeds to download the new version, will they lose their data due to changes in one of our moduleâ€™s variables?",
