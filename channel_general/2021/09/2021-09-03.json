    "text": "Hello everyone, I do have some questions about many to one relationships. Here is the best I found; : <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/One-to-many-custom-object-associations/idi-p/372856> or <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Associate-a-Standard-and-Custom-Object/td-p/479312>, is this true ? I mean that we can structurally make a many to one, but the interface won't handle it correctly (always the add button, etc). And more in a list view this won't be possible to have the to-one displayed like we have for the company in the contacts list view ? Thanks for your answer."
