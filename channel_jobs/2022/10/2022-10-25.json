    "text": "[For Hire][Remote][Front-end developer][Full-Stack developer]\nHi.\n\nMy name is Joseph Lee and I am from New Jersey, US. Currently I am working as a Senior Front-End Developer with years of experience in web development.\nIn order to be a good Front-End Developer, there are a couple of mandatory techs to have and they are HTML/HTML5, CSS/SCSS/LESS/Sass, jQuery/JavaScript/ES6.\nI am very old with these technologies and have got a razor sharp eye for the details.\nI am proficient in working with React.js, and have strong knowledge of Front-end design principles and best practices, including understanding when and where user testing and research should be incorporated into the product design process.\nThere are numerous design patterns that are available in React.js. Stateless components, React Hooks, and etc...\nAnd also I am familiar with React Hooks. Hooks are comfortable to use and easy to read for engineers as it is functional based. And I can build the functionality to handle API responses in Redux using Axios.\nI use several libraries like TailwindCSS, Material UI, Semantic UI, AntD, Bootstrap, etc.. I do pixel perfect design and it should be fully mobile responsive.\nI specialize in Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga, Redux-Form, React-Hook, Reselect, Context, Axios, and many other useful React/Redux libraries.\n\nCurrently, I am available full-time, and I can start this project immediately.\nKindly reply to this message and let me know when would be a good time for us to connect this week.\nLooking forward to hearing from you for further process.\n\nBest regards.\nJoseph"
