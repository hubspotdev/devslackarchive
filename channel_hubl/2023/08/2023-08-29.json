    "text": "Seconding the `@apply` directive approach. To elaborate a bit more as to why — since Tailwind’s styles are baked in at build time, you can’t guarantee that a class that you add via Javascript will have been generated.\n\nWithout the advantages of styles-in-markup or JIT style generation, applying Tailwind classes to forms via JS comes with no benefits. It’s going to be harder to develop, requiring you to write a script that covers a large number of (potentially unpredictable) use cases, and it’s going to be a worse experience for users, who will see the form styling shift unpredictably as the page loads.\n\nI know that the official position is that `@apply` is to be avoided — if you’re concerned about the potential complications it can introduce, there’s always the option of just writing the CSS the old fashioned way."
