    "text": "<@U01K5P6M9PY> You have to create multiple blogs with different languages: `group.language`. And then you can compare the blog language to the post language: `pop_post.language` . If it is like you said, that you get mixed languages from the `blog_popular_post`* function. Then filtering the related post manually seems the only way. I didn't test this, but should be work that way. And maybe an additional fallback if language is unset in the blog-post.\n\n```{% for pop_post in pop_posts %}\n  {% if group.language == pop_post.language or pop_post.language == null %}\n    &lt;div class=\"post-title\"&gt;{{ pop_post.name }}&lt;/div&gt;\n  {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}```\n* blog_popular_post: <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/functions#blog-popular-posts>"
