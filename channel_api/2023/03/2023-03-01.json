You do not directly associate a Contact or a Deal with a Campaign (this is the way that Salesforce \"thinks\" about this idea - i.e. you create an association between these objects - the \"Campaign Object and the \"Campaign Member\")\n\nInstead, in HubSpot, Contacts become influenced by a Campaign based on the content they interact with. Then, if that Contact is associated to the Deal, then the Deal is said to have been attributed to the Campaign."
