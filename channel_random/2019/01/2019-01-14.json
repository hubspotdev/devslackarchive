    "text": "Hi. I have a question and din't find the right channel to post it...\nWe are using the forms from HubSpot on our website. We build a small extension that grab the forms from the platform. It is similar to the embbed code from HubSpot but the user can't just paste an html code in backend from the cms, just give the id of the form they want to use. Anyway I want to add the conversion tracking code from Google. I've seen that you can add this in the header of the website when your website in on HubSpot. In my situation the form is on our website and the \"thank you\" page is also a page on our website. The form in Huspot redirects the user to our page to thank them.\n\nWhat would be the best practise in my situation? Should I add the code only on my website? Thanks.",
