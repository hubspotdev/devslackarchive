A client of mine is looking to pass the HubSpot Contact ID as a query parameter to the url we provided at the end of lead form i.e. <https://app.tryflowspace.com/app?hsid=1234515>\n\nI'm not sure if this would work in real time as HubSpot would likely need a few seconds to generate a new contact ID first but maybe it's possible! I work in marketing ops, not dev, so I'm adding <@U04AGAF1CGL>, VP of engineering at my client's company, to provide more context if needed!",
