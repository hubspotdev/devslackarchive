    "text": "If your forms would all have something in common in the name, then you could use a list to handle the enrollment into the workflow based on the recent conversion property value containing the common string, and then limit it to in the past X amount of time so that re-enrollment is possible. There are some possible issues I can see with that, but it's worked for me in one case so far.\n\nI'm hoping the newer version of the automations workflow will allow for updating an existing workflow at some point though.

Instead of the url parameter:\n```hapikey=xxxx```\nyou need a header that says:\n```Authorization: Bearer xxxx```\nLet me know if any of this doesn't make sense"
