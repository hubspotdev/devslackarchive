I assume it should be something like that:\n \n```{\n  \"label\": \"Position Image\",\n  \"name\": \"img_position\",\n  \"type\": \"alignment\",\n  \"alignment_direction\": \"HORIZONTAL\",\n  \"visibility\": {\n    \"hidden_subfields\": {\n      \"???\": true\n    }\n  },\n  \"default\": {\n    \"horizontal_align\": \"LEFT\"\n  }\n}```\nAny ideas?",
