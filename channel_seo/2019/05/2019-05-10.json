Basically, I'm wondering if this event box is becuase of Structured Data or becuase of the hosts adding the event in Google Maps. When I click on learn more, it brings me to a strucutred data article (so my assumption is that), but I was also curious if it could be part of their new public events feature in Maps (<https://support.google.com/maps/answer/9275870?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3257381>)",
