How can I import Bootstrap from 2 or more different modules but just making one call on the page level? Are the modules smart enough to not import linked css/js if another module was importing the same file already?\nThank you",

I want to be able to set `how many` + `btn_text` + `url` of each button through the template.\n*Field structure example:* Buttons (_the parent_) &gt; Button Text\n```{% module \"button\" path=\"theme/button\" \n   // need to figure out how to add the repeater options here\n%}```\nCan I access it via dot or bracket notation? The documentation only shows examples of fields that are parents (not nested) and not inside a repeater.",
