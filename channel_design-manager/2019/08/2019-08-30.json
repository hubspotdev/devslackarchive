    "text": "Hi everyone! I'm new to HubSpot as well, a very experienced designer and somewhat experienced coder, but I can't for the life of me find where to add spacing in between the default footer social icons at the footer of my email templates. I also plan to add custom images, which I think I see where/how to do. I've just tried several places with adding some padding between these guys, and no luck! If I can't get it figured out, I may just add space to the new icon images I upload, which isn't as ideal! Thanks for any guidance!",
