    "text": "Hi everyone,\njust a quick question. Does anyone know well how meta descriptions work?\nI've noticed that if I search on Google for a website we made for one of our clients, among the main results is the home page of course but its meta description appearing under the title seems to vary depending on how I'm typing the brand domain in.\nThe home page has title and meta description properly set up in the page's settings from the editor and I was expecting to see them reflected on every search I make for the home page but that doesn't seem to be the case.\nAnyone know the behaviour under the hood?",
