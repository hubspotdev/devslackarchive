I don’t know if this is the proper place to post this question, but it might have to do with workflows so here it goes.\n\n I have a behavioral event (legacy) that comes from Segment called “Coupon Applied”. Inside this event’s JSON, there’s a property called “coupon_id”, which is really the coupon code. The event refers to the moment in which users in my e-commerce apply a certain coupon to their shopping cart. I want to save this “coupon_id” property in the corresponding Contact object. I have created a property in the Contact objects called “Last Coupon Applied” with internal name “coupon_id”, but the field is not getting set with the value coming from the event.\n\nI tried coupling a workflow triggered by the behavioral event, but I couldn’t find the option to set the Contact property with the coupon value coming from the event. Could you help me with this?"
