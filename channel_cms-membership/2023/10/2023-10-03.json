    "text": "I have a question. I needed to create a reserved space page with a login and a password connected with Firebase to display information to the visitor. The HubSpot account didn't have the enterprise version of the CMS, and the data was already only available in Firebase. Now that I publish my page, I get this message: \"This content was reviewed and found to be a likely violation of the HubSpot terms of service. These reviews play an important part in keeping your account secure. They may be triggered by unusual behavior in your account, or content that asks for usernames, passwords, or other information prohibited by our terms of service.\" Have you ever encountered this problem? Can you help me?"
