    "text": "*EDIT: Please disregard, I misread the question. Sorry! Please see my follow-up response for actual relevant information.*\n\nTo set max width, you’ll need to add two parameters to your `{% dnd_section %}` tag. `full_width` _(boolean)_ and `max_width` _(integer)._\n\nTo set padding and margin, you’ll need to add the `padding` and `margin` properties, respectively. Each of them accepts a dictionary containing the `default` and `mobile` properties, which in turn contain properties for each absolute direction — those absolute directions take their values as strings, including units.\n\nPutting it all together, you should expect something like this:\n```{% dnd_section\n    width=12,\n    offset=0,\n    full_width=false,\n    max_width=768,\n    margin={\n        \"default\": {\n            \"top\": \"32px\"\n        },\n        \"mobile\": {\n            \"top\": \"3rem\"\n        },\n    },\n    padding={\n        \"default\": {\n            \"left\": \"16px\",\n            \"right\": \"16px\"\n        }\n    }\n%}\n\n    ...\n\n{% end_dnd_section %}```"

    "text": "To point towards an answer to your actual question: I don’t believe this functionality is properly documented and I haven’t found a firm answer on how it works. The clearest answer I’ve gotten is just “set it in fields.json” without any specifics as to how to make it apply to your grid.\n\nHere’s an <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/main/src/fields.json#L565|example from the theme boilerplate> that I’ve seen referenced multiple times. I happen to be a little skeptical of that answer, however, as there doesn’t seem to be an answer as to how those theme values are linked to the dnd elements.\n\nWhat seems to be a more likely answer to me would be <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/blob/main/src/css/theme-overrides.css#L153C1-L153C1|this section from the theme overrides CSS file>. I’m not sure whether it’s the selectors, being in theme-overrides, using HubL for the values, or some combination thereof that makes the values apply to newly-added dnd elements.\n\nAs far as I know, that’s all of the official guidance on the subject — beyond this, I suggest experimenting and digging around in other themes to find a clear answer. Good luck!"
