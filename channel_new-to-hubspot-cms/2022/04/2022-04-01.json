    "text": "Hey <@U02KH4V10BS>, here are a few other ways you could write it.\n\n`{{ 'Date is still ongoing' if module.datetime_field|unixtimestamp - unixtimestamp() &gt; 1 else 'Date has passed' }}`\n\n`{{ unixtimestamp()|between_times(module.datetime_field|unixtimestamp, \"millis\") &gt; 1 ? 'Date is still ongoing' : 'Date has passed' }}`\n\n```{% if unixtimestamp()|between_times(module.datetime_field|unixtimestamp, \"millis\") &gt; 1 %}\nDate is still ongoing\n{% else %}\nDate has passed\n{% endif %}```\nThe first two are essentially the same, just with slightly different <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/if-statements#inline-if-statements|inline if statements> and methods to <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/filters#between-times|find the time difference>. Use one of those if you just need to output a class or text in a tag.\n\nThe last one is just the second one rewritten so you can wrap blocks of code.\n\nReplace `module.datetime_field` with your date and time field value.\n\n`unixtimestamp()` will output the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/functions#unixtimestamp|current time>.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions."
