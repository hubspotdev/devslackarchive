    "text": "It's a new enough marketplace because current drag-and-drop themes were only launched in 2020.\n\nPayments are taken directly through the marketplace through Stripe and something else (PayPal? I forget, I use Stripe).\n\nI think one of the reasons there are currently a lot of free ones is because HubSpot have a few theme accelerators this year focused on increasing the amount of free themes. There's one starting this month you might want to check out, the link's somewhere on the Slack. Also, a lot of agencies use free themes to drive leads for their paid services."

But I think there's definitely room for more paid themes and am planning on working on one later in the year.\n\nSome don't seem to sell so well, but if my math is correct, the top selling themes have made over a million dollars... :money_with_wings:"
