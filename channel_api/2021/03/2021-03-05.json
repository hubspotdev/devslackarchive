    "text": ":wave: the workflow log events API only supported contact workflows. Adding non-contact (company, deal, ticket, custom object, etc) workflows was part of a larger automation overhaul, and after we completed that, updating the old log events API to support all of the new features we added would have been a pretty substantial lift, and we couldn’t justify it based on the relatively low usage that API got.\n\nIn the future, we might create some version of this API that supports all object types. But before doing that I think we’d want to check if there’s a better way that we could be solving these problems. For the example you gave, enrolling in another workflow and waiting for that enrollment to complete is a feature request that we’ve gotten before, and we will likely eventually support this directly in the workflows app, without the need for a custom action.\n\nIf there are any other use cases you can think of here, particularly in conjunction with the custom actions API, we’d love to hear them!"
