    "text": ":wave: Hello all,\n\nNew to JavaScript and am having trouble finding an example to learn from. :book: \n\nAfter enrolling companies into a workflow using list membership I would like to save those companies into an `array`\n\nThat way, I can sort them descending by a numerical property. In the end, I would like to flag the top 25 companies via a custom property.\n\nDo y'all have any examples of moving enrolled records into an array for basic SQL manipulations?\n\nAppreciate y'all!",
