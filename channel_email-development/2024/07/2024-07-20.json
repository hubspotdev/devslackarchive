    "text": "Hey <@U07C65L86QY> - it has been tried by several devs(inlcuding myself) since the email dnd editor was released.\n\nShort answer: Unfortunately it's currently not possible to modify the head-tag of DND email templates.\n\nLong answer:\ndue to technical (and potentially legal) reasons it's curerently not possible to modify the head-tag. You have to think\nI've  tried custom modules, `{% require_head %}... {% end_require_head %}` (which works in pages). doesn't work since email modules don't support any type of `{% require... %}` like `{% require_css %}`, `{% requiere_js %}`(obviously)...\n\nAlso: While you technically could create a custom module with some css styling which you would just drag&amp;drop into an email. The result of the module will - most likely - be stripped by the email client on reciever side. Outlook and Gmail in particular don't \"like\" css outside the head-tag. My recommendation: Don't invest time into trying to create a working module (even if it might look right in the preview)\n\n\nMy recommendation to anybody who want's to get completely custom email templates: Drop the idea of dnd emails and start developing HTML e-Mail templates with a bunch of custom modules that fit your requirements.\n\nYou can get even some sort of flexiblity in HTML templates if you wrap the whole custom module code in booleans and if-/unnless-statements..."
