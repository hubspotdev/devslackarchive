This seems to also be reflected here in the docs:  <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes/responsive-breakpoints#define-breakpoints-in-a-theme>\nSo it is not supported yet and I might try adding a custom columns module. It’s a good idea anyway as I can also add gap size settings and so on."
