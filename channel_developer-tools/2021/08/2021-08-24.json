The links/pages to the quote expire when the quote expires, so the links direct customers to the standard 404 page that I have set up. Is there a way to instead direct them to a second custom 404 page that would be for expired quotes? I’m not sure at what point I could intercept the redirect or if it’s even possible in HS.\n\nI’ve opened a <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Dynamic-404-Pages-for-Expired-Quotes/m-p/483858#M46191|question> in the community forum if you want to check it out.\n\nThanks",
