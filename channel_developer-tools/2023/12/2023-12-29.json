I’m not sure whether you have two different module versions present on the page, or if these are two instances of the same module and there’s something that’s causing each instance to generate its own script.\n\nEither way, I think that’s almost certainly going to be where your problem is coming from — there’s only one event listener on the page where the module is working.",
