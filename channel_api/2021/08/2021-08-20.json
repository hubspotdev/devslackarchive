    "text": "Short answer: store the refresh token server side, they don't expire and you use it any time you need a new access token, no user intervention required.\n\nLong answer:\nOnce you've authorized the integration (which requires a user to confirm the login), your oAuth flow should handle the token exchange server side. The first step is taking the `code` provided by the user driven step, and exchange that with your client secret to get both an access token and refresh token (they come back in the same response).\n\nThe refresh token is then valid until a portal user uninstalls the integration from the HubSpot portal. You can store the refresh token in your system/server in a DB or environment variable and then use it in your server side processes to request a new access token anytime you need one (access tokens are good for 6 hours)."

Batch Contact Creation API can create/update up to 1000 Contacts in a single request.\n2. Batch Ticket Creation API can create up to 100 tickets in one API call.\n\nOr, If the solution could save the tickets in a middle space and schedule them to create the next availability of APIs.\n\n3. Every time a user initiates a request to create a Ticket...queue that ticket within your processing system, notify a user about their awaiting queue Number. As soon as a ticket gets created successfully in HubSpot...a mail could get the schedule to notify a user about queue creation and further communication.\n\nI hope this sounds logical."
