    "text": "Good morning all. I am new to the community. Not sure exactly what Channel i need but I am having some issues with HUBDB Calling Child tables.\nThe problem I see and cant find any docs or info is that I noticed that When I am calling the hubdb_table_rows for the child tables it only iterates through the first 4 child tables.\nI was using the docs regarding nested tables and all works well but for some reason It does not loop through the rows of the 5th child table and beyond. Can some one help me shed some light on this? (edited)\n[10:02 AM] I even created dummy tables with simple light rows to test it and it still would only fetch row content for the first 4 child tables"
