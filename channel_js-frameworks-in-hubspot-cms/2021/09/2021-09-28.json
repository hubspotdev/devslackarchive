    "text": "Unfortunately Serhat it seems that method I suggested may not work in the latest version of Vue. I’m not sure right now what the best solution is. At the end of the day the CTA  HubL generates an embed script. You don’t need to use the HubL tag, and can instead use the JavaScript directly.\n\nSo following a solution for embedding any kind of JS embed into a Vue JS application should work. Perhaps looking for one intended for  injecting like a YouTube or Vimeo video would work. Then you’d follow those directions just substituting in the HubSpot CTA embed code.\n\nThat’s unfortunately my best suggestion right now.\n\nIf you find any solutions you like, I’m happy to get our documentation updated to better reflect this."
