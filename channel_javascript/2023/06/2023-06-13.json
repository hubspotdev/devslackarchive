    "text": "Hi everyone! I'm using HubSpot Chatflow in embed mode and want to display a marker in my interface when a user has unread messages. I am aware of the `unreadConversationCountChanged` event and it works, however the event is not fired when the page is loaded. For the user, it looks like this: he sees the marker, but after reloading the page, the marker disappears, despite the fact that there are still unread messages.\nHow can I get unreads on page load? I found an endpoint `api/livechat-public/v1/thread/visitor/recent` , which seems to have data I need. Can I use it in production? And how can I use it. (I could't find any docs about this API)\nThanks."
