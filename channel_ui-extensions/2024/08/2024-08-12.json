Even if we have to create a list of what properties are used in an extension ourselves in e.g. a JSON file. We create and remove lots of properties over time, and the way we determine if they’re in use is through the “Used In” section on the Property Overview, but there is no way for our admin team to see if we use the properties inside UI Extensions.",
