For now it only works with an API key\nDo you have any kind of estimation about it? When it will be possible? We are very excited about ability to use GraphQL! Thank you!"

Or how could I filter `Companies/Contact` with multiple values for the same field? If field doesn’t have associated operator `__in`.\n\nThank you for opportunity to use GraphQL!",
