    "text": "H!\n\nIm creating a ticket module for CMS on a password protected page, I want to show the hs_pipeline_stage and HubSpot_owner_id. For  hs_pipeline_stage I get a number and for HubSpot_owner_id I get an id. When using the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/beta-docs/reference/cms/hubl/functions#crm_property_definition|crm_property_definition> function to get all the properties information the properties are empty. When using a select property that is not created by HubSpot all the data is shown.\n\nIs there a way to get all the data from HubSpot_owner_id to match it with the correct ID, or another way to get the label value of HubSpot_owner_id?"
