    "text": "Hi, I just noticed the new (?) brand colors setting. It says that colors added will be available in all color pickers but when I check the color picker in the page editor (e.g. when setting background color for a section), it shows a row with “Favorites”. However, these are the 6 colors I’ve defined in the email settings, not the brand colors. Is this WIP or has anyone figured out how to display the brand colors in that context?",

    "text": "Hey Shamash, good find. This is indeed a new set of brand color settings. There’s a few areas where they’re still not actively being used, which we’re working on plugging up. The website color pickers are in development right now and should be complete pretty soon. At that point they’ll be pulling directly from this new set of account-default colors. Bit by bit the set of colors in Email Settings will be sunset and deprecated but we’ve got a few remaining steps to get there. Let me know if you’ve got any questions on it :+1:"

Seems like a completely unnecessary update and it was more beneficial for the Blog urls to contain the Blog IDs on the backend. For example, right now when I go to: <https://app.HubSpot.com/website/{portalID}/blog/posts> it gives me the default, but if I switched to another blog it gave me a new URL with the BlogID so I could share with the specific team that has a specific blog, I think that should be reverted back."

Assuming you aren't going to rearrange anything, you can just write a bit of css for this particular page, using the specific .row-number-## class to target only the row you want to change. So -\n```@media (max-width: 767px) {\n.row-number-12 &gt; .row-fluid {\n  display: flex; /* Allows you to rearrange things*/\n  flex-flow: wrap; /* Lets child elements wrap */\n}\n.row-number-12 &gt; .row-fluid &gt; .dnd-column:first-of-type {\n    order: 2; /* Move the text, which is in the first column, below the second column */\n}\n}```"
