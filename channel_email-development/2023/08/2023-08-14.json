And published the DOI email by clicking creating DOI email link. during the publish, I also confirmed the DOI enabled and for only some pages option. But it is not working for my side. :thinking_face:\n\naccording to this <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/email/set-up-double-opt-in-for-emails|article>, this should be worked as the expected. but when I submit the form in the specific page that added in the list (specific DOI enabled list), but I didn't received any email. also checked in the SPAM folder, but doesn't exist."

    "text": "Hi, I belive there's an intermittent bug with the drag and drop for email templates.\n\nWhen I try and \"Drop\" any module (custom or default), there's no green line that shows where the module is being dropped. So even if I drop it anywhere, no module appears and I have to try it again. But even after trying again it doesn't work.\n\nI also save and close the email and reopen and it still doesnt work.\n\nThen it randomly works at a different time.\n\nHas anyone seen this behavior before?"
