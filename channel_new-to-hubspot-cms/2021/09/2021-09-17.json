    "text": "Hello all, I'm completely new to HubSpot, and have been trying it out with a developer account. Today, we have one instance of HubSpot hosting our production web site. We are looking to build a web form hosted within HubSpot to communicate with our APIs. Our APIs have three environments - DEV, PREP and PROD.\n\nI'm interested to know if anybody has a similar setup or best practices as to how they manage changes through the environments. For example, would you look to have three forms called DEV, PREP, PROD on the one site communicating to the different APIs in different environments. Password protecting the non-production pages and copying content between the pages when there are changes.\n\nOr look to use three separate websites and copy content between the websites?\n\nI'm also interested in whether there are any other controls that others may use when publishing content. For example, could a 4-eye control work within HubSpot? From what I've seen it seems no.\n\nI did some searches in Slack/Google on this topic, and couldn't seem to find anything related to this question. Apologies if the question has been asked before."

    "text": "Hi John, great question. I'm also really interested in this. As another newcomer to HubSpot development, I am struggling with the best way to handle these kinds of issues, although I'm not even developing APIs (just theming/components).\n\nDon't know if it pertains to your question at all, but I've been thinking I might manually version my components, and retire/hide old versions. That way they can still be edited, or replaced by content editors as needed, but I won't break them as I'm developing new ones."
