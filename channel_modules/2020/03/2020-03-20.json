It may in the future.\n\nYou are correct this should be documented as a tag, and that it doesn’t appear to be in the page for that.\n\nThe inline_text tag and the module version of the tag are somewhat the same thing.\nThe only difference is that the text module is an actual module, and the text tag is a true HubL tag. The tag can be used within a module, where as the module version cannot be placed inside of a module because modules can’t be nested."
