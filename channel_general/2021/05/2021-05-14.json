When did they change to an integration? the urls of files uploaded look like:\n```<https://api.HubSpot.com/form-integrations/v1/uploaded-files/signed-url-redirect/>…```\nHowever this isn’t a public url. My problem is I want to us a field like this to upload profile images. Is there a way to make the urls public for image uploads?\nTag <@U2H3TT8F2> :D",

    "text": "This may not be the definitive answer. I just poked around in the form tool - we don’t appear to have a way to change whether the field makes a file public/private in the UI.\n\nYou can however using the API - which while you can use a custom integration for it - you can also use a serverless function.\n\n<https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog/new-endpoint-to-download-files>\n\nSo basically you could have your form actually just post to a serverless function - then your function could either upload the file direct to the file manager and associate it to the contact, or you could do it the less efficient route and have it be part of the form. Get the url from the contact, and change the URL to a public URL."
