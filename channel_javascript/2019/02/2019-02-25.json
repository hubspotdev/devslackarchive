    "text": "Hi there, I'm having some issues with implementing the Facebook Pixel. So the root of our problems is that any Standard Events that are triggered don't get pushed to our Facebook Ads Account.\n\nSupport recommended not using the HubSpot's integration, but doing it manually.\n\nWhen we followed their advice we stumbled upon a different problem.\n\nAnd here's what I sent to their support (explaining the problem):\n\nWe stumbled upon another issue with manually implementing a Pixel per your recommendation.\n\nWe followed this process (as described in the link you shared with me):\n\n- Open up the template that your landing page is using.\n- When you're in the template, click the button that says 'Edit' in between Actons and Group....\n- Select 'Edit head' from the drop down.\n- Scroll down to the section called 'Additional HTML Head Markup for this Layout'\n- Paste your code in here\n- Click Save\n- Click Publish changes\n\nWe took the pixel from Facebook and implemented it following this process. I then later checked with a client if the pixel is firing properly, and saw that the Pixel Helper tool notified us there's an error and an issue with the Pixel.\n\nWe investigated that issue. I browsed through the code and noticed that HubSpot is mutating the pixel.\n\nScreenshot1 is a part of the pixel that should be on the page (pay attention to the highlighted part). But as soon as we save that, it mutates it to the version on Screenshot2.\n\nWe've now went back with the integration to at least have our pixel on the site, but would like to ask you to further investigate this.",
