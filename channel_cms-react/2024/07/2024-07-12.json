Happy to do a bit of troubleshooting to see if anything looks different between our instances/see if I can reproduce the issue on my end (feel free to DM me the code if that is preferred). I believe what you have above should work in both spots though/not 100% sure why you're seeing a difference :thinking:"

    "text": ":mega::mega::mega: Attention :mega::mega::mega:\n\nWe are happy to announce the public rollout of \"Data Fetching\" at render time with our React Modules. If you are familiar with NextJS, `getServerSideProps` should look familiar. If this pattern is new to you, the main use case is that ability to at render time on the server make arbitrary API calls and pass the results to your Module's render.\n\nWe have new documentation for this <https://github.HubSpot.com/cms-react/reference/data-fetching.html#server-data-fetching-with-getserversideprops>\n\nAlong with a new example <https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react/tree/main/examples/data-fetching>\n\nThis is scoped to pro/enterprise portals, but as always sandbox portals can use this feature in testing.\n\nData Fetching is something we have been looking forward to and hope that it will enable novel use cases. As always let us know of any issues you run into here.",

    "text": "If you update the dev-server to the latest version, optional types should be working similarly to this message: <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/C04AY1H2204/p1716499184497039?thread_ts=1716482760.526889&amp;cid=C04AY1H2204>\n\nRe: type-validation for islands, not really, unfortunately. Due to the way that islands are imported (using the `?islands` param), the TS language server can’t resolve the types for the component and so it can’t be type checked. I’ll defer to the others on the CMS react team on if there are any ideas for a solution to this."

The benefit is being able to have it’s nested children required.
