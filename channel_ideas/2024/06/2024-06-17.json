Having a ping/star would be much more easier to work with since users (content creators) are not using staging by default.  The normal mode is to use the website pages list to make changes depending on tasks. Going to staging just adds an extra cognitive load to an already complex system.  Ping/star mental model is commonly used in other products like here on Slack or even the left bar in MacOS's Finder, though\n\nI wish HubSpot could add this tiny feature, which would help ease the work with pages."
