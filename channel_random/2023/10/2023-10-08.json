    "text": "Hello Developer Community,\nIâ€™m using Splide Slider for a carousel on my website. It works fine in a simple HTML file, but when I use it in HubSpot, I see an error in the console saying `Error: [splide] null is invalid`. even though the carousel still works. I tried initializing Splide properly, as suggested, but the issue remains. Has anyone else had this problem and can help me fix it?"
