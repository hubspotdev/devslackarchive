I had to give that up when my wife got pregnant becuase we were doing some remodeling to the house/garage. 7 years before that it was at someone else's house.  I haven't been super active in teh past two years, but we just got a ping pong table at the office. I'm nowhere a paid pro, and I've played mostly doubles, but I'm comfortable with an amateur title"
