    "text": "Hey :wave: I'm new to HubSpot CMS as well as this Slack so lmk if there's a better place to post this question. Basically, in the drag n' drop template builder, I'm trying to augment two module groups that are positioned side by side (or flexible columns for that matter) with flexbox properties. For example, I'd like to align-items-center between some text content in one module group and an image in another module group. The problem I'm currently running into is that HubSpot automatically wraps the content with additional, nested DOM elements that I don't have control over in the editor, so the flexbox classes don't apply correctly to the nested components I'm trying to target. Is there a way to do this without creating a custom module in HubL?",
