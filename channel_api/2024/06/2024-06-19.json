User can now search, select and change opportunity fields and data of their HubSpot Sales Hub within our app\nI also attached a quick visual of the above. I understand that we need to set up OAuth, connect HubSpot's API, and define the opportunity fields.

    "text": "Great. I didn't know we had upsert capabilities in the V3 CRM Objects API.\n\nI haven't tried this myself. But can you try modifying your request body to include the `idProperty` like you suspected, as follows\n```\"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\":\"<mailto:testing@asdadsa.com|testing@asdadsa.com>\",\n      \"idProperty\": \"email\",\n      \"properties\": {\n                \"firstname\": \"Test\",\n                \"lastname\": \"Contact 123\"\n            }\n    }\n  ]```\nI think we need to use a property (other than the HubSpot Defined \"Record Id\" / \"HubSpot Object Id\") that is configured as unique as the idProperty\n\nI think this is because the Record Id is set automatically by HubSpot and therefore we cannot set it ourself with an upsert."

So I want to get contact by email (not id) but don't found that request with v3 (I've found it by v1). So is it possible to get contact by email with v3?",
