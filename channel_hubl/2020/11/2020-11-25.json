    "text": "Hi everyone, new here and very new to HubL so go easy on me please :slightly_smiling_face:! I've been trying to customize a quote template but the examples given are quite simple and don't contain all the information we would like to display on the quote. When learning about HubL on the academy the tutor mentioned that we had access to all the variables available on the page in a JSON format via a sprocket menu on the published page, unfortunately I don't see this menu anywhere. Is there a way to find out what values are available and where can I get them from? Thank you.",
