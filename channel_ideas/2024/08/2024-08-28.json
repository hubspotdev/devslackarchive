Full disclosure, I'm not a developer. I'm scoping a project for a client.\n\nThey have leads schedule virtual medical consults through their EHR tool, and what those leads to receive informative marketing emails in the lead up to the appt.\n\nthe idea: How might we dynamically include an 'add to calendar' link on those marketing emails that is unique for their appt? The email is automated and the link needs to be unique to their appt.",
