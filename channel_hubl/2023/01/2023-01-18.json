I was wondering if there is any similar HubL Syntax to “content.domain” or “document.domain” in JavaScript.\n\nWhat I am trying to do is make a HubL if-statement to check if the site the user is on is using a .se or .no domain. Based on that it would display the correct module in the websites header.\n\nSo, would something like this be possible. Alternatively, can you use JavaScript code and logic inside HubL If-statements?",

I did loop over every posts and constructed my own object with just the info I need (without the modules), and it worked :slightly_smiling_face: I think the reason why you guys don’t get this error is because you are missing the specific module which is causing the error on my side.\n\nThanks for the help!"

    "text": "Hi there! HuBL question for blog author pages. I’m looking to modify my blog author page _slightly_. I want to ONLY display the “BLOG POSTS BY [AUTHOR NAME]” heading and corresponding blog posts IF the author actually has published/live blogs. Right now, I am trying the `{% if blog_author.live_posts %}` function, and it does not work as expected. It removes the title and section even if the author has blog posts associated.\n\nExample page for author with blog posts: <https://www.readyworks.com/blog/author/paul-deur>\n\nExample page for author WITHOUT blog posts that is still showing the heading: <https://www.readyworks.com/blog/author/cynthia-Terpstra>\n\nAny ideas on how to accomplish this? Thank you in advance!"
