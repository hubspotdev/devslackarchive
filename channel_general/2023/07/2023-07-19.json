I'm trying to bulk submit different line items to multiple deals via the Line Item Bulk Create endpoint.\n\n```HTTP 400\n\n{\n  \"status\": \"error\",\n  \"message\": \"cannot pass multiple to object ids: [14237842234, 14236343297] for one to one association type AssociationSpec{associationCategory=HubSpot_DEFINED, associationTypeId=20}\",\n  \"correlationId\": \"96c9f77e-d458-4c35-84c8-2494eec91240\",\n  \"category\": \"VALIDATION_ERROR\"\n}```\nHeres my data where I'm listing all of the different deal id's in the `associations: [{ 'to': dealId }]`  property. I assumed the types are just telling HubSpot that I want a line item pointed to a deal for each of the deals that I'm listing? Is this not right? Here's my input:\n\n```{\n    inputs: [\n      {\n        properties: {\n          createdate: undefined,\n          hs_lastmodifieddate: undefined,\n          hs_object_id: undefined,\n          hs_product_id: \"2169866052\",\n          hs_recurring_billing_period: null,\n          name: \"DRS Merchant Services\",\n          price: \"14.95\",\n          quantity: \"1\",\n          recurringbillingfrequency: \"monthly\",\n        },\n        associations: [\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14237842234\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14236343297\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14237449841\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14237709730\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14237774242\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14237853551\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14237465694\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14237553585\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14237816931\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14237853197\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14234667366\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14237553453\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14236396467\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            to: {\n              id: \"14238143249\",\n            },\n            types: [\n              {\n                associationTypeId: 20,\n                associationCategory: \"HubSpot_DEFINED\",\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  }```",
