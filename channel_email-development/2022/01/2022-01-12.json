    "text": "Hi All - Happy New Year! I am new to the forum and know enough to be dangerous at this point, so please bear with me if I'm asking newb questions.  Does anyone know how to use a personalization token in an embedded URL in marketing emails? The use case is that I want an http link from a contact record to be clickable in the email body. The current personalization token just seems to insert as text and I can't find a formatting option to format the personalization token as a url. The link embed feature doesn't seem to work with the personalization token.  Suggestions welcome.   Thanks!",
