    "text": "*Update:* FTP connections will be denied for users with 2FA enabled\nDue to security concerns, users with 2 Factor Authentication will be denied FTP connections as of this afternoon, 4/22.\nAs a workaround, portals can create a new two-factor authentication disabled user with only the \"Edit code templates &amp; modules\" permission, separate from their main user, to be used with FTP. This workaround is contingent on 2FA not being enforced at the portal level.\nFeel free to reach out to me with any questions."
