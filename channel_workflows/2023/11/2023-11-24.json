    "text": "Hey everyone! I have a question regarding the server error handling protocol for webhooks. Let's say I automate an API request in response to changes in the Contacts table, and my external server experiences a malfunction. What procedures are in place in such a scenario? Are there attempts to retry the request? If so, what is the delay between retries, and how frequently are they attempted?\nFurthermore, when we activate a webhook and define an API request, does HubSpot check the status of the destination server before sending the request, for example, to ensure it is operational?",

    "text": "Another question: Still concerning data transfer automation constraints, can I set up a modification constraint?\nLet's start with my business issue: My Company in HS is of the 'Non-Marketing' type, which means that theoretically, the data is managed in our external CRM, so no user should be able to modify/delete the company's data. Can I make my company read-only by defining this constraint? This would result in the only way to change the type to 'Marketing' to regain editing/deletion rights on the HubSpot interface."
