    "text": "Hi\nWe are migrating our HubSpot entire site from an old HubSpot Visual Builder template (from 2016) to a new HubSpot DnD (drag-and-drop) based parent/child theme (Minimal Pro by Transfunnel).  Mostly, we just want to apply the new Global Header &amp; Global Footer, but this is not automatically applied when selecting the new template on each page.  Each page would need to have the header &amp; footer manually dragged in on a page by page basis - a total pain.\nMy question is (surely there must be a way):  is there a script or something that can be run to apply the new global header &amp; footer to all pages in one go?  Any advice would be appreciated.\nThanks,\nRiki",
