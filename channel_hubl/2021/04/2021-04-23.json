    "text": "<@U019CMEEG4S> You can customize the _search result_ JavaScript and modify the _request URL_ parameter to do one request for _type=BLOG_POST_ and another request for the other page types. In the _addResult_ function you can place a switch for the different results, so that they get append to different DOM elements.\n\nOr you can filter with a little bit of JavaScript your result object into different groups, the content type is also available in the result object. For more information please take a look at the _/@HubSpot/search_results.module_ and see the HubSpot documentation: <https://legacydocs.HubSpot.com/docs/methods/content/search-for-content>"
