    "text": "Hi all,\nI have a custom workflow action where I am attempting to set a value of a contact property from a 3rd party service. Unfortunately, the 3rd party service takes a long time to process (i.e. more than 20 seconds) so HubSpot keeps doing a retry on the action. I have decided to change this workflow action to return a an hs_execution_state of BLOCK so that it gives 3rd party service more time to process and then initiate a callback complete with the field to update the contact record. I am getting a successful 204 response but the contact still seems stuck in workflow so not sure what I am doing wrong. Here is an example of my payload:\n{\n  \"outputFields\": {\n    \"hs_execution_state\": \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"fieldToPassBack\": \"value\"\n  }\n}\n\nI even tried just passing back the hs_execution_state without the field but still can't seem to move along the contact. Any thoughts on what the problem is? Also, I noticed even when I put a fake callback id it returns 204 so something",
