I actually had a pretty old HubSpot cli version which I now updated to 5.2.0.\n\nThe build gets still stuck but with a different error this time:\n\n```Error:  A TypeError has occurred. Object.hasOwn is not a function\nError: Process completed with exit code 1.```\nNote this error is thrown when the following git action is triggered:\n```      - name: Build JS components\n        env:\n          HubSpot_PORTAL_ID: ${{ secrets.HubSpot_portal_id }}\n          HubSpot_PERSONAL_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.HubSpot_personal_access_key }}\n        run: npx @HubSpot/cli@5.2.0 project upload funnel-project --use-env\n        shell: bash```\nWhen I `npm run deploy`  manually it goes well.\n\nDoes anyone have a clue how to solve this?",
