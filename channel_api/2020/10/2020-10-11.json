For that contact, add some children with their basic details (Name, Relationship, DoB, etc.. around 10 fields) - *Not sure how to do. Need Help*\n3. Display that child information on the Right-Side bar similar to Company/Deal (Like, if we expand then it will show all child details) - *Not sure how to do. Need Help*\n- These Contact &amp; its child details, I think I must have to store in HS. So that those properties/values can be used during creating workflows.\n\nPlease let me know if you require any more details.\n\nThank you.",
