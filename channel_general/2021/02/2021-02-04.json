I can confirm that our TTFB value dropped considerably upon moving out of that sandbox domain to a production one.\n\nWe were also told that _TTFB is dependent on certain key conditions one of them which affects the speed is Pre-rendered vs Dynamic Pages._\n\nI don't want to just verbatim share that support thread, but perhaps some clarification from HS on that final point might be useful \"for the room\". It was suggested that some out of the box features might have a different impact on the performance of the server-side caching, and thus the TTFB. It might be useful for people know what features may contribute to a harsher impact.\n\nI appreciate <@U7SL518D6>'s points. I'll take that list and staple it the developers' desks.\n\nIt's probably worth saying, but I think perhaps 75% of our performance issues can be solved ourselves as developers, but it does take time and effort to understand and make those changes."

It might be useful for people know what features may contribute to a harsher impact.\nI understand wanting this so you can use that knowledge to build more efficient sites.\n\nIn general we’re actually trying to make it so that those differences don’t matter so much.\n\nThat said there is some HubL that makes serving pre-rendered pages harder. For example HubL that returns something different on every page load, such as printing the current time to a page. In that case the moment you ask for the page the pre-rendered version is already old, and we need to regenerate it with the new time added.\n\nWhenever we can we update our documentation to clarify that the page caching benefits will be affected.\nAn example you can see is on the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/variables|HubL Variables page> “request_contact” “request.referrer” “request.remote_ip”"
