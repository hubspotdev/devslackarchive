    "text": "HI Everyone, I'm new in developing in HubSpot. I was given a project where I need to put a module on webpage and pull a email address from a website url and have it auto populate into a HubSpot form, and then have the form auto submit without the customer pressing submit. Is there a easy way to do this? I'm on a tight deadline and haven't done this before. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you",

Then you can add a query parameter to prepopulate is i.e `?email=<mailto:email@example.com|email@example.com>`\n\nThen add this JS to the page and it'll auto submit it\n\n```window.onload = function() {\n  var forms = document.getElementsByTagName(\"form\")\n  form[0].submit()\n}```"
