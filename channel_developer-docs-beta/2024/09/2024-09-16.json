    "text": "Is there any current documentation on the reasons we should or should not declare a `module_id` in our custom components? My hunch is that it is unnecessary or even misleading to add it to a `meta.json` file, but I cannot seem to find any documentation to suggest how we _should_ be using that field. I cannot imagine that HS would allow me to declare a module ID that would clash with something that already exists. *If my hunch is correct*, perhaps the new docs should help distinguish between things you should put in a `meta.json` file, and metadata that you could read about a module programmatically after it is in the system."
