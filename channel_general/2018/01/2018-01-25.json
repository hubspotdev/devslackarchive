In the next couple weeks we will seed the Marketplace with a dozen or so modules. One of those modules with be the HTML module. We will not be delivering the HTML  module to all portals and instead users who would like to use the HTML module will be able to download it from the Marketplace into their HubSpot portal . \n\nIn addition to the HTML module in the Marketplace we will also be adding an HTML field to the new Modules framework. \n\nFor those of you who are providers in the Marketplace we will be sending you all some information in the coming weeks on submitting modules for listing in the Marketplace. \n\nIf your not a Marketplace provider but it sounds interesting you can create a provider account here - <https://offers.HubSpot.com/free-marketplace-account>"

I realize how dramatically complex that could be to integrate and plan out. Just pointing it out because Smart Content is such a great feature for marketers.\n\nWould think it would be pretty reasonable if you slowly added the functionality, for example, starting with rich text fields that are not in repeaters and whatnot(whatever makes the logic easier for you guys to build)\n\n(will suggest with feedback button too, just figured other people, might have thoughts on this too)"
