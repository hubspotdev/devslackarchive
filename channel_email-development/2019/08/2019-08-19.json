    "text": "Hi folks I'm unclear about CSS placement for coded Email templates that include modules. I understand CSS placement for the coded HUBL template but do not understand where to place CSS applicable to individual modules. When I try to build a module for an email template the documentation says 'For example, CSS and JavaScript will be disabled if you select Email templates for email compatibility.' - so how do I apply CSS to modules?",
