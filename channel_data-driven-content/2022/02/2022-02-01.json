    "text": "Hi there, I am working with a HubDB table and Dynamic Pages.  We have the pages generating exactly as we’d like them to, but we’d like to add the functionality to “Archive” a row in the table.  This is easy enough to do so that the page / record does not show in the query where we are showing the full data set, but I would assume that the Dynamic Page is still being created, served, and indexed by Google, etc.  I’d prefer to not have “archived” pages out there in the ether.  This functionality doesn’t seem possible from what I can find.  Any thoughts?",
