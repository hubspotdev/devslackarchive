    "text": "I am updating the Jquery file on a clients webpage and have followed the process detailed in the HubSpot docs, but my issue seems to be that when loading a Jquery file via {{require_js}} as shown, it doesn't load the Jquery file in time for the modules to execute their code so there are still $ errors.  When loaded through the settings&gt;pages via the native HubSpot 1.11 dropdown, it is loaded in enough time and there are no errors.  I know this is probably simple, but how do you guys deal with the later loading of Jquery {{require js}} when dealing with updating Jquery?"
