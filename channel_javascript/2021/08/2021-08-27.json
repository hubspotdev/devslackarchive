    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI’m trying to create a form that users can fill out that validates against the CRM. So the user enters their email address and a code, and if that code matches the code associated with the email address in the CRM then they will be able to edit the contact information associated with the email address. Essentially it’s a login, but using two contact properties that we set rather than a password that we can’t see or edit. Any thoughts on how I can accomplish this given that contact information can’t be attained via API without a separate server?"
