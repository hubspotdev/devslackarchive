    "text": "You could potentially accomplish this by conditionally setting `cursor: default` in the module’s styles/css based on presence of a URL, but that would cause issues for keyboard and screen reader users.\n\nThe better way to accomplish this would be conditionally rendering different markup which doesn’t have an anchor element for instances which don’t link anywhere, something like this:\n```{% if module.url.href %}\n  &lt;a class=\"module__wrapper\"&gt;\n    {# ... #}\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n{% else %}\n  &lt;div class=\"module__wrapper--nolink\"&gt;\n    {# ... #}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n{% endif %}```\nA note on accessibility and design best practices here—any page elements should visually indicate interactivity (or lack thereof) without the need for a user to hover it. Elements which are interactive or navigate the user to other pages should be clearly recognizable, so it’s probably not a good idea to have visually identical page elements with differing functionality."
