I havenâ€™t had a problem with them until recently, where newly published/updated pages with trailing slashes are going into a redirect loop and not returning my pages. Occasionally when I try to add the trailing slash to a page and update it, it drops me an error saying that a page with that URL already exists, when there are no other pages with that URL.",
