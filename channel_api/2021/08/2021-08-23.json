I'm new to the HubSpot community, so please feel free let me know if this question is better suited for a different channel.\n\nI'm trying to use the Visitor Identification API using an API Key for authorization, but I'm getting a MISSING_SCOPES error. The API tells me I'm missing the \"conversations.visitor_identification.tokens.create\" scope.\n\nIs there a way to configure the scopes for a HubSpot API Key? Or do I need to use OAuth and generate an access token with the proper scopes enabled?"

    "text": "Hi all, trying to understand how to connect a Contact object with a HubSpot UTK. Our proposed use case is below:\n\n1. user comes to site landing page via ads. receives a HubSpot UTK by nature of being cookied\n2. user buys product through on-page, 3rd party form. Form is _not_ a HubSpot form but collects value of UTK.\n3. 3rd party service provides our application with a webhook payload that includes user email address and HubSpot UTK\n4. Our application creates a new Contact and associates that Contact to UTK value.\n\nI'm unclear on step #4 as it doesn't look like there's a straightforward way to connect UTK during the Contact creation process. Any thoughts?",
