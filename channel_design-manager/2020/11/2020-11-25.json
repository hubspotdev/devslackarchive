    "text": "Hello. Looking for a method to produce \"print friendly\" pages.\n\nWe have \"marketing sheets\", \"white paper\", and \"case study\" type web pages. We _also_ have that same content in Word and InDesign from which we output PDFs for easy distribution by our sales force. We'd like to be able to maintain that content in a single source, preferably the CMS. Suggestions?\n\n1. \"Appropriately\" tagged content residing in a hubdb row pulled into coded templates (one for web presentation and one for printing to PDF)?\n2. The above but a single template and rely on '@media' to apply print friendly styles when printing to paper or PDF?\n3. Are there commercial HS templates with print friendly rendering built in?\n4. Are there third-party add-ons available for \"print friendly rendering?\n5. Anyone with experience with third-party HTML-to-PDF web services such as Docraptor or others?\n6. Other . . .?"
