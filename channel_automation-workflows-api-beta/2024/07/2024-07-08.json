It works in that it does effectively set the goal for the flow — so flow enrollment/unenrollment will still work. But it doesn’t set the goal filter in a way that will show up in the HubSpot UI, and it can get clobbered when the flow is then updated via the UI.\n\nWe’ll work on this, resolve this be simplifying how goals works across both the product and the new API, so this will take a little while to fix as it’s not just a fix to the new API."
