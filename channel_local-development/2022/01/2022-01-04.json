    "text": "Hello everyone, I'm currently setting up the developer environment for HubSpot at my company and I stumble upon one issue.\nI want to have 2 environments\n1. Sandbox for development \n2. Production - for production :wink: \nAs I understand from the documentation when I build a theme and want to include any images or fonts I need to store them in Files and reference in the code by hardcoding the full url to the file. When I have two environments the base URL is different and when I hardcode it I need to update each file using some kind of script on CI when I push the code to production.\nIs there a better way to reference files stored in Files? Or maybe I can just store fonts and images in the theme directory and do a relative reference in the code. I would appreciate any advice.",
