    "text": "I would love it if I could have global selects within a module and/or aggregate selects within a module\n\nTake for example a simple survey.\nYou would have 2 primary groups Results and Question Groups\n\nthe results would basically be a keystore that you would use with JS\nresult_a, result_b, result_c\n\nEach question group has a group called “Questions” and within that, a group called “Answers” Each answer has a Text field and a value field. It would be great if this value field could be a select of the Results group.\n\nThe other thing would be an aggregate select field. Each question group also has some form of unique ID\nAn answer in Group A that, if selected should skip Group B and go to Group C\nit would be great to have a select comprised of all the groups’ ID fields.\n\nAll of this can be done with some validation and hand-typing values but it’s extremely messy.\nThis may be hard to make a mental model of. Happy to clarify any questions.\n\n<https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/HubSpot-Ideas/Global-And-Aggragte-select-fields-within-modules/idi-p/857468#M156200>"
