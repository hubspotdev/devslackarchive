    "text": "Hey there! I have this flow I want to implement:\n\n• Create a contact\n• Check if a company with a certain property already exists (let's say the property is our production's db group Id for said user)\n    ◦ If it exists, then associate the contact with it\n    ◦ If it does not, then create a company and associate the contact\nI cracked the create a contact part using the `crm.companies.simplePublicObjetctInput` method, but the second part had me stuck. I was browsing the python SDK's source code and found <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-python/blob/master/HubSpot/crm/contacts/models/simple_public_object_with_associations.py|an input method with associations> but couldn't find examples of how to fetch the required ids. Thanks a lot in advance :slightly_smiling_face:"
