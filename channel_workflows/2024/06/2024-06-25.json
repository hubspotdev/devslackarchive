    "text": "Hi there. Sorry if already asked, but tried to browser for our use case, but didn't see it.\n\nWe have a use case where when a user on our platform has his trial end and we deactivate their account, we would like to trigger a workflow in HubSpot.\n\nI gathered so far (let me know if a better way), that we should “create a custom event” using the custom event api and that will register in HubSpot.\nAnd if we build a workflow to trigger on that custom event it will kick off.\n\nThe part I’m trying to determine is, if we pass let’s say the user's Name and Email, how do we associate it in the workflow to a HubSpot contact?\nLike does it do associations in any way?\n\nAnd if not, can we at least pass the info for it to blindly send an email to someone that we have the email from (i.e. whether we have a contact or not)\nOr maybe even at worst, have the details passed in a note / task for an account manager to actionize some of this.\n\nThank you for any guidance you can provide",
