You could avoid this entirely by copying into a string property instead of an enumeration, but the internal values are\n• Succeeded -&gt; `SUCCESS`\n• Failed, object removed from workflow -&gt; `FAIL_IRREPARABLE`\n• Failed, object continued to next action -&gt; `FAIL_CONTINUE`\n• Skipped, action deleted or outside execution dates -&gt; `SKIPPED`\n• Partially succeeded, some objects failed -&gt; `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`"
