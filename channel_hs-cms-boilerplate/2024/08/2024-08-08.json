I get that I can't edit a core module, but on other things I can copy it to my theme folder and edit as needed.  I can't find this one in the HubSpot modules though. Are we really not allowed to modify this one to suit our needs? I was hoping to add custom css classes and even add some additional information (I'm making a podcast website and want to add the season/episode numbers). Is this not possible?",
