Am i missing something?",

A lot of gated content, use the same progressive form on all of them, but create unique landing pages and workflows to send an email with the content on form submission. Would also love to hear more efficient ways people are doing it.\n\nOne thing we've just started doing is instead of creating a separate workflow for each, have one workflow and enroll contacts based on form submission. Then the first step divide it up based on which form they submitted so we could send the email. It's the exact same amount of work, but just keeps the Workflows page a little cleaner because we have one really wide workflow for all the similar form submissions instead of individual workflows. One thing we noticed though is you can't set a condition by campaign in workflows which is very annoying.\n\nAnother workaround we did that saved us a lot of time, but won't work in most cases, is we had a dozen similar landing pages with the same form to email the gated content. We used one workflow and only one email. We did this by passing a hidden value in the form and then using this as the last part of the URL of the actual content that needed to be sent in the email. We couldn't change the language of the email for each piece of content, but they were all similar so we didn't need to. Basically the hidden field set a contact property, then in the email the link to download the content was something like `<http://path.to/file/HIDDENFIELDPROPERTY.pdf>`"
