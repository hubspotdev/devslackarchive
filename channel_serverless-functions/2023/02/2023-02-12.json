I used the cms-webpack-serverless-boilerplate and just followed the instruction in the readme. But error \"Cannot find module '@HubSpot/cms-cli/lib/prompts'\" persist. I looked at the HubSpot in the node_modules folder and it is really not there. Not sure why it's looking at this prompt. I didn't even update the files. I'm running in vscode in windows by the way."
