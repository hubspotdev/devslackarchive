A HS developer even recently stated that they have known for 3 years but that he didn’t know why it wasn’t sorted.\n\nIf i suggested this as an idea (which I have) there’s NO way it would get much interest in the upvote system. Also, many of the top ideas date back to 2017.\n\nIt’s just a poor way of prioritise what makes sense to develop honestly"
