The <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/commerce/invoices> is a read only API. Does anyone have ideas in how we can create automated invoices?\n\nIn a nutshell. We collect money for transactions, create an invoice (credit note) for this and pay out the partner through the bank.\n\nWe would want to find a way to create the invoices using HubSpot. Any thoughts?\n\nThank you :innocent:"
