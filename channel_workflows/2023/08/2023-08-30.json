    "text": "hi everyone :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n2 quick questions on Custom Code (Python) in HubSpot workflows:\n\n1) Has anyone found a simple solution to import libraries (e.g., pandas, stripe, etc.) in the custom code?\n\n2) Has anyone figured out how to return dates from a custom code and copy them to an object property?\n• I’ve tried returning both UNIX int or ISO 8601 `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` in the data outputs and then using a copy to property block in the workflow, but that always fails\n• My solution so far has been calling the HubSpot API and directly copying the date property, but it sometimes it would be much easier to just use a copy to property block\nthank you very much in advance :pray:"

    "text": "hey all, just wanted to confirm something to avoid continuing to bang my head against the wall: for Python custom code, the version of `HubSpot` available to import is not the most recent version available <https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-api-python|here>, right? I'm missing the `HubSpot.crm.associations.v4` endpoint that is mentioned in <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/associations|the official documentation>. When I iterate through the packages available in `HubSpot.crm.associations` within the custom code tool, I get:\n```['api', 'api_client', 'configuration', 'exceptions', 'models', 'rest']```\nwith `v4` noticeably absent.\n\nWhen importing `HubSpot.crm.associations.v4` I get:\n```[ERROR] Runtime.ImportModuleError: Unable to import module 'HubSpotHandler': No module named 'HubSpot.crm.associations.v4'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nMemory: 52/128 MB\nRuntime: 1.25 ms```\nThis is an issue as I want to create contact-to-contact associations, which HubSpot.crm.associations v3 doesn't support. Assume there's no way on my end to upgrade to the most recent API client version?"
