    "text": "I have an interesting problem to solve and I’m hoping some smart people here might be able to help me figure it out.\n\nRight now, I have a custom dynamic form that will produce a number of form input groups based on user input in a select input.\n\n5 = 5 form field inputs created.\n\nThis meant to provide the user with that ability to submit information to produce multiple tickets if desired.\n\nMy issue - producing a nested object based on the amount in form groups that have been filled out to send to my serverless function, that then will batch create tickets by hitting the HS Tickets API.\n\nWhat I’m working with up to this point is:\n\n  `let itemNodes [document.querySelectorAll(`[id*=\"item-info-group\"]`)]`\n  `let itemNodeArray = Array.from(itemNodes)`\n  `let elementCount = itemNodeArray.length` \n\n\nThis allows me to gather the form field elements that have been filled out. I can then target the appropriate values within each group.  It’s the object creation that is giving me issues.\n\nBased on the `elementCount`, I need to create a POST object to send to my serverless function endpoint.\n\nIf user fills out 5 field groups, I want to be able to produce something along the lines of:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n   `let postObj = { itemInfo1: {`\n`\"initial_repair_reason1\": \"initial_repair_reason1\",`\n`\"serial_number_1\": \"serial_number_1\",`\n`\"part_number1\":\"part_number1\"`\n`},`\n`itemInfo2: {`\n `\"initial_repair_reason2\": \"initial_repair_reason2\",`\n`\"serial_number_2\": \"serial_number_2\",`\n`\"part_number2\":\"part_number2\"`\n`},`\n`itemInfo3: {`\n  `\"initial_repair_reason3\": \"initial_repair_reason3\",`\n`\"serial_number_3\": \"serial_number_3\",`\n`\"part_number3\":\"part_number3\"`\n`},`\n`itemInfo4: {`\n`\"initial_repair_reason4\": \"initial_repair_reason4\",`\n`\"serial_number_4\": \"serial_number_4\",`\n`\"part_number4\":\"part_number4\"`\n `},`\n`itemInfo5: {`\n`\"initial_repair_reason5\": \"initial_repair_reason5\",`\n`\"serial_number_5\": \"serial_number_5\",`\n`\"part_number5\":\"part_number5\"`\n\t `}` \n }\n\nSorry - formatting got destroyed in the process of bringing it over, but hopefully you get the gist.\n\nI’d be eternally grateful for any smart person’s assistance."
