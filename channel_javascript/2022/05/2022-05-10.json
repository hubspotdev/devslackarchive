    "text": "I have a module with language translation files. On load, I am dynamically translating strings using the `i18n_getmessage` function. My module is a special one for internal use only so a lot of the content is hardcoded into the HTML file and I am translating it with JavaScript. If I put the module on a page with other modules from the theme on it, the module is not translating. Could this be because there are two modules with i18n implemented and the `i18n_getmessage` function may now be looking in a different spot for the translation?",
