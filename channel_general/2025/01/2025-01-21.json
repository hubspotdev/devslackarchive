Ideally, the user will be pushed to a TYP after submission that uses their submitted email to create a unique referral link that they can share. However, when I'm testing it, the email field doesnt pass through immediately, leaving the generated URL missing the \"referral_id\" field.\n\nIf I refresh the page right after, the data loads properly, but i dont know how to make it load instantly for the user. Any advice? Will buy you a coffee if you can help me solve :smiling_face_with_tear:",

    "text": "Hey <@UTRKEGMKQ>, unfortunately the only real way to disable the section settings is to not use drag&amp;drop areas/sections at all and write \"hard coded templates\"(with HS modules of course).\n\nA \"somewhat ok\" workaround could be creating a bunch of custom row modules with predefined columns and options(you can get very creative with the choice option :wink: ). This would limit the options for the module, but if an editor would click on the section in the editor (or sidebar) he'd still get the section settings.\n\nSo again - the only current solution is to not use DND - which is not an option in most cases."

But what I'm running into is that the data isnt writing to the contact record fast enough to populate that \"referred by\" field fast enough, so it's being left blank.\n\nadmittedly, this seems like something that should have a simple solution and i'm just overlooking it :sweat:",
