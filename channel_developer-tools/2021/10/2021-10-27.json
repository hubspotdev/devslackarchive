    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI created a custom integration that's using the card system.\n\nThe card generate an \"Action / iframe\" button that when clicked, call an external endpoint on my server to do an action.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nThe problem is when the Iframe is closed (either manually via the \"X\" on the HubSpot interface or using the javascript way, HubSpot send a second call to the endpoint thus doing the action twice.)\n\nHow do you prevent or at least identify which request is the original and which request is the \"Closing request\" ? I dont want the action to be done twice, only once....\n\nI tried adding a flag in the Uri of the button that opens the iframe, but that same flag is also sent when closing... basically both requests look identical and I dont seem to have a way to know which one is which (modifié)"
