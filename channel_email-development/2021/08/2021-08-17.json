What you are looking for is\n```@media (max-width: 768px) {\n  .Dubbel1,.Dubbel2, .Dubbel3, .Dubbel4 {\n    --- Styles go here ---\n  }\n}```\nJust note that media queries aren’t supported in all email clients. When it comes to styling emails keeping them basic is typically the way to go. That or using the Drag and Drop editor is a pretty good way to ensure that they are always sytled correctly.\n\nAlso worth noting that HubSpot should automatically be taking multi col layouts to a single col at 768px width on it’s own. You likely wont need to specify that"
