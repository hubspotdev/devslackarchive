    "text": "Yes, but it’s not as useful as seeing the module in the real page.\n\nIn the design manger if you open a module you can click the preview button. This creates a live updating view of the module without any styles/javascript from a page.\n\nWhen you save/upload the file the design manager preview will automatically update.\n\nThe same happens for template previews - but it doesn’t know about modules within the template changing so in that situation you’d need to manually refresh."
