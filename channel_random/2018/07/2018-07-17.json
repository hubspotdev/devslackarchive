We're looking for someone mid-level with some experience under their belt, especially if that experience is in construction, contracting, renewable energy, or related industries. Feel free to DM if you think you might know someone or have any questions, or forward them to our Indeed posting:\n\n<https://www.indeed.com/company/Illumine8-Marketing-and-PR/jobs/Marketing-Coordinator-99dfa5d445b2c1d0?fccid=aec56f7bff65219c&amp;vjs=3>\n\nThanks!"
