    "text": "Hi, y’all! I’ve reached out to Integrations Support about this issue but wondering if anyone has seen it from here. We’re using the HubSpot &lt;&gt; Shopify connector, and our deal amounts are off by multiple orders of magnitude from the Shopify amounts that we expect, e.g. a *Shopify cart with $3,495* pending is showing a deal amount of *$3,495,000,000 in HubSpot*. I would appreciate any info on this issue and also interested if anyone has come across this before. Thanks!"
