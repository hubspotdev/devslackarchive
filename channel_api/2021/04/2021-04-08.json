    "text": "Hello Folks,\nI am going to use HubSpot data in Power BI, by building some reports for Deal, Companies and Contacts objects.\nIt seems there is no power BI connector for HubSpot. Instead, I will use HubSpot API to Pull up the HubSpot data to server/local computer, then process and import the data to Power BI to build reports. Is this good idea or is there better idea somewhere that I am not aware of?",
