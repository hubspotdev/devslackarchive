    "text": "Hey! I tried creating a \"skip to content\" button in my header of my website pages, and it works by going to that anchor point in the page, but it doesn't actually skip the elements inbetween in the tab order? Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong here? I followed this tutorial: <https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-skip-to-content-link/> and here is my code:\n\n&lt;a class=\"skip-to-content-link\" href=\"#main-content\"&gt;\n  Skip to content\n&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhere \"#main-content\" is a css class that is included in the main-content element. And my CSS code looks like this:\n\n.skip-to-content-link {\n  height: 30px;\n  /*left: 50%; */\n  padding: 8px;\n  position: absolute;\n  transform: translateY(-100%);\n  transition: transform 0.3s; */\n}\n\n.skip-to-content-link:focus {\n  transform: translateY(0%);\n  color:  #FFFFFF;\n}",
