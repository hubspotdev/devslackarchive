    "text": "Hi! we just published a boilerplate for a :vuejs: *Vue.js* + typescript HubSpot module, following the great work HubSpot did with the cms-react-app. It comes with everything ready for setting up a local environment with npm, and a `docker-compose.yml` with a Makefile so you just need to run `make` to build the container and install npm packages. You can find everything at the module's github page <https://github.com/sparkfabrik/HubSpot-cms-vuejs-typescript-boilerplate>. We await your feedback!",
