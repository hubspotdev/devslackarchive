Most of the portals I'm working in have an extremely messy file/folder structure that's more apparent than ever with the new designer manager's finder. It'd be nice to have a \"clean slate\" to work with to make things easier to find. Or at least have a way to differentiate new modules from the old modules in the finder. Keep up the great work!",

Notice the quality difference between the header image and footer image? One of them was added via HubL at the template level and adding ?noresize to the end of the default url. The header image was swapped in the email editor to a different image using the image module and it clearly has lower quality. I can use that exact same header image URL at the template level as the default image and it is super crisp just like the footer image."
