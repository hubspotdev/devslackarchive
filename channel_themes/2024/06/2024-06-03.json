    "text": "<@U05RXKM45HP> - sorry for the delay.\n\nI'd say it's a bit of understanding HubSpot.\nFirst thing to check the classes - they might be written like\n`&lt;div class=\"lorem-ipsum\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;` in the template or in some module. (You can preview the template, right-click on the element and select \"inspect\")\nAfter you've found the classes look at the template. If you're seeing something like `{% _extends_ '../layouts/base.html' %}` in your template - start in this file. Check the loading of the CSS files what ever file will be loaded last, will overwrite the previous one. Most times templates might have their own CSS files attached. They're most likely will be located at the top of the file after `{% extends ... %}` like `{% set template_css = \"...\" %}` .\nSomething that is pretty common is this:\nYou're loading a main.css file in the base.html file which contains a lot of default styles that are non template-specific. Things like colors are located in the overwrite.css file. So in this case you're loading the main.css file and after that the theme-overrides.css file which will overwrite the main.css file with your desired design"
