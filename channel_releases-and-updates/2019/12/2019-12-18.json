Who is interested in utilizing version control, and wanting GitHub or otherwise to be the source of truth for their code? \n\nTo support these developer workflows, we are introducing new functionality to be able to lock folders within the Design Manager, so the files within those folders can not be edited in the app. \n\nIf you are interested in being part of this beta, simply fill out this form <https://forms.gle/wL5aohw2gqVc5zMr7>! If you have not already done so, make sure to check out the local development tooling at <https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tools/local-development> and join <#CLJJXGTC0|local-development> to provide feedback on this functionality.",
