    "text": "Hi everyone, I'm new to the HubSpot Slack. My team is developing an app, and we have a question that I could not locate in the forums.\nWe want the tool to be available to other users, so we are going forward with the *app* option.\n\nCan anyone clarify, is it possible to build an integration of our tool (\"XY\") *within the HubSport CRM user interface*?\n\nFor example, I am in the Company CRM page within HubSpot. I then launch the XY app (without leaving that page), call our API, get enriched data, and the same Company CRM page gets refreshed with new data/properties.\n\nIs this possible at all? Or does the user have to leave the HubSpot CRM, go to the \"X\" platform, do all the actions there, and then all new information gets pushed to HubSpot?\n\nI'd appreciate any guidance on this, or if you've seen any similar apps/tools that did it."
