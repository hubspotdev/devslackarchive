    "text": "I have a seemingly simple to solve issue, but for some reason, I can't figure it out.\n\nI'm working on this page: <https://www-airsquirrels-com.sandbox.hs-sites.com/reflector/director?hs_preview=ghyxIpwc-48585141100>\n\nAnd in the second section, I have 5 images. One of the images - the one above Manage Connect Devices has a shadow on the png file itself, it's not created with CSS.\n\nBecause of that the shadow is taking up space in the div and making the image appear smaller than the others.\n\nAny idea how I can size the images similar to the others even though it has a shadow on it?\n\nI thought about just asking for the image without the shad and then adding it via CSS but had a hunch I'm just overlooking something that may be a simpler solution.",
