    "text": "i think it would be good to be able to limit the view of the modules an editor can choose in the page editor! For example, if more than one version of a theme is installed then we would like to be able to limit the editor to only choose modules from the newest version of the theme.  So if there are \"old  modules\" then they could confuse them with the new ones with better functionality.  Granted, this can be done with naming them correctly, but i guess it would be \"foolproof\" if one can only choose from a certain set of modules.",
