When I use Google's Rich Results Test (<https://search.google.com/test/rich-results>) I get as `{{ request.headers }}` something like:\n```{x-hs-smart-content-ip=<http://XXX.XXX.XX.XXX|XXX.XXX.XX.XXX>, user-agent=CosIndex PreRendering HubSpot bot}```\nWhat is that `user-agent`?\nAdditionally, `{{ request.remote_ip }}` I get does not seem to be from Google (when it should I believe).\nJuas as additional information, I am not trying to do cloaking, I created a paywalled (softwall in reality) template and I am trying to tell google that the content is paywalled and also to get the paywalled content indexed adding structured data as explained in here: <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7532484>"
