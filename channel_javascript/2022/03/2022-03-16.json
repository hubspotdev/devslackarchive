My initial idea was to use Google Optimize, but then I realized the HubSpot CTAs allow for this kind of testing. My question is, how can I embed HS CTA into our gatbsy app? I dont think the regular embed code is workable?",

    "text": "Hey Mark (nice name ya got there), you’re correct, for a Gatsby site I would recommend using HubSpot’s tool over Google Optimize. The embed code will need to be adjusted a bit. Something like this in JSX:\n\n```&lt;!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --&gt;\n&lt;span className=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-53905a89-6876-4a47-a531-fa13df408317\"&gt;\n  &lt;span className=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-53905a89-6876-4a47-a531-fa13df408317\" id=\"hs-cta-53905a89-6876-4a47-a531-fa13df408317\"&gt;\n    &lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;\n      &lt;div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;![endif]--&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"<https://cta-redirect.HubSpot.com/cta/redirect/21043808/53905a89-6876-4a47-a531-fa13df408317>\" &gt;\n      &lt;img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-53905a89-6876-4a47-a531-fa13df408317\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" src=\"<https://no-cache.HubSpot.com/cta/default/21043808/53905a89-6876-4a47-a531-fa13df408317.png>\" alt=\"New call-to-action\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --&gt;```\nThen you also need to add the two script elements as well. `current.js` can be added to the head, but the function should be added to the footer to ensure it does not fire until the placeholder elements above are on the page before execution. Here are a few tutorials to inject those lines: <https://cesarvarela.com/blog/how-to-include-javascript-files-in-gatsby> <https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/custom-html/>"
