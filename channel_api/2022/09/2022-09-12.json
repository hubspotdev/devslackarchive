For existing contacts, the contact ID is also unique and will deduplicate contacts. To update a contact via the API, you can use either the contact ID or the contact's email.\nThe `idProperty` query parameter doesn't appear on the _Endpoints_ tab due to technical limitations, but it can be used for contacts exclusively with `email`. To use an email address as the unique identifier, set the `idProperty` as `email` and enter the email address in place of the contact ID. This should be set as a query parameter rather than added to the request body.\""

The only thing I can think of is that the User-Agent may not be set in the RestSharp client appropriately (though I do not know if that's necessary), which I imagine could cause the calls to appear to be from a bot on HubSpot's end.\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts here I'd appreciate the input - thank you!",
