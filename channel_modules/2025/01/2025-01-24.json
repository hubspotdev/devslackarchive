This is caused by the header (or other elements above the element you're editing) if it has something like position:fixed in the code.\nIf you figure out which element is responsible for this, you can modify the CSS like this(just some example css):\n\n```.header{\nwidth:100%;\nheight:60px;\n{% unless is_in_page_editor %} {# will apply the following CSS rules only in page editors #}\nposition:fixed;\n{% else %}\nposition:inherit;\n{% endif %}\n...\n}```"
