    "text": "I'm super confused. HubSpot service desk tightly integrates with CES surveys and there are a number of custom fields created by HubSpot for the purpose of knowing the last feedback status and date related to CES.... but the service analytics only shows CSAT analytics (which is kind of pointless since CSAT is not triggered by tickets nor does it reflect effort for support teams).\n\nAm I misunderstanding something fundamental, or did the team at HubSpot responsible for service analytics mess up and accidentally reference the wrong type of survey?"
