    "text": "A way for marketers to set module defaults globally right in the module on the page editor, without having to mess with stuff in the design manager. i.e. if there is a card module that has a border radius style field, I think they should be able to change the default border radius in that module to 10px \"globally\" right there in the module somehow. So any time they use that module in the future, it will use their \"global defaults.\" We can just set up field groups in the global theme settings for modules for this and inherit the values into the module, but it's a lot more work and seems a little unintuitive having them separated like that to me, coupled with the fact it relies on developers to implement it, which will also cause inconsistency with how and if it's implemented."
