    "text": "A customer is trying to migrate from Spotler to HS. But he runs into problems\n\n```I do run into a bit of a problem with the fact that we have so many variables that we can now just throw in freely in Spotler, but in HS a variable has to be predefined for each value, in eg Contact or Company. That doesn't feel right.\n\nI tried to add a text field \"blob\" (short for binary large object) in a Contact. The idea was to pop in a bit of data which we can then apply in the mails, that seemed like a very clear and nice idea, but unfortunately HubSpot makes this impossible in the mails; the field will be replaced in it later so I can't do any edits to it in the form of HuBL (HubSpot Language) edits...that took me some time.\n\nFor the mail to, for example, I can think of something that we pre-format an HTML block with all the data in it and post this value in a Contact variable via the API, but that really feels like a setback compared to Spotler.```\nAnyone got some ideas on this matter?",
