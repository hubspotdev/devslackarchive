    "text": ":question: Has anyone used HubSpot in this capacity before?\n\nIâ€™m helping a B2B2C SaaS client setup a workflow that allows us to create a new sender email for Company X so that we can send emails on their behalf to their clients. Sender email would still be @ourcompany.com, not <http://companyx.com|companyx.com>.\n\nI believe we can do this manually by adding a new HubSpot user (<mailto:joe@ourcompany.com|joe@ourcompany.com>) for each company we onboard and select them as the sender when crafting emails and workflows but is there a better, more streamlined way using custom fields or something else? We have a dev team that can help implement so tech roadblocks if the solution is custom code."
