    "text": "Hey Michael, obviously I already replied in the forums, but with the additional context you’ve provided here, I’d suggest reevaluating your approach. While there is some overlap, React components and HubSpot modules should not be (and in some cases CAN not be) used the same way. For example, HubSpot modules can not contain other modules nested within themselves, so parent/child component relationships are not possible. In general, best practice is to use React or other frameworks on HubSpot where it makes sense to do so: calculators, interactive experiences, dealing with and rendering views via dynamic data from an API… and keep more standard modules built in lightweight html, css and vanilla js (if needed)."
