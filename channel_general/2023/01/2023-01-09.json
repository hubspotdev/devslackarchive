One thing that I was wondering, it looks like your trials might have already expired -- that could be why you're having trouble renewing them for this portal under your developer test account.\n\nIf you could, I would reach out to HubSpot support for assistance with this one, unless you want to try again 24 hours after you got that message.\n\nSorry for being of limited help here -- I do work here at HubSpot, but I would encourage you to contact Support for this kind of issue (I'm not quite the right kind of person to help with this one, but they should be able to give you a hand)."
