For one of my CRM Extensions, the Serverless function was working fine before, but is now throwing a \"[missing “nl.middlePane.errorCategories.undefined” translation]\" error. I kinda get that it's missing a Dutch translation somewhere, but not sure how or where to add this (in the serverless function or within the React Card). Can't find anything in the docs either. Any clue?",
