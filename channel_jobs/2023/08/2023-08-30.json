    "text": "For integrations like this I recommend using Make over Zapier if you are not doing custom coded actions. Easier maintenance, better error handling, more visual, not a super slow UI, enables more complex pathing if needed. For contacts the key should be the email and for companies you can use domain. If you are afraid it can create duplicates you may want to add a \"verification step\" for users or however you prefer. After that process the joinable key should be put on the record if you want to sync data bi-directionally or workaround the verification in the future"
