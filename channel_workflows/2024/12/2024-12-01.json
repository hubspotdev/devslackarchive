    "text": "Hi Jon, there isnâ€™t anything out of the box. I would use a couple of workflows to do this:\n1. As soon as the contact owner is set - I enroll them in a workflow to set the owners number to a custom phone property as well as slack id so I can tag them as secondary notifications. This sets the ground work for using a designed property at a later date\n2. we also use twilio so I would use a custom code action to send them an sms via this action and use the phone number property set in point one to send the sms to.\nI hope this helps\n\n"
