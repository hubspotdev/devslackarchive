    "text": "*— Security Header HubSpot Question ---*\nHey team, I looking for some clarification/sanity check. I was auditing some site security and in particular, `Content-Security-Policy`  Within the `settings&gt;website&gt;domains &amp; urls` under “edit” we can edit the domain security settings “Security headers”. :point_down: It is my understanding that if I enable this setting it defaults to the security policy in the field and when I inspect the given domain I should see a corresponding similar to this :point_down:\n```&lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"\"default-src 'self'\" &gt;```\nBut when I inspect a given site I don’t find said meta. I have checked a few domains we manage. Please let me know if and where I am misunderstanding this. Thanks in advance for anyone who can help.",
