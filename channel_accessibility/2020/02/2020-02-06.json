    "text": "Hi <@ULBP4M3LK> I wanted to chime in on your message here.\n\nActually you can do this with drag and drop templates using the `wrapping HTML` field. You can do this with groups, flex columns or individual modules that are not inside of a flex column.\n\nModules inside of a flex column or dnd_area should be coded to meet A11y standards on their own, as the user dictates where they are placed.\n\nAs was previously stated, coded templates provide the greatest level of control over the code.\n\nIf you have existing drag and drop design manager templates that youâ€™d like to gain full control over their code, you could clone the template to html, by right clicking it in the design manager. You would then need to swap pages to use that new template for your code changes to take effect."
