    "text": "If you’re on HubSpot Enterprise, using Content Partitioning combined with multi-language support within the same account would likely be the most efficient solution. This allows for centralized management with localized flexibility and doesn’t require custom development. If you’re on a lower HubSpot plan or require fully separate accounts, consider the cloning and customising pages per country. \n\nHowever, the most relevant solution will depend on your setup, resources, and the level of customization needed. Will be happy to chat more tomorrow! "
