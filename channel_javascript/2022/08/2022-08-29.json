If you are doing a normal wordpress install, — you should have your tracking code so that it loads on each page. you can look in the console to see if there are any javascript errors. The tracking code itself should send page views to your hubpsot.\n\nonly page views where HubSpot knows who the person is are going to be tracked. They are tracked to a cookie. Those views won’t show up in your HubSpot until they are associated with a contact (generally this means a form fill!) — once a form fill happens, then this data is figured out in HubSpot contact timeline."
