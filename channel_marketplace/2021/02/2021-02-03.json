If you have something ready to go, I certainly don't want to hold you back from getting this listed. If you're ready to list it in the next few weeks, let me know and I'll connect you with an app partner manager. If the app is still in development and you are OK going live in a few months, let me know and we'll get you involved in the Accelerator."
