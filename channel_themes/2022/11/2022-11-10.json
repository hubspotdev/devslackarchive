Is it contained in theme_name/templates/this_file or is it contained in theme_name/templates/another_folder/this_file\n\nIf it's the former I'd recommend submitting a support ticket as that looks incorrect, if it's the latter, I'd try adding an additional ../\n\nSo you'd have `../../modules/impressa-footer-copyright.module`\n\n More on this here <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/modules/using-modules-in-templates#basic-module-syntax>"
