I'm wondering if anyone more knowledgeable of HubSpot would know an answer to something I've been trying to wrap my head around.\n\nI'm in the process of building a custom form that needs to send a HTTP request to a server before determining whether the form submission should be considered successful or not:\n\nA) If the HTTP server responds with an error, I should display an error in the UI.\nB) If the HTTP server responds with a success, I should redirect the user immediately to a specific URL.\n\nAt first I thought about creating a HubSpot Module with hard-coded HTML and JS to achieve this, but I ran into some issues with CORS that I'd like to bypass by making the request through a proxy.\n\nIt was suggested that perhaps a HubSpot Workflow could help here, but I'm at a loss about whether that's actually possible. I need to update the browser UI based on the results of the HTTP request, and I'm not sure if a Workflow can return data to the browser after it has finished running.\n\n*Can the web browser instance that triggers a form submission receive the outputs of a Workflow when the form is submitted, or is it already too late at that point?*",

Not sure though if you are running any analytics for these conversions or so."

I know I can use a proxy server to perform this (have a non-browser client send the request for me), but I'd rather avoid that if possible.\n\nThat's why I was wondering if I could somehow use HubSpot Workflows as such a \"proxy\", as they are run in AWS Lambdas. However, I'm not sure if I can somehow trigger a HubSpot Workflow from start to finish &amp; return the results of that Workflow to the browser. That's basically the big question -- can this be done? My current understanding says \"no\", because afaik there's nothing that allows me to \"talk\" directly to a Workflow from within the browser."
