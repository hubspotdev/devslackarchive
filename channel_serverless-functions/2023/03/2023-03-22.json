    "text": "Hi there, The last thread about CORS is from last year, but I got a question:\n\nThe HubSpot doc says that requests need to be done from the same origin, something is weird is happening for me:\n\n• I have a serverless function at <http://test1.mydomain.com|test1.mydomain.com>\n• When I do a request to that endpoint from <http://test2.mydomain.com|test2.mydomain.com>, I get the CORS error\n• But when I do a request to that endpoint from Postman, it works!\nWhy does it work from Postman but not from another subdomain? I mean, if it's a CORS thing, it shouldn't work on Postman either, no?",
