You  also can get the date of the form submission from the HubSpot properties. So maybe there is no need for a javascript solution here."

    "text": "Thanks <@UK9BKNBD5>! I did explore using a workflow, however I hit a limitation because we use this same checkbox field on multiple forms, and I want to trigger an action when someone checks the checkbox, irrespective of whether they have checked it in the past. I could not find a way around that with workflows, but perhaps I'm missing something?"

And _free_trial_ is _true_. Do your Action and as the last step set _free_trail_ to _false_ in the same workflow. Next time the contact filled the form and not checked the input, the workflow will not be triggered.\n\n\nAnd if you want to know if the contact already requested a _free_trail_ put him on a list. You can use that list as well in the workflow as a criteria. Maybe in a  _if/else_ way to tell the contact via auto. mail that he already have a _free_trail_. And if you want to know the _free_trial_requested_date_, you can set it to the form submission date via workflow or go with the hidden JS field."
