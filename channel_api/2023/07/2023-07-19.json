    "text": "Hello I am trying to use the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/crm/feedback-submissions|feedback submissions API>, which I see is in beta. I am confused though because it says on the page:\n&gt; Please note: the feedback submissions endpoints are currently read only. Feedback submissions cannot be submitted or edited through the API.\nHowever the endpoints list a `create` endpoint. I tried the `create` endpoint with the scopes listed in the documentation `crm.objects.contacts.write` and I get an error:\n\n`Object type FEEDBACK_SUBMISSION is not supported by this endpoint`\n\nWhen I try the list endpoint with the scopes listed in the documentation `crm.objects.contacts.read` I get the following error:\n\n`This app hasn't been granted all required scopes to make this call`\n\nIt looks like the scopes listed in the documentation are wrong since a scope exists for `crm.objects.feedback_submissions.read` and with it enabled there is no error for the list endpoint.\n\nIn that case I am assuming the documentation is also wrong for the scopes listed on the create endpoint and wrong in listing the endpoint in the first place since it isn’t available and the `write` scopes do not exist.\n\nCan anyone confirm this or does anyone have any further information on the status of this API and how to actually use it? Any help is greatly appreciated."
