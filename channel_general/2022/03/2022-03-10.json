I have a fairly large amount of records to bring over to HubSpot, just wondering if there are any things to \"watch out for\" or if its a fairly painless process? Thanks in advance and apologies if this is in the incorrect Channel! Thanks, Rob"

We have an existing external system that houses staff members and their details, and exposes them in a json feed. I would like to build an import process to pull this content into HubDB on a regular basis. I'm thinking this could be a process that runs nightly, but manually kicking off the process would work too. Once imported, I envision a module that would allow editors to curate staff lists for display on a HubSpot CMS page, so existing rows would need to be updated in HubDB, not deleted and re-added on each import. Has anyone done this type of thing? Thanks!"

I've done some research on here but can't really find a answer.\n\nHere's what I got:\n$time = 1632182399;\n\nI had did some research and found a contributor had suggested this solution: <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Update-Custom-Date-Picker-in-Deals-through-the-AP><https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/APIs-Integrations/Update-Custom-Date-Picker-in-Deals-through-the-API/m-p/229499|...>\nBut this doesn't actually work and I don't know why.\n```\nfunction get_time_for_HubSpot($time){\n    $date = new DateTime();\n    $date-&gt;setTimestamp($time);\n    return gmdate('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime($date-&gt;format('Y-m-d H:i:s')));\n}\n\n // Time Stamps\n    $starttime = strval($booking_object-&gt;start);\n\n    $endtime = strval($booking_object-&gt;end);\n\n    $starttime = get_time_for_HubSpot($starttime);\n    $endtime = get_time_for_HubSpot($endtime);```\nWhich produces:\n$starttime = 2021-09-13 00:00:00\n$endtime = 2021-09-13 23:59:59\n\nSo I think i'm just missing a final step or something.
