If you wish to create a three column grid, please use your own CSS to accomplish this so that the module works in the preview.\" But I generally use HubSpot grid classes like \"span4, span6\" to achieve the results in my design and that modules got approved and works fine. And as far as I know, HubSpot has disabled the preview option on marketplace. What shall I do? Do I really need to write css classes to achieve grid structure?",
