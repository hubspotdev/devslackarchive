When previewing or sending a test email as a contact, or when performing a manual send, all of the personalization tokens fill just fine. However, when sending the email from an automation, the `company` property always returns a null value.\n\nHas anyone had an issue with `company` personalization tokens not filling in automated/workflow-triggered emails, or have any advice as to how I might be able to get it to fill? Thanks!"
