    "text": "Hey Jared — You can tie them into the HubSpot settings if you wish. However some clients prefer/find it easier to manage all web related content on webpages themself. So for that reason it might be better just to bake them into fields on the modules themselves.\n\nThis also makes it easier if your site is multilingual. Simply create a new language vairant and swap out the addresses etc. No need to build more complicated logic like you would need if you are using the address settings in HS."
