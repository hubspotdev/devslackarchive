    "text": "A while back I was asking about the problem of not being able to create private files via the API for deals, when the same API seems to be used in the CRM’s UI.\n\nIIRC, I was told something special happens somewhere along the way for files added via the UI. This is a frustrating limitation, but it seems like there are bigger, underlying security issues around the marketing file manager and CRM file attachments sharing the same code path.\n\nFor example, if you drag a file into a note on a deal, it’s routed to the marketing file manager and publicly available on the CDN. It’s hard to imagine a scenario where you’d want any file associated with a deal available to anyone who possesses (or discovers) the URL. There also might’ve been situations where this happened with files that our sales team attached via the Upload File button in the deal sidebar (HubSpot Support is looking into this, I can provide the ticket number if that’s helpful).\n\nAnyhow, given the limitations it imposes on the integration side of things and the security risks it imposes on the user side of things, is this approach to handling files something your team is looking into changing?"
