Also as a workaround can be a list of contacts from a workflow but I couldn't find a way to get the Companies enrolled to a workflow.\n\nHas anyone tried already? Is that API available from an external service based on OAuth or Token? Are there any other solutions that someone knows?\n\nThank you.",
