    "text": "Hi all, I know I am missing something obvious here, so thanks for the help! I have a db with \"Location\" set as a Select field. I'd like to display all the rows that fall under each location, while just displaying the location once. I've been able to do it by manually calling each individual location, but as soon as our client adds another location that is no longer a good solution, so I am trying to get it to dynamically show each Location. Example of what it looks like (don't mind the styling) - <http://carpentertechnology-7407324.hs-sites.com/?hs_preview=MNevbCIU-34511351096>"
