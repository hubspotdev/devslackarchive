    "text": "How would you guys/gals recommend handling 2 openIframeModal calls? The first one is obvious, but when it comes to the second I have to wait for specific data to be processed before that modal automatically opens. I can't prevent them from closing out the first iframe until the data has been inserted into a HubSpot property that's required for the second iframe to load, so that's out of the question. Not sure what the best way to handle this one is.\n\nSo a custom form is submitted which exists as a card\nWhile that's submitting, the first iframe opens which has a sales rep schedule a meeting\nOnce the meeting is scheduled, they close that iframe.\nIf they waited long enough to close the iframe, then the second iframe should open right up.\nIf they closed the first iframe to quickly while data is being submitted via the API through a serverless function in the background, then the iframe can't be opened because I can't construct the URL yet."
