For strictly decorative images, you can avoid LCP issues by setting them as CSS background images, since those aren’t a “replaced” element and won’t re-trigger the LCP timer. Just make sure you’re not sacrificing accessibility for lighthouse score!\n\nOther things that might be causing a delayed LCP:\n• Is the element animated? The LCP timer will keep re-triggering until that animation is completed.\n• Is something else earlier in the page render causing the delay? The image itself might not be the problem, it might just be the last thing that’s getting recorded. Time spent on render-blocking CSS or scripts will be accounted for in your LCP time, if they’re pushing back the render of the image.\n• Do you have any layout shift happening? If the image gets shifted by another element, that would cause it to re-paint, and re-trigger the LCP timer."

Then, you can create your own Form module that loads the forms script package, but has the “defer” attribute set on the script tag. You can then use the v2.js API to initialize any forms on the page.\n\nA bit of a pain, but it’s doable!"
