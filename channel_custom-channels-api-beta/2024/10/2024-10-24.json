    "text": "Thank you, Eric for your prompt and clear reply - very useful! Thank you for explaining that this is actually how the Facebook integration work, so I know its a normal/expected behavior for HS agents to manually attach their contacts. A bit of a follow up:\n\n> _for all subsequent_ conversations initiated by that same contact, _automatic contact association *will* work_\nThis is indeed the behavior I noticed. I also noticed a bit of merging happening in the contact timeline. I understand currently there is no way for contacts to automatically associate with a visitor via the opaque ID, nor a conversation API endpoint to attach a conversation to a contact. Are any of those features on the roadmap to development? - Thank you again :raised_hands::skin-tone-4:"
