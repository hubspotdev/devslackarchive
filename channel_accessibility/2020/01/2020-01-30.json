I try to use 2-3 different evaluators, but it can be very difficult to catch and fix every single tiny issue flagged (and I would argue some are truly not an issue, but how does that actually stand up legally?). This is partially why I was wondering what tools everyone is using - I am looking for something that is more comprehensive. Between performance, usability, maintainability, and legal issues development is much more complex than it was 10 years ago."
