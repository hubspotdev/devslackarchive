    "text": "I actually found a API that could be used for 3D models, Its called <https://sketchfab.com/developers/viewer|SketchFab>, the viewer script requires certain permissions from HubSpot in order for it to work. Is something that I can configure to allow?\n\nNOTE: In order to load correctly, the Sketchfab viewer must run various scripts, access browser cookies, and make requests to other resources on Sketchfab’s servers. If your website sandboxes iframes for security purposes, you must lift certain restrictions. This is very common in various WordPress configurations, for example. To ensure all viewer features function correctly, and to abide by our terms of use, you should include the following values in the `sandbox` attribute:\n• `allow-scripts`\n• `allow-same-origin`\n• `allow-popups`\n• `allow-forms`\n"
