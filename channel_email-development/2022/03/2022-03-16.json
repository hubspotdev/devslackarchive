    "text": "Hi all,  Great Question from one new client.  GDPR in HubSpot and how it works. So looks-like that in a case where you have external forms. a Contact decides to unsubscribe from you. days-weeks later. The same contact fill-a newsletter form ( again non HubSpot Form).  Your integration with HubSpot is based in API-call after form is submited.  It looks like you can re-join the contact permisions. Is it right? and if yes are there any walk arround or best practiques to integrate vía API this re-join request? thanks!!",
