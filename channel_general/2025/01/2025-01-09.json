I'm using this formula:\n\nright(cut(cut(cut(cut(cut(trim([enrolled_<http://object.phone/|object.phone>]), \"(\") \")\"), \"*\"), \"#\"), \"+\"), 12)\n\nI'm getting this issue:\n\n1. There was a problem with your formula. We were expecting a valid function or value expression but found `\"` instead.\nIt looks like I have to escape the \"(\" and \")\" but I can't seem to do it, is there a way to do this?",
