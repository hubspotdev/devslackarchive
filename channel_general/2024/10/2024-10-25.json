I found some old posts which tell me this should work and push to the dataLayer and tracked tracked by Tagmanager/GA4 but it doesn't seem to do anything (even tried swapping out the dataLayer stuff for a simple console.log, but again nothing).\n\n&gt; &lt;script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"&lt;//js-eu1.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js&gt;\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&gt; &lt;script&gt;\n&gt;  hbspt.forms.create({\n&gt;  region: \"eu1\",\n&gt;  portalId: \"_OUR-PORTAL-ID_\",\n&gt;  formId: \"_OUR-FORM-ID_\",\n&gt;  onFormSubmitted: function($form) { window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; window.dataLayer.push({event: 'HubSpotFormSubmitted', currentUrl: window.location.href, }}\n&gt;  });\n&gt; &lt;/script&gt;\nAny idea what I'm doing wrong?"

Looking for a bit of guidance on our process here.\nWe're a fairly small partner agency and we're creating websites using the Content Hub builder and various marketplace themes (mostly CLEAN and Sprocket Rocket). The problem that we're running into is that we're starting from scratch on each website and repeating a lot of the same work. Is there a recommended way for us to create a few site templates (maybe in our demo portal) then just upload them to client portals and finish them out there? I feel like we could be saving ourselves a ton of time and effort, but we're not web-devs by trade so this isn't something we have much experience with. Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you!",

And if so, how do I work around that without duplicating the email and creating a second branch in a workflow responsible for doing the sending? Is it not possible to send a marketing email to someone as long as they are subscribed to any _one list?_",
