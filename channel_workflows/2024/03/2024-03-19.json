    "text": "Hi everyone :slightly_smiling_face: Happy Tuesday. I am currently trying to run a contact deduplication custom coded workflow that will dedup contacts if they\n1. share the same first name, last name, and phone OR \n2. if they share the same first name, last name, and job title\nSeems like the dedup function is working, but the issue I'm running into is that this needs to be ran against 23k contacts (historical deduplication), and I keep running into rate limit errors.\n\nI have a few checks in the code to see if error 429 happens and if so, to delay and try again. I also have an output field \"RateLimit\" so if error 429 happens, it sets RateLimit to YES - and I have a branch in the workflow that will branch if workflow output ratelimit = yes, wait 2 mins, and try the code again. Not sure what I'm doing wrong but 1. I don't think the code's timeout function is working 2. I don't think the branch based on output fields is working.\n\nIt's quite long so I didn't want to paste here, here it my code - <https://github.com/tomieaoba/loriauna/blob/main/hsddup>\n\nAppreciate the help for this noob :pleading_face: :pray:",
