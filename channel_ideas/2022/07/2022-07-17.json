Until then here's a possible workaround:\nCreate a meeting, drop the embed-code into your layout, (if not already created) create a url column in your HubDB, paste just the link (not the whole embed code) into it, replace the url part of the embed code in your layout with the HubDB column Hubl \n\n"
