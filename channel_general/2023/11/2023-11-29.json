I have successfully set up tracking in GTM and while I can use URL or Form ID to include/exclude forms, I'm looking for something a little lower maintenance.\n\nI noticed that the form ID is currently located in the embed script, however I am wondering if it would be possible to also add a form class?\n\nIf I were to manually type this in, would it work or would it prevent the form from loading?\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions how to achieve this?\n\nThanks in advance"
