    "text": "Hi! I am looking for a way to add a search bar on the blog page of our client. Now we have found the site search like this example on themeforest: <https://preview.themeforest.net/item/melinda-multipurpose-HubSpot-theme/full_screen_preview/32641674?_ga=2.161742911.2043886546.1655898058-256269362.1653036034|https://preview.themeforest.net/item/melinda-multipurpose-HubSpot-theme/full_screen_prev[â€¦]ga=2.161742911.2043886546.1655898058-256269362.1653036034>. But that is not exactly what we are looking for..\n\nWe are not looking for a site search but just a search bar that is searching between the blogs. Here an example of the search bar we want: <https://saysimple.com/resources/blog/>. (this example is not on HubSpot CMS)\n\nHas anyone experience with something like this? Or some documentation about this? Thanks!",
