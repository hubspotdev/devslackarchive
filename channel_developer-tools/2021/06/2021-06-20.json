    "text": "Hi! :wave: I have been working on StackGo, a tool to help make getting started with SaaS integrations much simpler. It does that by providing managed oAuth infrastructure for connections to 3rd party SaaS platforms (including HubSpot). Please :pray: provide me with some feedback on our offering.\n\nWe take the pain of spending hours of your time on understanding/implementing each oAuth system, storing tokens, refreshing strategies and having to undertake each integration individually. We do this by being a trusted secrets vault provider and proxy for your app. So you are free to focus on building your app and not on auth.\n\nWe want to make it super easy for devs to build multiple oAuth based connections for their apps and would love any feedback or queries on our offering. Please sound off in the comments, or feel free to PM me.For more info please, check out our <https://docs.stackgo.io/docs/stackgo-docs/docs/Docs%20Home.md#technical-architecture-high-level|docs> and <https://www.npmjs.com/package/stackgo-js-sdk|SDK>."
