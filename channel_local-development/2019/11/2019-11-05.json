    "text": "Hi all,\nI need a help while setting up the local-dev-beta. I have downloaded a HubSpot code from the git and want to push it on my sandbox HubSpot account. While uploading the files using the following command\n\"npx hs upload --mode=draft cms-project cms-project\"\n\nSome of the files are uploaded successfully, but for some files I got following errors:\n[Error] Failed to upload file '/project/README.md'. Portal 123 does not have access to raw assets.\n[ERROR] line 18: Could not resolve function 'icon_arrow'\n\nThen I come to know that there is some path issue. In html file, there is some absolute path. I have tried to update one of the path. then I got following error\n[ERROR] A RangeError has occurred. path should be a `path.relative()`d string, but got \"..\"\n\nNow I have reverted the path still getting RangeError. Can anyone assist me on this.\n\nThanks",
