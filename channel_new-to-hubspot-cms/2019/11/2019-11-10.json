You can use the <#CLJJXGTC0|local-development> tools to integrate scss and javascript bundlers/compilers.\n\n<https://designers.HubSpot.com/docs/tools/local-development>\n\nFor a lot of SCSS functionality there is actually a way to do it with HubL.\n\nThere’s also the concept of how HubSpot modules work, if css is tied to a module it’s better for it to be in the module itself. Enabling HubSpot to do the minification and combination for you."
