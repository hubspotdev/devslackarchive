    "text": "Approximately 2 weeks ago, some of our fields.json fields stopped holding values. Specifically, where we set the sizes of images to use at certain breakpoints in fields.json. Previously, accessing those values from within our custom modules worked correctly. Then, suddenly approx 2 weeks ago, the values all come empty.  And, we didn't make any changes on the site during the time that these stopped working. Does anyone know if some kind of HubSpot update might have affected this? And, if so, how to fix it? My current _temporary_ solution is to just hard-code the image sizes in our custom module. But, ideally, we want the fields in fields.json to work correctly like they did previously. We are using a copy of POWER theme (not a child theme).",
