    "text": "Hi there! Another HubSpot accessibility question. From my research and a 2018 KB post, it appears that the default HubSpot video embeds to not have ANY level of WCAG conformance as they don’t support close captioning at a minimum for WCAG A.  For accessibility conformance it appears they’re pointing towards either using a 3rd party embed that is conformant or using HubSpot + Vidyard which can achieve WCAG A conformance with default settings and AA with some tweaking. Does anyone have any resources on accessible video content within HubSpot?  Google has turned up only light info.  Thank you!"
