We have a video library created (<https://info.marymount.edu/video-library?design>) that lets you add a parameter to load a specific video by default in the main section. clicking on that link will load the correct video thumbnail and src URL, but when you play or if you download the video, it will use a different video, even though the src URL is correct (and different). Does anyone know why this might be happening? All the video thumbnails and src URLS are being changed using JS and HubL",
