    "text": "Hi all, I’m new to HubSpot (and web programming in general) and trying to learn more about what HubSpot does with ad attribution data, and how I can pass along that data to another site on my domain that’s outside of HubSpot. For example:\n\n1. User clicks an ad: <https://www.mysite.com/?utm_tag=tagdata>\n2. User navigates around the site, URL parameters are stripped and stored as a cookie? (what is the specification here?)\n3. When User clicks through to an application hosted on another platform (ie, <https://application.mysite.com/>), I want to pass along all of that attribution data to the new application in an API call, instead of as a URL query parameter, and I’m curious to know how I can recover it\nThanks in advance!"
