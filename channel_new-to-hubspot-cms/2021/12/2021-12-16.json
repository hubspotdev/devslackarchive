    "text": "I asked these same questions and got these answers.\n1. You can set a price. It just means HubSpot employees can download your theme for free to review it. But once it is officially published it will be for purchase.\n2. That is correct and what I am doing to give me time to work on devpost description and video. After you submit to asset marketplace DM Nick Laporte and let him know your recent theme submission is for the contest and it will be flagged as such."
