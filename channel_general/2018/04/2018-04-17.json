There may even be some css limitations(not sure). \n\nIf you want to fully amp a site, a lot of care and attention to detail should go into it to replace content with amp equivalents if possible.\n\nFor example say your homepage has a slider, an amp plugin may not interpret your slider is a slider and will just leave that out of the amp version of the page.\n\nIt’s largely intended for use for articles/blog posts. These pieces of content are generally simpler and don’t get too crazy.\n\nFor HS to add this to pages they’d essentially have to make an amp page builder.(more complex than with blog posts)"
