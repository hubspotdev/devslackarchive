    "text": "Hi <@U058XK120QH> Snippets are saved pieces of copy that are helpful to use in note taking. For example, we use snippets to take notes during discovery calls. The difference between a snippet and a template is a template is always saved in the form of an email with a subject line but a snippet can be whatever you write. When you save a snippet you'll give it a name as well as a #\"name that you come up with\" this makes it so you can type a # anywhere and add you snippet, to a note, deal, email, etc."
