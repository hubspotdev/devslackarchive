    "text": "Hey Fritz, working on this also, I've found it's easier to house all of your custom modules and translate that data into the relevant template provided e.g. if it's a module it has the HTML + HUBL area, followed by the CSS / JS areas, this can be achieved pretty easily, meaning you can almost build out your modules in a VUE style template or alternatively you can use Svelte (which I'm currently working with to integrate :)"
