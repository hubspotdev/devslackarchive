I’m not sure if this is the best channel to post this question, but if I’m not in the right channel, let me know.\n\nI’m trying to implement an external API into HubSpot and I don’t know which is the best way or where to keep an API key in a safe environment. I’ve been reading having a environment variable with node.js but I don’t know where to start with HubSpot.\n\nI’ll appreciate any useful links or suggestions related to this :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks a lot!",
