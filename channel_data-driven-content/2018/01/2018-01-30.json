    "text": "Alright... next question.  I'm wondering if it would be possible to create multiple dynamic pages from the same HUBDB.  Here's the use case I'm looking at:\n\nClient is a wedding business.  They have a listing of wedding venues they work with that includes a .pdf file of the venue floor plan and they want that floor plan to be gated.  I want to use the HUBDB to create a website page for each venue, a landing page with a form for each venue, and then a thank you page with the floor plan .pdf for after a user has submitted the landing page form.\n\nThink this could all be done from one DB?"
