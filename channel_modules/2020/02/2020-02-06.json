    "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI had created a custom *Global Modules* which contains a Loop. Now I have to add an aditionnal Text field in this loop. The problem is this new field doesn’t display, as if the adding of the Text field was not taken into account by the global module. I specify that it's the same for all the other fields.\nThe code is good, it’s just a simple loop like this \n\n`{% for item in module.global_module %}`\n\t`{{ item.new_text_field }} &lt;!— new field don't display —&gt;`\n`{% enfer %}`\n\nHas anyone ever encountered this situation ? What’s the hack ?\n\nThanks a lot",

    "text": "How do you modify a module used in production on a portal? If I clone module to develop it safely, I cannot replace the old one with the new one (the content will be erased). If I develop the module used in the portal, I can break something until the dev is finished. I think I can develop with a clone and, in the local environment, copy/paste the files content of the new module in the old ones. But is it safe? Is there another workflow to improve a module already in production on a portal?"
