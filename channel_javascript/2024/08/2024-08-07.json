    "text": "yeah, pdf libraries can be challenging. I find using a headless version of chrome and puppeteer to be the most successful, but Iâ€™ve found issues with HubSpot serverless timeout on these types of things, so I generally setup an external server with two endpoints to start a render, returning a job id, then another to get the status/file based upon job id if is ready.
