Is there alternatively any way of manually exporting knowledge articles to files?\n2. Is there a standard widget of HubSpot ServiceHub? Does this widget have an API, e.g. subscribing to webhooks on conversations started, messages sent, sending messages, and transfering chats? Have anyone integrated a 3rd party chatbot provider into this widget? Is the alternative to become a partner and get our widget here: <https://ecosystem.HubSpot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/live-chat> ?\n3. Is there an API for creating cases inside of HubSpot ServiceHub?\nSorry for potential noob questions, but I found it quite hard to distinguish what parts of the documentation covered Knowledge Hub and which covered CRM :slightly_smiling_face:"
