    "text": "Hi All! Question regarding a webhooks action that is activated in a HubSpot Workflow. I am trying to send a JSON POST to our sequencing tool when someone fills out a form to automate a sequence enrollment. In the webhook edit window, it does not let me choose the data points to send over along the post (i.e. first_name, last_name, email) so the webhook is failing. Am I missing something or does HubSpot not include these data points in the POST and I should just use zapier. I've gone through <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/workflows/how-do-i-use-webhooks-with-HubSpot-workflows|this knowledge base> many times, but it features nothing on the data.",

This post needs to include \"firstname, lastname, email, website\" I select a contact and run a test and it is success, but it doesn't let me change the outputs from the default. This is my issue. Do you think I'm actually overthinking and what HubSpot is doing is sending *every* data point across the webhook so I have more than enough info. Usually I have to map the properties to the fields needed in Amplemarket in order for it to work. It also says that there is an error to provide at least an email data field. Under outputs it says select more, but when I expand all in outputs, there is no clear way to select more. Are they clickable and I'm not realizing how (in screenshot 4)? :laughing:",

    "text": "<@U03NNR15ACB> Ok, so the problem is that Amplemarket isn't setup to parse out the body of the request (screenshot 4). So you will need to send a Webhook to Zapier first then use Zapier webhooks to send to Amplemarket. If you guys have Operations Hub Pro or Enterprise you can pretty easily setup a custom code action to accomplish this without Zapier. This problem is because HubSpot's webhook action is really underpowered, by not allowing you to customize the body or headers of the webhook."
