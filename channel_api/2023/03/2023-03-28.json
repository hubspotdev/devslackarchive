The conversations API does not have the option to create one but only modify or get an existing one.\nCould you give us guidance on how to achieve this, as we’re not finding a clear information in the documentation? Thank you!\nFYI: <@U0513B5HKEU> <@U050DLF1YMQ> <@U049WTE7AEB>",

HubSpot’s API poses some unique challenges for syncing/change data capture: limited webhook support, limited support for querying associations, mixed support for detecting deletes, and an eventually consistent search API.\n\nWe discuss things like:\n• schema introspection\n• using the search API for change detection\n• when eventual consistency happens and how to deal with it\n• how to sync associations\nWe decided to write our whole playbook up in case it would help others building on top of the HubSpot API. If you’re building a sync or change data capture pipeline on top of HubSpot’s API, I hope you find it useful :pray:\n\nIf we missed anything or you have other ideas on how to accomplish the same task, let me know.\n\n<https://blog.sequin.io/building-a-sync-on-HubSpots-api/>",
