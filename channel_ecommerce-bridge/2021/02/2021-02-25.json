    "text": "Hi guys! I’m new here but I have a question. I hired a software company to integrate my custom ecommerce to HubSpot, and they decided to not use the ecommerce bridge api because the V3 was under development and they didn’t want to use a soon-to-be deprecated API. Instead they used the deals API and contacts API. My question is: Will I lose some features by doing this? Can I implement, for instance, browse and cart abandonment flows under this actual configuration? Do you guys know when will the V3 available and if it will worth on using that instead of the actual setup we have? Thank you very much!",
