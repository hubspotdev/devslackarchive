We're looking for more effective ways to gather developer feedback this year, and it's awesome to hear we have willing participants :smile:  As you've well surfaced, there are lots of partner-based efforts underway, which is awesome, but we really want to clear the path for dev-specific feedback. I can't share more yet, but I can assure you that we are actively planning to roll out more effective feedback surfaces in 2023."
