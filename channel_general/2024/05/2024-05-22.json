    "text": "Hi everyone, I have an issue I would like to discuss with you:\nA client has a HubSpot portal but does not want to use the HubSpot cookie banner, preferring instead to use the Iubenda cookie banner. So far, this is not a problem because I thought of deactivating the HubSpot cookie banner and using the Iubenda script. However, to be compliant with the European GDPR, I need to block HubSpot cookies and reactivate them as <@U01QVR44MEY> suggested in an old thread with `_hsq.push(['doNotTrack', {track: true}])`.\nThe issue I'm facing is: are HubSpot cookies legally classified as functional, marketing, or analytical? How can I intelligently activate them by type? And most importantly, is there a list I can refer to? I'm doing this to be 100% compliant.\nIs there a smarter solution? Thank you very much.",

    "text": "Good morning everyone! I'm new here and I don't have a developer background so my apologies about it. I was hoping to have your help with an issue related to the cookies and tracking:\nIn our landing pages we are using One trust for cookies, and we want the HubSpot tracking to be trigger only if the user accepts the cookies in the banner. We implemented the \"do not track code\" so now it's tracking only when the user accepts cookies (all good) but the problem is that if the user rejects the cookies the tracking is being triggered. Do you have an idea of how it could be solved?\nThanks in advance",
