    "text": "Hello Everyone,I am currently working in the HubSpot Design Manager, where I am fetching and rendering data. When I switch to the Design Previewer, I can see the rendered data perfectly.\nI have manually added a choice field using the \"Add Fields\" option in the module and provided the required options manually. This field also renders correctly in the previewer.\nWhat I want to achieve is to dynamically add options to this choice field through the code I am writing in the Design Manager, instead of adding the options manually. I have attached screenshots for reference.\nIs it possible to achieve this? If so, how can I accomplish it? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Hi <@U079FBAFJ9Y>, it is technically impossible to load the options dynamically into the choice option. Like I've mentioned in <https://community.HubSpot.com/t5/CMS-Development/HubSpot-featured-select-field-in-design-manager/m-p/998054/highlight/true#M39671|this community post>.\n\nBut since you're working with HubDB you could utilize the <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/api/cms/hubdb|HubDB API> (or even upload the CSV) to modify the column with all options and use some <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/operators-and-expression-tests#containing|is containing> or <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/cms/hubl/operators-and-expression-tests#containingall|is containingall> rules.\n\nBut in either case you'd need to write the if-elif-else conditions manually"

    "text": "Thank you for your prompt response and clarification regarding the dynamic loading of options into the choice field. Your suggestion to use the HubDB API or upload a CSV to modify the column with all options is very helpful. I will explore these alternatives.\nBefore marking this(dynamic loading) as impossible to achieve, could you confirm if it is possible to manipulate the JSON in order to insert dynamic options? Any guidance or confirmation on this approach would be greatly appreciated.\n[\n {\n  \"choices\": [\n   [\n    \"BMW\",\n    \"BMW\"\n   ],\n   [\n    \"Audi\",\n    \"Audi\"\n   ],\n   [\n    \"Mercedes-Benz\",\n    \"Mercedes-Benz\"\n   ],\n   [\n    \"Ferrari\",\n    \"Ferrari\"\n   ]\n  ],\n  \"default\": \"Audi\",\n  \"display\": \"select\",\n  \"display_width\": null,\n  \"id\": \"c26409f3-0631-148a-abbf-2a894ca16706\",\n  \"label\": \"Make\",\n  \"locked\": false,\n  \"multiple\": false,\n  \"name\": \"choice_field\",\n  \"preset\": null,\n  \"reordering_enabled\": true,\n  \"required\": false,\n  \"type\": \"choice\"\n },\n]"
