It seems that variable in for/if loops are scope specific so I have to use an object as a variable and use the `.update` command in the for/if loop to update it.  Anyone know a better way? Here’s what I have but its clumsy. Id like some array search/find function for this but doesn’t seem there is one.\n```{# Extract total fees  from items #}\n{% set total = { fee: 0 } %}  \n\n{% for item in items %} \n    {% if some_variable == item.id %}      \n      {%  do total.update({ fee: total.fee + item.rate })  %}      \n    {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}```"

As far as I understand, `standard_footer_includes` loads the base modules and some HubSpot Analytics scripts.\nHow can I overwrite a base module like `image_slider_gallery` or edit the analytics scripts that are called?\nThanks!"
