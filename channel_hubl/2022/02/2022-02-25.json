    "text": "I seem to be suddenly having a problem with modules importing macros from other files (something I've been doing without issue for quite a while and is pretty important to my whole setup). Basically, I've got a global components file which contains a bunch of things that are used in lots of modules (such as a macro for rendering breadcrumbs, a macro for rendering star icons, a macro for a sort of general module wrapper, and so on). I have a line like this at the top of most modules:\n`{% import '../../../partials/global-head.html' as components %}`\n(the file is shared with some of the global head stuff like adding stylesheets, mostly for historical reasons)\n_Variables_ in this file work fine, but if I try to use a macro I get an error that looks something like:\n`[ERROR] line -1: Error in /module-path/module.html on line 1: Cannot find method breadcrumbs with 2 parameters in class com.HubSpot.jinjava.objects.collections.SizeLimitingPyMap`\nThis also happens if I try to do it as `{% from ... import ... %}`  instead, and it happens in both the CLI and the online editor. If I use the online editor, the preview seems to work as I expect, but of course it won't let me publish.  There's also a warning that says the template is missing. Also, if I just echo `{{ components|tojson }}` or `{{ components.breadcrumbs|tojson }}` it shows the macro I'm trying to use in there.\nIt seemed to be working fine until around an hour ago? I really hope I don't have to go copy+paste all my macros everywhere :confused:",
