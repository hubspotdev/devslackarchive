He is trying to change the template on an existing page from one with no dnd (but has preset modules in it) to one with dnd, but none of the dnd templates show up as an option when trying to change the template. I have found several articles about flexible column templates not being able to switch to dnd templates but we didn't use flex columns. Is it still just an issue switching from no dnd to dnd?"
