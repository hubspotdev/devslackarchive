If I remove the LANDING_PAGE value from my content_types array in the meta,json -&gt; upload my module -&gt; then add the Landing Page type through the design manager, it works. For some reason it seems that adjusting this value directly in the meta.json file and uploading it for an already existing module doesn't trigger any change within HS. But changing it through the design manager does."
