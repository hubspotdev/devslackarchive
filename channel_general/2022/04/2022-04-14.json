    "text": "Thanks <@U26BLKGE4>. I take your point. It makes sense operationally, but there is also a reality in which several IT companies and Enterprise clients still rely on IP's for whitelisting, etc, and this issue is also somewhat unique to HubSpot as a \"host,\" which other hosting providers do not have an issue providing. That's really all I was getting at. The good new is that I may have found a workaround anyway because HubSpot does provide a static IP if you attach a root domain in CMS Enterprise. It's not 100% full-proof and it's not \"dedicated\" but it is static, which helps in these types of situations. Just thought I would pass along in case it was ever useful to you. Thanks again!"
