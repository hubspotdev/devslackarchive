    "text": "Hi guys, I have a row called `order_by` in my database. What I want to try and do is order components/objects on that specific field. For instance I want the order value of 1 to be the first object on the list and number 2 the second etc. and all other objects that do not have an id will be sorted last. I have used this `orderBy=display_order` , but instead of ordering from number 1 it starts ordering the fields that have either 0 or null first. How can I fix this?",
