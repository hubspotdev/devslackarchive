    "text": "Hey Everyone, I'm attempting to use the Web Analytics endpoint in a React Card. I'm getting an error on the api call that it's out of scope, and needs either of these permissions - [event-detail-read,web-analytics-api-access]. I do not see these permissions in Private Apps, what do I need to do to have them listed there? It is in beta, but I didn't see it in the list to join (I may just be missing it). Thanks in advance for your help!",
