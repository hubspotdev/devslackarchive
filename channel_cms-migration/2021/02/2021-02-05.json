I saw a similar question to the one that I have: <https://HubSpotdev.slack.com/archives/CMY8QHGPQ/p1606918216008200>.\n\nI don't see any responses to this so I am wondering if anyone has any new input? Feel free to PM me or reply in a thread for better visibility. Thanks in advance!\n\n******************"
