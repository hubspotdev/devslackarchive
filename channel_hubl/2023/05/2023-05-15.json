    "text": "Hi, I have given up on Hubl. I have created custom templates. The date and time function is always off regarding the time of the events that are from the database. I live in the pacific los angeles time zone here and my time is always off. I have tried everything possible with getting the time accurate. I am not sure why the time isn't working as intended.  The template I create is broken I had to adjust the timestamp to get an accurate time zone but why do I need to do all that. Here's an example I have an event that is in the database as 05-15-2023 @ 5pm when pulled directly from the DB to hubl with los angeles time zone setting in the account using only the format_time('hh:mm a','America/Los_Angeles') function it comes out as 10:42 am. I have given up on this it randomly broke via timezone, I think Hubl is terrible, I am an experienced developer that would be the first to say the time and dates should be the easiest things to manage to get right like in javascript or PHP for example.  I don't think that Hubl is fully polished for professional use and needs to be fixed because it puts unnecessary pressure on developers with baffled content managers having unrealistic expectations but I don't blame them when it does look correct from their point of view. Why are the timezones so hard to manage in Hubl?"

    "text": "Unfortunately, I don't think it's possible, but I really like the idea. One option is that you can use {% dnd_module %} tags to specify and add specific modules to your drag and drop areas. This way, only the specified modules will be added to the template by default. But, keep in mind that the content editor will still be able to add other modules to the dnd_area if they choose to do so.\n\nFor example:\n```{% dnd_area \"unique_name\", class=\"main\" %}\n  {% dnd_module path=\"custom/module/path\" %}\n  {% end_dnd_module %}\n{% end_dnd_area %}```\nAnother option could be to setup custom sections and then use those sections inside of the area tags but again this would just act as a template and would necessarily restrict"
