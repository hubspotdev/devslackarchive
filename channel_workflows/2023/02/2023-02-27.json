    "text": "Hi all, I am new to HubSpot. I have to develop a webhook API for the workflow integration, when looked into the documentation, it has 2 options for the authentication using *request signature or using API key.* We have a private app set up in HubSpot.\nCan you please guide me if you ever worked on it, which authentication did you prefer? Did you add any additional authentication in the API apart from it? TIA.
