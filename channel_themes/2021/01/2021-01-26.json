    "text": "Hi. This case is probably for the HubSpot Team. So, I have this weird problem with HubSpot's Session -theme.\n1. Session -theme works fine\n2. I clone the theme, so I can make changes to it. \n3. When I start to create pages with the cloned theme -&gt; drag and drop element won't show me the Section and Column choices when hovering mouse over content elements (screenshot below). Because of this I can't delete Sections from the page. I can only go to the Sections -settings. \n4. I think that the problem is that edit page gives multiple 403 errors from the svg-files (screenshot below). This happens with all different templates inside the theme. Here is a one example of those 403 address: <https://static.hsappstatic.net/content-icons-ui/static-1.1425/images/fontawesome-5.0.10/Rookie/images/module-icons/list-view.svg/default.svg>\nAccound ID: 8270041\nCloned theme name: Rookie",
