I followed this instruction <https://www.3whitehats.com/knowledge/tracking-HubSpot-forms-google-tag-manager/> , yet the events of form submission don't show in ga. I guess the problem is that I write a variable in a layer field  in a tag (screenshot attached), yet I don't know how to indicate the same variable in GA event.",

I used some custom hubl variables on the blog detail pages and i want to show them on the overview as well:\n\ndot_date_start\ndot_date_end\ndot_event_location_adress\ndot_event_price\n\nOn the blog detailpage i copied the snipped and pasted into the templates. I can show all information with module.(...)\nOn the overviewpage they should display with row[0], row[1] etc. But i only got the green highlighted. *Correction*: dot_date_start and dot_date_end is not correct. It's the wrong date.\n\nCan anybody give me a little hint?",
