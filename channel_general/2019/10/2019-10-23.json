    "text": "but it's a different use-case, usually contentful is more for publishing apps on multiple platforms rather than just a traditional website CMS, at least from what I've seen (also thought they had a free tier for small instances but I could be wrong on that).\n\nThe one I've used most for personal projects/experimenting is Strapi. Looking at the pricing of a few different options, the closest paid options to how HS CMS would would work would probably be Storyblok and Prismic. (Other options: <https://headlesscms.org/>).\n\nThe big difference between HS CMS and a lot of these other premium services is the flexibility around the data model. A lot of them price per custom-model, like in the contentful example \"24 content types.\" Each of those content types can be customized with different fields and stored in different ways. The closest example I could think of on HS CMS would be if we as users could customize a \"page editor\" tool to match up with a HubDB table.\n\nAnyway, for your other two points:\n\n*is it possible* Kinda. Most of my experience with headless and SSGs is via Gatsby, and there is an existing, albeit limited, source plugin for HubSpot (<https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-HubSpot/>). Theoretically, in the build process you would script getting the vital fields from most of the HS CMS objects (pages and posts) via the API or a plugin wrapper like this one and get a lot of the data you would need to build the static pages.\n\nHowever, where things would get tricky is dealing with layout and previews. In order to have a visual preview in HubSpot, you would basically need to build your theme twice, once for HS CMS purposes and once for your SSG. I'd be interested to try with Pelican, which looks like a Jinja-based SSG: <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican>"
