    "text": "Hey all! We are new to HubSpot and, even though we’ve done a lot of research, we couldn’t find a way to implement our SEO strategy using subdirectories (instead of subdomains). In other words, we would like to foster the reputation of our “www.” subdomain, having “/blog/[CONTENT]” in our posts. Did someone manage to work like this using HS CMS or HS Mkt Hub? thanks! cc <@U043NMX0JDN>",
