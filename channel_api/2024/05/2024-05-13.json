We use Zapier to create & update contacts on HS.\n\nOne possible solution is to use google tag manager to create real-time contact/ email on HS & then Zapier to update. Again, just researching/ thinking, let me know if you find a way  out or if you have already tried this out.\nThanks!"

I have a custom workflow action, created by API, that is configured to support all object types, but when I go into my custom workflow action and try \"Insert data\" and use Contact properties to personalize the field values, it says \"We don't currently support this data source and its properties in the selected field.\"\n\nI have tried `supportedValueTypes` of both \"OBJECT_PROPERTY\" and \"STATIC_VALUE\", but neither allow non-enrolled (associated) object tokens, and neither work.\n\nAny tips?
