Error starts with the following message\n```ERR! code 1\nnpm ERR! path /Users/user/Desktop/hubex/react-app/node_modules/node-sass\nnpm ERR! command failed\nnpm ERR! command sh -c node scripts/build.js```\nThis worked last time I was creating one but for some reason it doesn't work now. Anyone had a similar issue?\nI believe it's a dependency issue and I tried changing versions of node-sass and sass-loader but I couldn't make it work",
