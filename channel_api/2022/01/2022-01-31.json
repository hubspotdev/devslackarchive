While we do our best to avoid <https://developers.HubSpot.com/docs/breaking-change-definition|breaking changes> to our APIs, sometimes for security, and reliability we have to. The Changelog is where we’ll post announcements ahead of time about it. <https://developers.HubSpot.com/changelog|Subscribe to the Developer Changelog> to stay up-to-date on what’s happening in the world of HubSpot development."
