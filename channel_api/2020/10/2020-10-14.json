New here, apologies if this is the wrong channel.\n\nI have a question about the Ecom bridge API - it appears that if a contact has been deleted manually from the CRM in the past, the Ecom bridge API can not re-add the same contact back in to the CRM.\n\nIs this the case? If so, is there a work around?"
