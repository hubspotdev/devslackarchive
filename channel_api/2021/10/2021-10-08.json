If you don’t know who it is, then the event will associate with a record if the identity is already known (ie from a previous form submission)\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that there’s a Chrome extension that can help you make ‘clicked element’ events without having to write your own JS -  <https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/analytics-tools/create-clicked-element-events#install-the-event-chrome-extension|https://knowledge.HubSpot.com/analytics-tools/create-clicked-element-events#install-the-event-chrome-extension>"

I'm not very clear what the use case is for all those fields, it feels like it could be really cool but I am not sure I get the value.\n\nWhat I have had a number of people internally ask me about lately is the ability to do things like track \"quantity of X over time\" which Mixpanel does really well."
